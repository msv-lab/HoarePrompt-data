The code `print(res)` prints the value of the variable `res`. However, in the initial state, `results` is a non-empty iterable, but there is no mention of `res` being assigned a value or having any relation to `results`. Since `res` is not defined before the print statement, the output will depend on what `res` holds at the time of execution. Given the initial state, `res` could be any non-empty iterable, but its exact value is not specified.

Since the code does not assign a specific value to `res` and only prints it, the output state will include the fact that `res` was printed, but the exact value of `res` remains unspecified from the given information.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty iterable, and `res` is printed**
