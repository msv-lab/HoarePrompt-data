Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `low` is 0
   - `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`
   - `mid` is 0
   - `answer` is `max(n, m) * 20`
   - `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`
   - `p` is 0
   - `q_inv` is 1
   - `result` is `0 % MOD`
   - `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`
   - `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`
   - `idx` is increased by 3

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `low <= high`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `low <= high` must be true.
   - Initially, `low` is 0 and `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`.
   - Since `low` (0) is indeed less than or equal to `high` (`max(n, m) * 20`), the loop condition is already satisfied.

4. **No Adjustment Needed:**
   - There is no need to adjust any state because the initial values of `low` and `high` already satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the program state right before the loop is already sufficient for the loop to execute at least one iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `mid` is 0, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is 0, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is increased by 3**
