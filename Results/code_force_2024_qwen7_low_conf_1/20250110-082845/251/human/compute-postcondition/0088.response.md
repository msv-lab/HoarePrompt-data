Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`.
   - `mid` is `max(n, m)`.
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, then `answer` is set to `max(n, m)` and `high` is set to `max(n, m) - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `low` is set to `max(n, m) + 1` and `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is False.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure the condition `low <= high` holds true.
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, then `high` is set to `max(n, m) - 1`, which would make `low > high` if `low` is still 0. Therefore, `low` must be set to a value greater than `max(n, m) - 1` to ensure `low <= high` is true.
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns False, then `low` is set to `max(n, m) + 1`, which is already greater than `high` (`2 * max(n, m)`).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` must return True, and `low` must be set to a value greater than `max(n, m) - 1`.

Therefore, the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `low` must be greater than `max(n, m) - 1`.

State: **`low` is greater than `max(n, m) - 1`, `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`, `mid` is `max(n, m)`**
