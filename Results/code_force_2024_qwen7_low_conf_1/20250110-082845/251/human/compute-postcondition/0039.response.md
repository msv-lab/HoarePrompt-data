The `results` list is appended with the value of `result`. The value of `result` is `p * 1 % MOD`, which simplifies to `p % MOD` because multiplying by 1 does not change the value. Given the initial state, `p` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`). So, `result` is `low % MOD`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `answer` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `low % MOD`, `results` contains `[low % MOD]`**
