The code `q_inv = pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)` calculates the modular inverse of `q` under modulo `MOD`. Given that `q` is 1, the modular inverse of 1 under any modulo `MOD` is 1, because \(1^{-1} \equiv 1 \mod{MOD}\). 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 0, `high` is 0, `mid` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value for which `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, `p` is `answer`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is 0 % MOD, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is increased by 3, `q` is 1, and `q_inv` is 1.
