The code assigns the value of `mid` to `answer`. Given the initial state, `low` is 0, `high` is 2 * max(n, m), and `mid` is max(n, m), and the function `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to True. After executing the line `answer = mid`, the value of `answer` is set to `mid`, which is max(n, m).

Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 0, `high` is 2 * max(n, m), `mid` is max(n, m), and `answer` is max(n, m).

Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is 2 * max(n, m), `mid` is max(n, m), `answer` is max(n, m)**
