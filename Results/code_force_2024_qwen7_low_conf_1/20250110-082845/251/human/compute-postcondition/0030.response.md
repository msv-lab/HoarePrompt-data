`answer` is assigned the value of `mid`. Given the initial state, `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), and `answer` becomes this same value. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), `low` remains unchanged or updates to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\), `high` is \(((low + high) // 2) - 1\) or remains unchanged, `answer` is \((low + high) // 2\)**
