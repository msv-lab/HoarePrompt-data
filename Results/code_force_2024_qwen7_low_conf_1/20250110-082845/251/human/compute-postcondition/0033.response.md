Postcondition: **`mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), `low` remains unchanged or updates to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\), `high` is now either `mid - 1` or remains unchanged, `answer` is \((low + high) // 2\). If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, then `high` becomes `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `low` becomes \((low + high) // 2 + 1\).**
