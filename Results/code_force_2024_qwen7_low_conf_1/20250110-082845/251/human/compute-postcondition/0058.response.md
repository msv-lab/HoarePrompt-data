The code `high = mid - 1` changes the value of `high` by subtracting 1 from `mid`. Since `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `high` will now be `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.

Output State: **`low` is 0 or `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `high` is `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is `0`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, and `idx` is increased by `3`.
