The code snippet sets `high` to `mid - 1`. Based on the initial state, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`. Therefore, `high` will be set to `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is 0, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is increased by 3, the condition `(func_2(n, m, k, mid))` is true**
