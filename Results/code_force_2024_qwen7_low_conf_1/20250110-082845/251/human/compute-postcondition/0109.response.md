According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` iterable. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a non-empty iterable, and `res` is the current element that was printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `results` must still be a non-empty iterable.
2. The next element in the iterable should be assigned to `res`.

Since the loop is about to iterate again, `results` must still contain at least one element, and `res` will be set to the next element in the iterable.

State: **`results` is a non-empty iterable, and `res` will be the next element in the iterable**
