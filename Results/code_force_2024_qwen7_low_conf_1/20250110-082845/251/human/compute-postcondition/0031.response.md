The code `high = mid - 1` changes the value of `high` from its previous state. Initially, `high` was equal to `((low + high) // 2) - 1` or remained unchanged. After executing the code, `high` is now updated to `mid - 1`. The other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), `low` remains unchanged or updates to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\), `high` is now `mid - 1`, `answer` is \((low + high) // 2\)**
