The code `print(res)` prints the next element in the iterable `results`. Since `res` was set to be the next element in the iterable `results`, printing `res` simply outputs this next element. The value of `results` remains unchanged, and `res` is no longer specifically tied to the next element in the iterable after the print statement.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty iterable, and `res` has been printed, with its value being the next element in `results`.**
