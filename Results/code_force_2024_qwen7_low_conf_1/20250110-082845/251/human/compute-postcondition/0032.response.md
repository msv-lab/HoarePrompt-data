The code `low = mid + 1` changes the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. Based on the initial state, `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\). Therefore, the new value of `low` is \((low + high) // 2 + 1\). The other variables (`high` and `answer`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`mid` is \((low + high) // 2\); `low` is \((low + high) // 2 + 1\); `high` is \(((low + high) // 2) - 1\) or remains unchanged; `answer` is \((low + high) // 2\)**
