The code `idx += 3` increments the value of `idx` by 3. The initial value of `idx` was such that `n` and `m` were assigned as `int(data[idx])` and `int(data[idx + 1])` respectively, and `k` was assigned as `int(data[idx + 2])`. After incrementing `idx` by 3, the new value of `idx` will be the original value plus 3.

Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is 0, `mid` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value for which `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, `p` is `answer`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` now contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD), answer % MOD]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is the original value of `idx` plus 3, `q` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[idx - 3])`, `m` is `int(data[idx - 2])`.
