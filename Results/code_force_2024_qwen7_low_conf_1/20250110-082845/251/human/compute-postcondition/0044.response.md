The code `idx += 3` increments the value of `idx` by 3. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `idx` and retains the values of all other variables from the initial state.

Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `answer` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `low % MOD`, `results` contains `[low % MOD, (low % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is increased by 3.**
