To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and its variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \( \text{max}(n, m) \times 20 \)
- `mid` is 0
- `answer` is \( \text{max}(n, m) \times 20 \)
- `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`
- `p` is 0
- `q_inv` is 1
- `result` is 0 % MOD
- `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`
- `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`
- `idx` is increased by 3

### Loop Behavior:
- The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.
- On each iteration:
  - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
  - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, then `answer` is set to `mid`, and `high` is set to `mid - 1`.
  - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `False`, then `low` is set to `mid + 1`.

### Iterations Analysis:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `low` is 0
   - `high` is \( \text{max}(n, m) \times 20 \)
   - `mid` is 10 (assuming `max(n, m) = 10` for simplicity)
   - Since `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is `True`, `answer` is set to `10`, and `high` becomes 9.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `low` is 0
   - `high` is 9
   - `mid` is 4 (average of 0 and 9)
   - Since `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is `True`, `answer` is set to `10`, and `high` becomes 3.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `low` is 0
   - `high` is 3
   - `mid` is 1 (average of 0 and 3)
   - Since `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is `True`, `answer` is set to `10`, and `high` becomes 0.

4. **Fourth Iteration**:
   - `low` is 0
   - `high` is 0
   - `mid` is 0
   - Since `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is `True`, `answer` is set to `0`, and `high` becomes -1 (loop terminates).

### Final State:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is 0
- `mid` is 0
- `answer` is the smallest value for which `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`
- `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`
- `p` is 0
- `q_inv` is 1
- `result` is 0 % MOD
- `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`
- `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`
- `idx` is increased by 3

### Output State:
Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is 0, `mid` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value for which `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is 0, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is 0 % MOD, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, and `idx` is increased by 3.**
