The code sets `answer` to `high`. Given the initial state, `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is max(n, m) * 20, `mid` is 0, `answer` is max(n, m) * 20, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is 0, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is 0 % MOD, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is increased by 3.**
