According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` iterable. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a non-empty iterable, and `res` has been printed with its value being the next element in `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element. Since `res` has just been printed, it means that the current element has been consumed. Therefore, `results` must now be an iterable with at least one remaining element.

State: **`results` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining element**.
