Reasoning:

1. **Main Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The main function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It uses a binary search approach to find the minimum number of steps (`answer`) such that the area of the paper is strictly less than `k`.
   - The search range is set to `[0, max(n, m) * 20]`. Given the constraints, this range is likely sufficient to cover all possible values of `p` (number of steps required).
   - The binary search correctly updates the `high` and `low` bounds based on whether the current middle value satisfies the condition `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`.
   - The function calculates the modular inverse of `q` and then computes the result using the formula `p * q_inv % MOD`.

2. **Supporting Function (`func_2`)**:
   - This function simulates the process of cutting the paper and checks if the area becomes less than `k` after a certain number of steps.
   - It correctly handles the halving of dimensions and ensures that neither dimension falls below 1.
   - The function returns `True` if the area is less than `k` after the specified number of steps; otherwise, it returns `None`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not explicitly handle the case where `n` or `m` is zero. While this is unlikely given the problem constraints, it is essential to ensure robustness by adding a check for zero dimensions.
   - The code also assumes that the input constraints are met, and it does not validate the inputs.

Given the above points, the code appears to be logically sound and should work correctly under the given constraints. However, there are minor improvements that can be made, such as adding explicit zero dimension checks and ensuring the binary search range is robust.

Correctness: **True**
