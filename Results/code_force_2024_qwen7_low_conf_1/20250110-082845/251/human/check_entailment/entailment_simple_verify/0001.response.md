### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases as specified.
   - Variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are initialized correctly from the input.
   - The variable `MOD` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is the correct modulus for the final result.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The `func_2` function implements a binary search to find the minimum number of steps required to make the area strictly less than `k`.
   - The binary search iteratively reduces the dimensions of the rectangle by half, ensuring the area is halved in each step.
   - The function checks if the current area is less than `k` and returns `True` if it is, indicating the correct number of steps.

3. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area is halved in each step, either vertically or horizontally, depending on which dimension is larger.
   - This ensures that the search space is reduced efficiently, and the binary search converges to the correct number of steps.

4. **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
   - The final result is calculated using modular inverse (`q_inv`) to ensure the output is in the required format.
   - The calculation `p * q_inv % MOD` is performed correctly, ensuring the result is within the required bounds.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the initial area is already less than `k`, and it does not require any cuts.
   - The function correctly handles the case when the dimensions are reduced to `1` by `1`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case as specified, and the output format is correct.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program appears to follow the correct logic and constraints. There are no apparent logical errors or mismatches between the problem statement and the code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem specification accurately.
