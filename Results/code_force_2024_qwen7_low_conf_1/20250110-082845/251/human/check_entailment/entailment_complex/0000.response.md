Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly reads input and processes multiple test cases using a binary search approach.
   - It sets up the binary search range to be `[0, max(n, m) * 20]` and ensures that the search space is reasonable given the constraints.
   - The function uses `func_2` to check if a given number of steps will make the area of the paper strictly less than `k`.
   - It calculates the expected number of steps by finding the smallest number of steps such that the area is less than `k` and computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function correctly simulates the cutting process by halving the dimensions of the paper.
   - It ensures that both dimensions remain at least 1 after each halving.
   - The function returns `True` if, after the specified number of steps, the product of the dimensions is less than `k`, indicating that the area is strictly less than `k`.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem statement.
   - The binary search is used to find the minimum number of steps required, and the calculations are done correctly using modular arithmetic.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
