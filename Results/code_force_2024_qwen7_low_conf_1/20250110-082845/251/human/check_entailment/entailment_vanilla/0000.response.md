Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases as specified.
2. The `func_1` function initializes necessary variables and calls `func_2` to determine the expected number of steps.
3. The binary search implemented in `func_2` is used to find the minimum number of steps required to make the area strictly less than `k`.
4. The area is halved in each step, either vertically or horizontally, depending on which dimension is larger.
5. The function `func_2` returns `True` when the area becomes strictly less than `k`, indicating the correct number of steps.
6. The final result is calculated using modular inverse, ensuring the output is in the required format.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program appears to follow the correct logic and constraints. There are no apparent logical errors or mismatches between the problem statement and the code.

Correctness: **True**
