### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Processing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases as specified. This part is handled by `func_1`, where the input is read and split into individual test cases.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search implemented in `func_2` aims to find the minimum number of steps required to make the area strictly less than `k`. The range of the binary search is `[0, max(n, m) * 20]`. While this range seems reasonable for the given constraints, there is a potential issue with how `func_2` handles the cutting process.

3. **Cutting Process:**
   - In `func_2`, the dimensions `h` and `w` are halved in each step, either vertically or horizontally, depending on which dimension is larger. This logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with the condition `if h * w < k`. This condition checks if the product of `h` and `w` is less than `k` after each step. If `h` and `w` are both 1 (i.e., they are reduced to their smallest possible values), the product will be 1, which is always less than `k` (since `k` is at least 2). This means the function will always return `True` in the last iteration, leading to an incorrect result.

4. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The final result is calculated using modular inverse (`pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)`), ensuring the output is in the required format. This part is correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where `n` or `m` is equal to zero, which could lead to undefined behavior. Although this is unlikely due to the problem constraints, it should still be addressed for robustness.

### Conclusion:

While the overall structure and logic of the program seem correct, the binary search implementation in `func_2` has a critical flaw. Specifically, the condition `if h * w < k` in `func_2` will always return `True` in the last iteration if `h` and `w` are both 1, leading to an incorrect result. This flaw affects the accuracy of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flaw in the binary search implementation in `func_2`.
