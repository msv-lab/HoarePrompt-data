Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the expected behavior as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` is used to determine the number of steps required to reduce the area of the paper strictly below `k`. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not accurately simulate the random cutting process described in the problem.

In the problem, the sheet is cut randomly along the lines `x = 1, 2, ..., w-1` and `y = 1, 2, ..., h-1`. The provided implementation, however, simply halves the dimensions sequentially without considering randomness or the fact that both dimensions can be reduced in each step. This means that the function does not account for the probabilistic nature of the cuts, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider a test case where `n = 2`, `m = 2`, and `k = 2`. According to the problem description, after the first cut, there are four possible resulting areas: 1, 1, 1, and 1 (since the cuts can be made in either direction). The expected number of steps to get an area strictly less than 2 is 1, but the provided code might incorrectly calculate a different value due to its deterministic approach.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not simulate the random cutting process as required by the problem statement.
