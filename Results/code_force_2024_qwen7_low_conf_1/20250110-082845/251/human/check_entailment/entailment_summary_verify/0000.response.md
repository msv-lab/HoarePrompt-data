### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its components to determine if it correctly simulates the random cutting process described in the problem statement.

#### Problem Description and Requirements
- The sheet of paper can be cut along lines \( x = 1, 2, \ldots, w-1 \) and \( y = 1, 2, \ldots, h-1 \).
- Each cut is made randomly.
- After each cut, the right and bottom pieces are discarded.
- We need to find the expected number of steps to make the area strictly less than \( k \).

#### Function `func_2`
- This function aims to simulate the reduction of the area of the sheet after a certain number of steps.
- It halves the dimensions sequentially until the area is less than \( k \).
- This deterministic approach does not account for the randomness in the cuts.

#### Function `func_1`
- This function reads input, processes each test case, and uses `func_2` to determine the number of steps.
- It performs binary search to find the minimum number of steps required to make the area strictly less than \( k \).
- The logic inside `func_2` is flawed because it does not simulate the random cutting process.

#### Correctness Analysis
- The function `func_2` incorrectly assumes that the dimensions can only be halved sequentially, which does not match the random cutting process.
- The problem requires the area to be strictly less than \( k \) after a random sequence of cuts.
- The provided implementation does not capture the probabilistic nature of the cuts, leading to incorrect results.

#### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly simulate the random cutting process as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
