Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Processing**: The `func_1` function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases as specified. This part of the assessment is accurate.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_2` function implements a binary search to find the minimum number of steps required to make the area strictly less than `k`. However, there are some issues with the logic:
   - The function `func_2` should ensure that both `h` and `w` are at least 1 after each iteration, but the current implementation only ensures that `h` and `w` are at least 1 when they are halved. This could lead to incorrect results if `h` or `w` becomes 0 before being halved.
   - The binary search in `func_1` uses `high = max(n, m) * 20`, which is a heuristic value and might not be optimal. While this is a common approach, it might not cover all edge cases efficiently.

3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The calculation of `p * q_inv % MOD` is correct, and the use of `pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)` to compute the modular inverse is appropriate.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is correct, and the result is printed in the required format.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_2`:
- When `h` and `w` are halved, they should be rounded down to the nearest integer to ensure they remain positive integers. Currently, the code only ensures that `h` and `w` are at least 1 after being halved, but does not explicitly handle the case where they become 0 before being halved. For example, if `h` or `w` is 1, halving it would result in 0, which is not allowed.

To fix this, the code should ensure that `h` and `w` are at least 1 after each iteration. Here is the corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(n, m, k, steps):
    import math
    (h, w) = (n, m)
    for _ in range(steps):
        if h > w:
            h = max(h // 2, 1)
        else:
            w = max(w // 2, 1)
        if h * w < k:
            return True
    return h * w < k
```

Given the above issues, the original assessment is not entirely accurate because the program might produce incorrect results due to the handling of `h` and `w` becoming 0 before being halved.

Final: **False**
