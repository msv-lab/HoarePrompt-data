`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` contains the smallest `max_size - 1` elements from the list `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for `j` in the range of `max_size - 1`, removing the smallest element means that the new smallest element in `h` will be the second smallest element from the original list. The value of `j` is `max_size - 1`, so the removed element was the smallest element, which was the first smallest element from the original list.

- `j` remains `max_size - 1`.
- `max_size` remains greater than 0.
- `h` loses its smallest element, which is the first smallest element from the original list, and now contains the remaining `max_size - 2` smallest elements.
- `output` is initially set as `max_size * h[0]`, where `h[0]` is the new smallest element in `h`.
- `len(h)` is now `max_size - 2`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `j` is `max_size - 1`.
- `max_size` is greater than 0.
- `h` is a heap containing the `max_size - 2` smallest elements from the original list.
- `output` is `max_size * h[0]`, where `h[0]` is the new smallest element in `h`.
- `len(h)` is `max_size - 2`.

Output State: **`j` is `max_size - 1`; `max_size` is greater than 0; `h` is a heap containing the `max_size - 2` smallest elements from the original list; `output` is `max_size * h[0]`; `len(h)` is `max_size - 2`**
