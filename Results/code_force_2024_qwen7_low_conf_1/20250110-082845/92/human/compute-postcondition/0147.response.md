Postcondition: **`j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `h` is the heap with one element removed, and its smallest element is stored in `h[0]`, `output` is the tuple \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{smallest element in } h, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\), the length of `h` is greater than 1**
