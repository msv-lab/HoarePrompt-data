Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, `h` is a heap containing exactly `max_size` elements, `j` is `max_size - 1`, `output` is `h[0] * l, l` (if `h[0] * l >= output[0]`), `len(h)` is now `max_size`, and the new root of the heap (`h[0]`) may be larger or smaller than the value at `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`.***
