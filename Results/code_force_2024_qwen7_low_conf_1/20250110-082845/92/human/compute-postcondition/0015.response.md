The code assigns the value of `strength` to `max_strength`. Given that `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, the value of `max_strength` is updated to `2 * v_sorted[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, `min_mushrooms` is 1, `i` is 2, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`**
