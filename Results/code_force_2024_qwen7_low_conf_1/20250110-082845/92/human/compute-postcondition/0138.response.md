`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` contains elements `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for \(j\) ranging from 0 to \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\), the smallest element in `h` is removed. The value of `j`, `max_size`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\); `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2\); `h` is the heap with one element removed (the smallest element); `n` is even**
