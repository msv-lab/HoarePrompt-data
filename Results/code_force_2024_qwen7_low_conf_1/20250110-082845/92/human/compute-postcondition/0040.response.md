The `heapq.heappop(h)` function removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. This operation will affect the value of `h`, specifically reducing its size by one and potentially changing its structure. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided conditions.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is adjusted based on the condition (either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\)), `h` has one less element than before (the smallest element has been removed), `j` is either 0 or `max_size - 1`, `output` is either unchanged or updated to \(h[0] \times l\) (where \(l\) is a value such that \(h[0] \times l \geq output[0]\) if possible), and the new root of the heap (`h[0]`) may be larger or smaller than the value at `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` if the else part is executed.**
