Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is adjusted based on the condition (either `(n + 2) // 2` or `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`), `h` is a heap containing either 1 element or `max_size` elements, `j` is either 0 or `max_size - 1`, `output` is either unchanged or updated to `h[0] * l, l` (where `l` is a value such that `h[0] * l >= output[0]` if possible), and the new root of the heap (`h[0]`) may be larger or smaller than the value at `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` if the else part is executed.***
