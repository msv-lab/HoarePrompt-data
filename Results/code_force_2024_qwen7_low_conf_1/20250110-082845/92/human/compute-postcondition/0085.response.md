The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions and the fact that the `break` statement is not inside a loop or conditional block that affects the variables `j`, `max_size`, `h`, `output`, or `v`, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` contains the smallest `max_size - 1` elements from the list `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for `j` in the range of `max_size - 1`, `output` is `h[0], 1`, and the length of `h` is 1.**
