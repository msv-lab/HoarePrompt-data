`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` does not contain its smallest element initially, after calling `heapq.heappop(h)`, `h` will now contain its smallest element. The length of `h` (`l`) will be reduced by 1.

Output State: **`h` does not contain its smallest element before the operation but now contains its smallest element; `l` is `l - 1`**
