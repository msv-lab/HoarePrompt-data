Postcondition: **`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` is a heap containing `max_size - 2` smallest elements, including the minimum of `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` and `h[0]`, `output` is `max_size * h[0]`, `len(h)` is `max_size - 2`, `l` is `max_size - 2`, the first element of `h` is less than `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, and the current value of `output` is `max_size * h[0]` if `h[0] * l >= output[0]`**
