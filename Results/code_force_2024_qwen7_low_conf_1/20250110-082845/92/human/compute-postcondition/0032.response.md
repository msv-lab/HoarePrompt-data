Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, `h` is a heap containing exactly `max_size` elements, `j` is `max_size - 1`, `output` is `((n + 2) // 2) * h[0], ((n + 2) // 2) - 1, len(h)` is now `max_size`, and the new root of the heap (`h[0]`) may be larger or smaller than the value at `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`. Additionally, `h[0] * l` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`***
