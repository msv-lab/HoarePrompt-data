The code `heapq.heappush(h, v[p[l - 1] - 1])` pushes the element `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` into the heap `h`. Given the initial state:

- `j` is `max_size - 1`
- `max_size` is greater than 0
- `h` contains the next smallest `max_size - 2` elements except the smallest one
- `l` is `max_size - 3`
- `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 1), max_size`

Let's determine the impact on each variable:

1. `j` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
2. `max_size` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
3. `h` gets a new element pushed into it, which is `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`.
4. `l` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
5. `output` remains unchanged because the code does not directly affect it.

Since `h` is a heap, after pushing the new element, `h` will still contain the next smallest `max_size - 1` elements except the smallest one. The exact order in the heap might change, but this information is not needed to state the output state.

Output State: **`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` contains the next smallest `max_size - 1` elements except the smallest one, `l` is `max_size - 3`, `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 1), max_size`**
