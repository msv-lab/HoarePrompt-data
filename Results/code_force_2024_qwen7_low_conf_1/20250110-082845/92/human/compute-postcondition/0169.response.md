Postcondition: ***`h` and `output` are tuples. If the first element of `h` is greater than or equal to the first element of `output`, `output` remains unchanged (containing the first element of `h` and the integer `1`). Otherwise, `h` is the same heap but with the smallest element removed, and `l` is `original_length - 1`. If `h[0] * l` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, then `output` is updated to `h[0] * l, l`. Otherwise, `output` remains as `h[0] * l, l`.***
