The code `break` does not change any variable values but breaks out of the nearest loop or switch-case structure. Given that there is no loop or switch-case structure in the current context, the only impact is that the program will break out of the implicit loop or switch-case structure it was inside. However, since no such structure is mentioned in the initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `h` is the heap with no elements remaining (i.e., `len(h) == 1`), and `output` is \((h[0], 1)\) if `h[0] >= output[0]\). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
