To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while True` loop.

### Given Conditions:
- `j` is `max_size - 1`
- `max_size` is greater than 0
- `h` contains the smallest `max_size - 1` elements from the list `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for `j` in the range of `max_size - 1`
- `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size` if the length of `h` is not 1, and `output` is `h[0], 1` if the length of `h` is 1

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is `while True`, meaning it will continue to execute as long as there are no explicit conditions to break out of it. Therefore, no state changes are required for the loop to execute one more time because the loop will keep running indefinitely unless explicitly stopped.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute one more time without any additional state adjustments. The current values of `j`, `max_size`, `h`, and `output` remain the same.

### Answer:
State: **`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` contains the smallest `max_size - 1` elements from the list `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for `j` in the range of `max_size - 1`, `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size` if the length of `h` is not 1, and `output` is `h[0], 1` if the length of `h` is 1**
