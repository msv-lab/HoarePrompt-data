Postcondition: **`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` contains the smallest `max_size - 1` elements from the list `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for `j` in the range of `max_size - 1`, `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size` if the length of `h` is not 1, and `output` is `h[0], 1` if the length of `h` is 1.**
