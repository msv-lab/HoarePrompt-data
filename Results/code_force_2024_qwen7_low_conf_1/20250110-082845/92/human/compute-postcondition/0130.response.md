Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(max_size):`, so the variables involved are `j` and `max_size`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j < max_size`. Given that `j` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `j` is less than `max_size`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `j` is initially 0.
   - `max_size` is calculated as `(n + 2) // 2`.
   - `h` is an empty list.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `v` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `p` is a list of integers from the input.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0, it will be less than `max_size` as long as `max_size` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_size` is at least 1 to guarantee the loop can execute.

5. **Formulate the Final State**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `max_size` must be at least 1.
   - The other variables (`h`, `t`, `n`, `v`, `p`) do not affect the initial condition of the loop execution directly.

So, the necessary adjustment for the loop to execute is that `max_size` must be at least 1.

**State: **`j` is 0, `max_size` must be at least 1**
