Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is adjusted based on the condition (either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\)). If the length of heap `h` is 1, `output` is `(h[0], 1)` and the execution is terminated. Otherwise, `h` has one less element than before (the smallest element has been removed) with the addition of `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, `j` is either 0 or `max_size - 1`, `output` is equal to `h[0] * l`, where `l` is a value such that `h[0] * l >= output[0]` if possible, and the new root of the heap (`h[0]`) is larger or smaller than the value at `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`.***
