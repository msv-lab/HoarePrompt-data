The code `heapq.heappop(h)` pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Before this operation, `h` contains the remaining elements of the original list of smallest `max_size - 1` elements after removing the smallest one.

Given the conditions in the initial state:
- `j` is `max_size - 1`
- `max_size` is greater than 0
- `h` is the remaining elements of the original list of smallest `max_size - 1` elements after removing the smallest one
- If the length of `h` was 1, `output` is `None, 1`, else `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size`
- `l` is the length of `h`

After executing `heapq.heappop(h)`, the smallest element from `h` is removed. This affects the value of `h` and potentially the value of `l`.

Let's consider two cases based on the initial length of `h`:

1. If `l` (the length of `h`) was initially 1:
   - `output` would be `None, 1`
   - After popping the only element, `h` becomes an empty list, and `l` becomes 0.
   - The updated `output` would be `None, 1`.

2. If `l` was greater than 1:
   - `output` would be `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size`
   - After popping the smallest element, `h` loses its smallest element, reducing `l` by 1.
   - The updated `output` would be `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size` (unchanged since `h[0]` remains the new smallest element).

Since we don't know the exact initial length of `h`, we can express the general case:

- `j` remains `max_size - 1`
- `max_size` remains greater than 0
- `h` loses its smallest element, making `l` decrease by 1.
- `output` remains unchanged unless `l` was initially 1, in which case it becomes `None, 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` is the remaining elements of the original list after removing the smallest one, `l` is the length of `h` - 1, and `output` is `None, 1` if `l` was 1, otherwise `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size`.**
