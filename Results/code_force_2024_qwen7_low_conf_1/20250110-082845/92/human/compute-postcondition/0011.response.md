Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is `v_sorted[0]`, `min_mushrooms` is `1`, `i` is `1`, `strength` is `v_sorted[0]`. Since the if condition `strength == max_strength` is met, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
