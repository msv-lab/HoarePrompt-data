The code `heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Given the initial state, the smallest element in `h` is smaller than `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`.

- `j` is initially \(\frac{n}{2}\).
- `max_size` is initially \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\).
- `h` is a heap with the smallest element removed, so the new length of `h` is `length(h) - 1`.
- `l` is equal to `length(h) - 1`.
- `output` is the tuple \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{smallest element in } h, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\).

After executing `heapq.heappop(h)`, the smallest element is popped from `h`, and the `output` tuple is updated with this smallest element.

The output state after the code execution is:
- `j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\).
- `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\).
- `h` is a heap with one less element than before, and its smallest element has been popped.
- `l` is `length(h) - 1`.
- `output` is updated to \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{smallest element in } h, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\), where the smallest element in `h` is now the new smallest element after the pop operation.

Output State: **`j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `h` is a heap with one less element than before and its smallest element has been popped, `l` is `length(h) - 1`, `output` is \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{smallest element in } h, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\)**.
