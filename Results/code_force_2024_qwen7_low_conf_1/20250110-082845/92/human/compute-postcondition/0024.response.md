`min_mushrooms` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value (2) and the value of `i` (3). Since 2 is less than 3, `min_mushrooms` remains 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is the maximum between `2 * v_sorted[1]` and `v_sorted[0]`, `min_mushrooms` is 2, `i` is 3, `strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`**
