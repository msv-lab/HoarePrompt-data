`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` contains the smallest element from the list `v[p[n - 1] - 1]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
