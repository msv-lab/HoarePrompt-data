Postcondition: ***`h` and `output` are tuples. If the first element of `h` is greater than or equal to the first element of `output`, then `output` remains unchanged (containing the first element of `h` and the integer `1`). Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition being false.***
