`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Given the initial state, `h` contains the smallest `max_size - 1` elements from the list `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for `j` in the range of `max_size - 1`.

Since `h` is a heap, the smallest element is popped, which means the new smallest element in `h` will be the second smallest element from the original list of `max_size - 1` smallest elements. This impacts the value of `h[0]`, which is now the second smallest element.

- If the length of `h` was 1 before popping, it becomes 0. According to the initial state, if the length of `h` is 1, `output` is set to `h[0], 1`. After popping, the length of `h` is 0, so `output` will be `None, 1`.
- If the length of `h` was more than 1, it becomes `max_size - 2`. According to the initial state, if the length of `h` is not 1, `output` is set to `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size`. After popping, the length of `h` is `max_size - 2`, so `output` will be `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size`.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the length of `h` after the pop operation:
- If the length of `h` was 1, `output` is `None, 1`.
- If the length of `h` was more than 1, `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size`.

Given these considerations, we need to account for both cases:

Output State: **`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` is the remaining elements of the original list of smallest `max_size - 1` elements after removing the smallest one, if the length of `h` was 1, `output` is `None, 1`, else `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size`**
