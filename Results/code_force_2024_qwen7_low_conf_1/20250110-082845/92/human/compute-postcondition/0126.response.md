`p` is assigned the values from the input, converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `p` now holds a list of integers separated by spaces in the input. The other variables (`j`, `max_size`, `h`, `t`, `n`, and `v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `max_size` is greater than 0; `h` is the smallest element from the list `v[p[n - 1] - 1]`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `v` is a list of integers obtained from input; `p` is a list of integers from the input.**
