`heapq.heappush(h, v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1])` pushes the value of `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` onto the heap `h`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so `p[n - 1 - j]` becomes `p[n - 1 - 1]` which simplifies to `p[n - 2]`. Thus, the code pushes `v[p[n - 2] - 1]` onto the heap `h`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `max_size` must be at least 1, `h` contains one additional element `v[p[n - 2] - 1]`**
