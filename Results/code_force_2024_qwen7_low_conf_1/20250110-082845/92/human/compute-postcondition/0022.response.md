`max_strength` is updated to be equal to `strength`. The previous value of `max_strength` was the maximum between `2 * v_sorted[1]` and `v_sorted[0]`. Now, `max_strength` is set to `3 * v_sorted[2]`, which is the new value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`, `min_mushrooms` is 2, `i` is 3, `strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`**
