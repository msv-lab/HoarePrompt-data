`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. The initial state indicates that `h` has more than one element since its length is greater than 1. The output of `heapq.heappop(h)` is the smallest element in `h`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\), the length of `h` is now greater than 0 (since one element was removed), and `output` is not \((h[0], 1)\)**
