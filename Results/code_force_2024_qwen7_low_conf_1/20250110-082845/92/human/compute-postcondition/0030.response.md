Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, a list of positive integers `v`, and a permutation `p` of numbers from 1 to `n`. It first sorts the list `v` in descending order. Then, it iterates through the indices from 1 to `n`, calculating the product of each index `i` and the corresponding value from the sorted list `v_sorted`. The function identifies the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` and records the smallest index `i` that achieves this maximum value. Finally, the function returns two values: the maximum strength and the minimum mushrooms index. The function handles all potential edge cases, such as when `n` is 1 or when all elements in `v` are the same.**
