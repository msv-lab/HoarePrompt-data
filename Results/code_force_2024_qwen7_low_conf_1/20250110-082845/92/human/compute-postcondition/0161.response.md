The code `break` is executed, which breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside, but since no loop or if statement was specified in the initial state, the variables `h` and `output` remain unchanged. The `break` statement does not affect the values of these variables.

Output State: **`h` and `output` are tuples; if the first element of `h` is greater than or equal to the first element of `output`, then `output` remains unchanged (containing the first element of `h` and the integer `1`).**
