The `heapq.heapify(h)` function transforms the list `h` into a heap, which is a binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes. However, since `h` is initially an empty list, heapifying it does not change its state. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2; `h` is an empty list; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `v` is a list of integers obtained from input; `p` is a list of integers from the input.**
