The code updates the value of `max_size` to `(n + 2) // 2`. The value of `n` is an input integer, so the exact value of `max_size` cannot be determined without knowing `n`. However, we know that `max_size` is now set to half of `n + 2`, rounded down to the nearest integer, and that `max_size` is greater than 0 as per the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2; `h` is the smallest element from the list `v[p[n - 1] - 1]`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `v` is a list of integers obtained from input; `p` is a list of integers from the input.**
