The code `heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. This operation affects the heap `h` by removing its smallest element, which was already the smallest before this operation, and updates the heap property.

Given the initial state:
- `h` is the same heap but with the smallest element removed.
- `l` is `original_length - 1`.

Since `heapq.heappop(h)` is called, the smallest element from `h` is removed. After the operation, `h` will no longer contain that smallest element.

Output State: **`h` is the same heap but without the previously smallest element; `l` is `original_length - 1`**
