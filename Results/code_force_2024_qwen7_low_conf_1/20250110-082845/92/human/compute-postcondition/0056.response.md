Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\), the length of `h` is one less than its original length, `output` is not \((h[0], 1)\), `l` is the length of `h` - 1, `h` is now a heap with one more element if `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]`. Otherwise, the length of `h` remains unchanged, and `h` is still a heap.***
