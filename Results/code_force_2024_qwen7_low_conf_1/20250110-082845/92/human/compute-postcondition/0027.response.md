Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range [1, n], `min_mushrooms` is the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`, `i` is `n`, `strength` is `n * v_sorted[n - 1]` if the loop executes `n` times, otherwise `strength` is the last calculated strength value.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration, it calculates `strength = i * v_sorted[i - 1]`.
- The loop updates `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms` based on the value of `strength`.
- After all iterations, `max_strength` will be the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range [1, n].
- `min_mushrooms` will be the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`.
- If the loop executes `n` times, `i` will be `n` and `strength` will be `n * v_sorted[n - 1]`.
- If the loop does not execute `n` times (e.g., due to an early exit condition), `i` will be the last `i` for which the loop did execute, and `strength` will be the last calculated value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`.
