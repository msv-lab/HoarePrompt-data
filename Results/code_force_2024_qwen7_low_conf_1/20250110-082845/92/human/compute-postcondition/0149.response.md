The code `l = len(h)` calculates the length of the list `h` and assigns it to the variable `l`. The length of `h` is already given as `length(h) - 1`, and since no other operations affect the list `h` or the other variables, the output state will include the updated value of `l`.

Output State: **`j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `h` is a heap with the smallest element removed, the length of `h` is `length(h) - 1`, `l` is `length(h) - 1`, and `output` is the tuple \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{smallest element in } h, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\)**
