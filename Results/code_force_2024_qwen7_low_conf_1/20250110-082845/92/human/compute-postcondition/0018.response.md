Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is `v_sorted[0]`, `min_mushrooms` is 1, `i` is 2, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`. If `strength` equals `max_strength`, no changes occur.***
