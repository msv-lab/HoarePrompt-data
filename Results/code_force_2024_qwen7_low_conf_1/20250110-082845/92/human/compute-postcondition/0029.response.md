The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `v`, and `p`. 
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `v` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\).
- `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

The function calculates:
- `max_strength`, which is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range [1, n], where `v_sorted` is the sorted version of the list `v`.
- `min_mushrooms`, which is the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a list of positive integers `v`, and a permutation `p` of numbers from 1 to `n`, and return the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` and the smallest `i` for which this maximum value is achieved.
