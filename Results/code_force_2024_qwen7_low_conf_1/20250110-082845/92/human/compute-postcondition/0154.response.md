Postcondition: ***`j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `h` is a heap with either the same number of elements as before (if `h[0] >= v[p[l - 1] - 1]`), or one more element than before (if `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]`), `l` is \(\text{length}(h) - 1\), `output` is \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{new_smallest}, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\) where `new_smallest` is the new smallest element in `h` after the update, and the current value of `h[0] * l` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`***
