According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- `max_strength` is `v_sorted[0]`.
- `min_mushrooms` is 1.
- `i` is 1 (which means this is the first iteration).
- `strength` is `v_sorted[0]`.

The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 2.

Since the loop does not depend on `strength` or `max_strength` to continue executing (as per the given information), we only need to update the value of `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is `v_sorted[0]`, `min_mushrooms` is 1, `i` is 2, `strength` is `v_sorted[0]`.**
