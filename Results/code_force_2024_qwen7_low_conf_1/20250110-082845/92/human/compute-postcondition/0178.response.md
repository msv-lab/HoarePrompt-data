Postcondition: ***`h` does not contain its smallest element, `l` is the length of `h`. If `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, then `h` now contains its smallest element which is `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` and `l` becomes `l - 1`. If `h[0] >= v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, `h` still does not contain its smallest element and `l` remains unchanged.***
