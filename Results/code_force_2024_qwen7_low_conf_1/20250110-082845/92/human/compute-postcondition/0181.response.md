Postcondition: ***`h` is a non-empty list. If the length of `h` is 1, then `output` is a tuple where the first element is the same as the first element of `h`, and the second element is either 1 or remains unchanged based on whether the first element of `h` is greater than or equal to the first element of `output`. Otherwise, `h` does not contain its smallest element, and `l` is decremented by 1 if `h[0] * l` is greater than or equal to `output[0`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.***
