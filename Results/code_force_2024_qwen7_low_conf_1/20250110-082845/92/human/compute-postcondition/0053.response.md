`l` is assigned the value of `len(h)`, which is the length of the list `h`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions state that the length of `h` is greater than 0, so `l` will be a positive integer. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\), the length of `h` is greater than 0, `output` is not \((h[0], 1)\), `l` is the length of `h`**
