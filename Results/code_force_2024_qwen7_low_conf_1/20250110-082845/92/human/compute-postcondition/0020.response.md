Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is a positive integer.
   - \( v_sorted \) is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order.
   - \( p \) is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - \( max_strength \) is the maximum between \( 2 \cdot v_sorted[1] \) and \( v_sorted[0] \).
   - \( min_mushrooms \) is 2.
   - \( i \) is 2.
   - \( strength \) is \( 2 \cdot v_sorted[1] \).
   - If \( strength \) is greater than \( max_strength \), \( max_strength \) is updated to \( strength \). Otherwise, no changes occur.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from \( i = 1 \) to \( i = n \).

3. **Current Value of \( i \):**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) is 2.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( i \) must be less than \( n + 1 \).
   - Since \( i \) is currently 2, the next value of \( i \) will be 3.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - Since the loop condition is \( i < n + 1 \), the loop will execute again if \( i = 3 \).
   - The value of \( i \) will be incremented to 3.
   - No other state changes are explicitly mentioned in the given conditions for the loop itself (assuming no further modifications within the loop body are provided).

6. **Final States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - \( n \) remains the same as it was before.
   - \( v_sorted \) remains the same as it was before.
   - \( p \) remains the same as it was before.
   - \( max_strength \) remains the same as it was before unless the loop body updates it, but no such update is mentioned here.
   - \( min_mushrooms \) remains 2.
   - \( i \) is now 3.
   - \( strength \) remains \( 2 \cdot v_sorted[1] \).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is the maximum between `2 * v_sorted[1]` and `v_sorted[0]`, `min_mushrooms` is 2, `i` is 3, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`.**
