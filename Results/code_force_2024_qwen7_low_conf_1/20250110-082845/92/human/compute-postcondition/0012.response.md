Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is `v_sorted[0]`, `min_mushrooms` is 1, `i` is 1, `strength` is `v_sorted[0]`. Regardless of whether the condition `strength > max_strength` is true or false, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
