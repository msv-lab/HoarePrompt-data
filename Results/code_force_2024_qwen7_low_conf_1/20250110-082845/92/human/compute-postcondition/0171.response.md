The code `output = h[0], 1` assigns the first element of the list `h` to the variable `output` and sets the second element of `output` to `1`. Since `h` is not empty, `h[0]` will be assigned to the first position in `output`, and `1` will be assigned to the second position.

Output State: **`h` is not empty, `output` is a tuple with the first element equal to the first element of `h` and the second element equal to 1**
