According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `max_size`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `max_size`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `max_size` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- `max_size` must remain greater than 0 to allow another iteration.

The state of the variables does not change other than `j` being incremented. Therefore, the only state adjustment needed is for `j`.

State: **`j` is 1, `max_size` must be greater than 0, `h` contains `v[p[n - 1] - 1]`**
