Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is the maximum between `2 * v_sorted[1]` and `v_sorted[0]`, `min_mushrooms` is 2, `i` is 2, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`. If `strength` is greater than `max_strength`, `max_strength` is updated to `strength`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
