Postcondition: ***`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` contains the next smallest `max_size - 1` elements. If `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then `l` is either `max_size - 2` and `output` is updated to `h[0] * (max_size - 1), max_size`, or `l` remains `max_size - 3` and `output` remains unchanged.***
