Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\), and `output` is determined as follows: if the length of `h` is 1, `output` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `output` is \((h[0], 1)\) if `h[0] >= output[0]`. If the length of `h` is greater than 1, `output` is either `h[0] * l, l` if `h[0] * l >= output[0]` holds, or remains unchanged, where `l` is the length of `h`, and `h` is a heap.***
