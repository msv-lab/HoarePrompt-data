According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `max_size` and `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `max_size`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `j` is 0
- `max_size` must be at least 1
- `h` contains one additional element `v[p[n - 1] - 1]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Additionally, `max_size` must remain at least 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` will be incremented to 1
- `max_size` must still be at least 1
- `h` will contain one additional element, which will now be `v[p[n - 1] - 1]` since the loop has not yet modified `h` (the loop body is omitted but typically would add elements based on the loop index)

State: **`j` is 1, `max_size` must be at least 1, `h` contains one additional element `v[p[n - 1] - 1]`**
