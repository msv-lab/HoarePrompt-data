Postcondition: ***`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` is a heap containing `max_size - 2` smallest elements, including the minimum of `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` and `h[0]`, `output` is updated to `h[0] * (max_size - 2)` if `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, `len(h)` is `max_size - 2`, and `l` is `max_size - 2`.***
