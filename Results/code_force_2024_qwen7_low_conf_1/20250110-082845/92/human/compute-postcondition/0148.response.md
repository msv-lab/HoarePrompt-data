`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h[0]` was the smallest element before the operation, it is now removed. The length of `h` is reduced by 1, and the smallest element in `h` may have changed.

The initial state includes:
- `j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\)
- `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\)
- `h` is a heap with one element removed, and its smallest element (which is no longer in the heap) was stored in `h[0]`
- `output` is the tuple \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{smallest element in } h, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\)
- The length of `h` is greater than 1

After executing `heapq.heappop(h)`, the smallest element in `h` is no longer accessible directly via `h[0]`, and the length of `h` is now `length(h) - 1`.

The updated states are:
- `j` remains \(\frac{n}{2}\)
- `max_size` remains \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\)
- `h` is now a heap with the smallest element removed, and the length of `h` is reduced by 1
- `output` remains the same since it does not depend on the current value of `h[0]`

Output State: **`j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `h` is a heap with the smallest element removed, the length of `h` is length(`h`) - 1, and `output` is the tuple \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{smallest element in } h, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\)**
