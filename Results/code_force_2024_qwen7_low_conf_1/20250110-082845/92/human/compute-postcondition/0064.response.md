The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `v`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `t` is greater than 1 (unchanged).
2. `n` is an integer input (unchanged).
3. `max_size` is either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\) (unchanged).
4. `h` is an empty heap (unchanged).
5. `j` is 0 (unchanged).
6. `output` is \(((n + 2) // 2) * h[0]\) (unchanged, since `h[0]` is not defined yet).

After the code executes, `v` will be a list containing the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `n` is an integer input; `max_size` is either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\); `h` is an empty heap; `j` is 0; `output` is \(((n + 2) // 2) * h[0]\); `v` is a list of integers from the input.**
