Postcondition: ***`j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `h` is the heap with no elements remaining (i.e., `len(h) == 1`), and its smallest element was previously stored in `h[0]`. `output` is the tuple \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{smallest element in } h, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\). The current value of `len(h)` is 1.***
