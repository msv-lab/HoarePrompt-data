Postcondition: ***`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` contains the smallest `max_size - 1` elements from the list `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for `j` in the range of `max_size - 1`, `output` is `h[0], 1`, and the length of `h` is 1. If `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition always holds as specified in the if part.***
