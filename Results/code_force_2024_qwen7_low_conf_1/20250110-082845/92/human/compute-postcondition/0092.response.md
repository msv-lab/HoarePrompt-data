Postcondition: ***`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` is a heap containing `max_size - 2` smallest elements, including the minimum of `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` and `h[0]`, `output` is `max_size * h[0]`, `len(h)` is `max_size - 2`, `l` is `max_size - 2`. If the first element of `h` is less than `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, then `h` remains unchanged, and `output` is updated to `max_size * h[0]`. Since there is no else part, the state does not change if the condition is not met.***
