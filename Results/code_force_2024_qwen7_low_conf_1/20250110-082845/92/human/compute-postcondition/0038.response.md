Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is adjusted based on the condition (either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\)), `h` is a heap containing either 1 element or `max_size` elements, `j` is either 0 or `max_size - 1`, `output` is now `(h[0], 1)`, and the new root of the heap (`h[0]`) may be larger or smaller than the value at `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`***
