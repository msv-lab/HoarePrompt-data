Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `max_size` must be at least 1.
   - `h` contains one additional element `v[p[n - 2] - 1]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(max_size):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j < max_size`.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must become 2.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - The condition `max_size` must still be at least 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `max_size` must still be at least 1.
   - The contents of `h` remain unchanged since the loop body is omitted and no operations are mentioned that affect `h`.

Based on this analysis, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`j` is 2, `max_size` must be at least 1, `h` contains one additional element `v[p[n - 2] - 1]`**
