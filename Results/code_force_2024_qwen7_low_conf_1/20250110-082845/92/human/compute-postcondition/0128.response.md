The line `h = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `h`. The previous value of `h` was the smallest element from the list `v[p[n - 1] - 1]`, which is now replaced by an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2; `h` is an empty list; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `v` is a list of integers obtained from input; `p` is a list of integers from the input.**
