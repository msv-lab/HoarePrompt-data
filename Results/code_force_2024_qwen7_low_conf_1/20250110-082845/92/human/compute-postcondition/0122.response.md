The code `print(output[0], output[1])` prints the values of `output[0]` and `output[1]` without changing any variable values. Therefore, the values of `output[0]` and `output[1]` remain the same as their values in the initial state.

In the initial state:
- `j` is 0
- `max_size` is greater than 0
- `h` contains the smallest element from the list `v[p[n - 1] - 1]`
- `output` is `h[0], 1` if the length of `h` is 1, and `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 1), max_size` if the length of `h` is greater than 1 and this value is greater than or equal to the previous `output[0]`.

Since the code only prints these values, the output state remains the same as the initial state regarding `output`.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` contains the smallest element from the list `v[p[n - 1] - 1]`, `output` is `h[0], 1` if the length of `h` is 1, and `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 1), max_size` if the length of `h` is greater than 1 and this value is greater than or equal to the previous `output[0]`. The values of `output[0]` and `output[1]` are printed.**
