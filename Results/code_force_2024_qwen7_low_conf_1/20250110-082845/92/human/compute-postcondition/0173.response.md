The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `h` and `output`. It simply exits the current loop or block of code. Therefore, the values of `h` and `output` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`h` is not empty, `output` is a tuple with the first element equal to the first element of `h`. If the first element of `h` is greater than or equal to the first element of `output`, then the second element of `output` remains 1.**
