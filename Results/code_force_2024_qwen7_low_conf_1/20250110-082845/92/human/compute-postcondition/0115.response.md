`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Given that `h` contains the next smallest `max_size - 2` elements, the smallest element in `h` is removed. The value of `j` is `max_size - 1`, which is unaffected. The value of `max_size` remains greater than 0. The variable `l` is the length of `h` before the pop operation, and it decreases by 1. The value of `output` depends on the condition `len(h) == 0` or `h[0] * (max_size - 1), max_size` if the condition is met. Since `h` had `max_size - 2` elements, after removing the smallest element, `len(h)` is now `max_size - 3`, which is not zero. Thus, the value of `output` is updated to `h[0] * (max_size - 1), max_size`.

Output State: **`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` contains the next smallest `max_size - 2` elements except the smallest one, `l` is `max_size - 3`, `output` is `h[0] * (max_size - 1), max_size`**
