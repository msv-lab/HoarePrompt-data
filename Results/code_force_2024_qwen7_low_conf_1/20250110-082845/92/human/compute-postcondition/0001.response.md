The code initializes `max_strength` to 0, but does not perform any operations that affect the values of `n`, `v_sorted`, or `p`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order; `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n; `max_strength` is 0.**
