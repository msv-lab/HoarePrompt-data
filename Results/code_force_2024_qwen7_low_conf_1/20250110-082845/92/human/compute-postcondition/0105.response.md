Postcondition: ***`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` is the remaining elements of the original list of smallest `max_size - 1` elements after removing the smallest one, `l` is the length of `h`, and `output` is `None, 1` if `l` is 1, otherwise `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size`. If `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, `output` is updated to `h[0] * (max_size - 2), max_size`. If `h[0] >= v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, `output` remains unchanged.***
