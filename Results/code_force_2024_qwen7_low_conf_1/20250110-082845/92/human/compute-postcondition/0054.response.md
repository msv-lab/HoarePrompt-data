`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. This operation affects the variable `h` by reducing its size and changing its contents, but the length of `h` (`l`) will decrease by one. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\), the length of `h` is one less than its original length, `output` is not \((h[0], 1)\), `l` is the length of `h` - 1**
