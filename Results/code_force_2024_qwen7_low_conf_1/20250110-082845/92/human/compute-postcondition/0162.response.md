`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. The state of `h` changes, but without knowing the exact contents of `h`, we can only say that the smallest element has been removed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is the same heap but with the smallest element removed**
