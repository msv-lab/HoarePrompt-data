The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the execution is terminated at this point. All the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is adjusted based on the condition (either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\)), `h` is a heap containing either 1 element or `max_size` elements, `j` is either 0 or `max_size - 1`, `output` is now `(h[0], 1)`, and the new root of the heap (`h[0]`) may be larger or smaller than the value at `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`. Execution is terminated.**
