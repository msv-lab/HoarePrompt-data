The code `l = len(h)` calculates the length of the list `h` and assigns it to the variable `l`. Since `h` does not contain its smallest element, this fact remains unchanged. The length of the list `h` is stored in `l`.

Output State: **`h` does not contain its smallest element; `l` is the length of `h`**
