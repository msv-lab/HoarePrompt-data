The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each to an integer, and assigns them to the list `p`. This impacts the variable `p`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `n` is an integer input
- `max_size` is either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\)
- `h` is an empty heap
- `j` is 0
- `output` is \(((n + 2) // 2) * h[0]\)
- `v` is a list of integers from the input

After the code execution:
- `p` is updated to the list of integers from the input
- The other variables remain unchanged

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 1; `n` is an integer input; `max_size` is either \((n + 2) // 2\) or \((n + 2) // 2 - 1\); `h` is an empty heap; `j` is 0; `output` is \(((n + 2) // 2) * h[0]\); `v` is a list of integers from the input; `p` is the list of integers from the input.**
