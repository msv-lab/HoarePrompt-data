Postcondition: ***`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` is the remaining elements of the original list of smallest `max_size - 1` elements after removing the smallest one, `l` is the length of `h`. If `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, `output` is updated to `h[0] * l, l`. Otherwise, `output` remains unchanged.***
