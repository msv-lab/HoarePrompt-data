Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `max_size` is `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, `h` is a heap containing exactly `max_size` elements, `j` is `max_size - 1`, `output` is `((n + 2) // 2) * h[0], ((n + 2) // 2) - 1, len(h)` is now `max_size`, and the new root of the heap (`h[0]`) may be larger or smaller than the value at `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`.*** 

Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition remains the same as the postcondition of the if part. The only difference is the comparison of `h[0]` with `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, which is considered in the if condition.
