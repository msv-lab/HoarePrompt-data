The code `heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. This operation affects the `h` variable, reducing its size by one. Since `h` originally contained the smallest `max_size - 1` elements, after removing the smallest element, `h` now contains the next smallest `max_size - 2` elements.

The `output` variable is only affected if `len(h) == 1` or `len(h) > 1`. Given the initial state and the nature of `heapq.heappop`, we consider the two cases:

1. If `len(h) == 1` before the operation, after `heappop`, `len(h)` becomes 0. So `output` remains unchanged.
2. If `len(h) > 1` before the operation, after `heappop`, `len(h)` becomes `max_size - 2`. We then compare `h[0] * (max_size - 1)` with `output[0]` to decide whether to update `output`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `h[0]` and `output[0]`, we'll keep them as symbolic representations. However, we know the following:
- `j` is `max_size - 1`
- `max_size` is greater than 0
- `h` initially contained the smallest `max_size - 1` elements
- `output` is defined based on the condition of `len(h)`

Given these points, the `heapq.heappop(h)` operation removes the smallest element from `h`, and `output` might be updated if `len(h) > 1` after the pop.

Output State: **`j` is `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is greater than 0, `h` contains the next smallest `max_size - 2` elements, `output` remains unchanged if `len(h) == 0` or is updated to `h[0] * (max_size - 1), max_size` if `h[0] * (max_size - 1) >= output[0]`**
