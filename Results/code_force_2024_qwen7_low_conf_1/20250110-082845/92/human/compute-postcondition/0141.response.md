According to the code, this is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will always execute at least once. There are no conditions that need to be checked to determine whether the loop should continue executing. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\); `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\); `h` is the heap with one element removed, and its smallest element is stored in `h[0]`; `output` is the tuple \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{smallest element in } h, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\)**
