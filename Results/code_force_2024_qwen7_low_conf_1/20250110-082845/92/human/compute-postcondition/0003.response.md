Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order.
   - `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - `max_strength` is 0.
   - `min_mushrooms` is `n`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, but the range function in Python generates values from 1 to `n` inclusive. This means the loop will iterate `n` times, starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute correctly, the variable `i` must start at 1 and increment up to `n`.
   - There are no additional constraints on `v_sorted`, `p`, `max_strength`, or `min_mushrooms` for the loop to execute. These variables will be updated inside the loop based on its operations.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should start at 1.

The final state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is 0, `min_mushrooms` is n, `i` is 1**
