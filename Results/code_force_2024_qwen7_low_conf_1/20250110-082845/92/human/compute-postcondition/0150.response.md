Postcondition: **`j` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), `max_size` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `h` is a heap with the smallest element removed and the length of `h` is `length(h) - 1`, `l` is `length(h) - 1`, `output` is the tuple \(\left( \left( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right) \times \text{smallest element in } h, \frac{n}{2} - 1 \right)\). The current value of the first element of `h` is smaller than `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`**
