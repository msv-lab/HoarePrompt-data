#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, v is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
def func_1(n, v, p):
    v_sorted = sorted(v, reverse=True)
    max_strength = 0
    min_mushrooms = n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        strength = i * v_sorted[i - 1]
        
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            min_mushrooms = i

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `max_strength` is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range [1, n], `min_mushrooms` is the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`, `i` is `n`, `strength` is `n * v_sorted[n - 1]` if the loop executes `n` times, otherwise `strength` is the last calculated strength value.
    return max_strength, min_mushrooms
    #`max_strength` is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range [1, n], `min_mushrooms` is the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, a list of positive integers `v`, and a permutation `p` of numbers from 1 to `n`. It first sorts the list `v` in descending order. Then, it iterates through the indices from 1 to `n`, calculating the product of each index `i` and the corresponding value from the sorted list `v_sorted`. The function identifies the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` and records the smallest index `i` that achieves this maximum value. Finally, the function returns two values: the maximum strength and the minimum mushrooms index. The function handles all potential edge cases, such as when `n` is 1 or when all elements in `v` are the same.
