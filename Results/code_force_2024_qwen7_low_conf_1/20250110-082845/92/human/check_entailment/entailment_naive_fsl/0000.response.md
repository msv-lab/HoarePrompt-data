Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the permutation `p` causes some mushrooms to have their magic power reduced to zero. Specifically, the program sorts the mushrooms' magic powers in descending order and selects the top `i` mushrooms, assuming that the magic powers remain unchanged. However, the permutation `p` can cause some mushrooms' magic powers to become zero, which the current implementation does not account for.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3
9 8 14
3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
16 2
```

However, the actual output of the provided program would be:
```
24 2
```

This is because the program does not consider the effect of the permutation `p` on the magic powers of the mushrooms. It simply sorts the magic powers and takes the top `i` mushrooms without checking if their magic powers will be zero due to the permutation.

To fix this, the program needs to dynamically check the effective magic powers of the mushrooms after applying the permutation `p`. This involves maintaining a dynamic set of effective magic powers and updating it as mushrooms are picked, considering the permutation.
