You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
As soon as everyone in the camp fell asleep, Kirill sneaked out of the tent
and went to the Wise Oak to gather mushrooms.

It is known that there are n mushrooms growing under the Oak, each of which
has magic power v_i . Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum
strength from the mushrooms.

The strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms
in it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the
elixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.
Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order.

However, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation
of numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic
power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .
Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.

Your task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew
the elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to
stay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for
gathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of
mushrooms.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n different integers from
1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a
permutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
200\,000 ) — the number of mushrooms.

The second line contains an array v of size n (1\le v_i \le 10^9 ) — the magic
powers of the mushrooms.

The third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two integers separated by a space — the maximum
strength of the elixir that can be brewed and the minimum number of mushrooms
that Kirill needs to use for this.

Note

In the first example, you need to take the mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 , so
the strength of the elixir is equal to 2 \cdot \min(a_1, a_2) = 2 \cdot
\min(9, 8) = 2 \cdot 8 = 16 . Note that the magic power of the mushroom with
index 3 after picking two mushrooms will become 0 .

    return max_strength, min_mushrooms
    #`max_strength` is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` in the range [1, n], `min_mushrooms` is the smallest `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the permutation `p` causes some mushrooms to have their magic power reduced to zero. Specifically, the program sorts the mushrooms' magic powers in descending order and selects the top `i` mushrooms, assuming that the magic powers remain unchanged. However, the permutation `p` can cause some mushrooms' magic powers to become zero, which the current implementation does not account for.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3
9 8 14
3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
16 2
```

However, the actual output of the provided program would be:
```
24 2
```

This is because the program does not consider the effect of the permutation `p` on the magic powers of the mushrooms. It simply sorts the magic powers and takes the top `i` mushrooms without checking if their magic powers will be zero due to the permutation.

To fix this, the program needs to dynamically check the effective magic powers of the mushrooms after applying the permutation `p`. This involves maintaining a dynamic set of effective magic powers and updating it as mushrooms are picked, considering the permutation.
