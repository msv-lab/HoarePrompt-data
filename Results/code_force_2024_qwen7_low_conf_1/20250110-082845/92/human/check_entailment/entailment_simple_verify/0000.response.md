### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement more closely.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- Kirill needs to gather mushrooms to maximize the elixir strength, which is defined as the product of the number of mushrooms and the minimum magic power among them.
- The magic power of mushrooms can change due to a permutation `p` where some mushrooms will have their magic power reduced to zero if they are picked.

#### Given Code:
The program sorts the mushrooms' magic powers in descending order and selects the top `i` mushrooms. However, this approach does not account for the permutation `p` which can render some mushrooms' magic power zero.

#### Annotated Code:
```python
def func_1(n, v, p):
    v_sorted = sorted(v, reverse=True)
    max_strength = 0
    min_mushrooms = n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        strength = i * v_sorted[i - 1]
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            min_mushrooms = i
        elif strength == max_strength:
            min_mushrooms = min(min_mushrooms, i)
    return max_strength, min_mushrooms
```

The function `func_1` sorts the magic powers of the mushrooms and iterates through the sorted list to determine the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms required to achieve this strength. However, this method ignores the permutation `p` and the possibility that some mushrooms might have their magic power reduced to zero.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the test case:
```
3
9 8 14
3 2 1
```
- The sorted magic powers are `[14, 9, 8]`.
- The program will consider the first two mushrooms: `14 * 1 = 14` and `9 * 2 = 18`.

However, according to the permutation `p = [3, 2, 1]`, the first mushroom (with index 1) will have its magic power reduced to zero, and the second mushroom (with index 2) will have its magic power reduced to zero after the first mushroom is picked. Thus, the actual effective magic power for the first mushroom is `0`, and for the second mushroom is also `0`. Therefore, the correct solution should only consider the first mushroom, giving a strength of `1 * 14 = 14`.

The program does not handle this scenario correctly. It should instead maintain a dynamic set of effective magic powers and update it as mushrooms are picked, considering the permutation `p`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the permutation `p` causes some mushrooms to have their magic power reduced to zero.

**Final: False**
