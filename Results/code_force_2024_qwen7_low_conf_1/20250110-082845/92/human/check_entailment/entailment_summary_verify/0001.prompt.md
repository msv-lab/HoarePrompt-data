You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
As soon as everyone in the camp fell asleep, Kirill sneaked out of the tent
and went to the Wise Oak to gather mushrooms.

It is known that there are n mushrooms growing under the Oak, each of which
has magic power v_i . Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum
strength from the mushrooms.

The strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms
in it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the
elixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.
Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order.

However, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation
of numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic
power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .
Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.

Your task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew
the elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to
stay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for
gathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of
mushrooms.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n different integers from
1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a
permutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
200\,000 ) — the number of mushrooms.

The second line contains an array v of size n (1\le v_i \le 10^9 ) — the magic
powers of the mushrooms.

The third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two integers separated by a space — the maximum
strength of the elixir that can be brewed and the minimum number of mushrooms
that Kirill needs to use for this.

Note

In the first example, you need to take the mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 , so
the strength of the elixir is equal to 2 \cdot \min(a_1, a_2) = 2 \cdot
\min(9, 8) = 2 \cdot 8 = 16 . Note that the magic power of the mushroom with
index 3 after picking two mushrooms will become 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, v, p)
    print(*result)

def func_1(n, v, p):
    v_sorted = sorted(v, reverse=True)
    max_strength = 0
    min_mushrooms = n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        strength = i * v_sorted[i - 1]
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            min_mushrooms = i
        elif strength == max_strength:
            min_mushrooms = min(min_mushrooms, i)
    return (max_strength, min_mushrooms)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, a list of positive integers `v`, and a permutation `p` of numbers from 1 to `n`. It first sorts the list `v` in descending order. Then, it iterates through the indices from 1 to `n`, calculating the product of each index `i` and the corresponding value from the sorted list `v_sorted`. The function identifies the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` and records the smallest index `i` that achieves this maximum value. Finally, the function returns two values: the maximum strength and the minimum mushrooms index. The function handles all potential edge cases, such as when `n` is 1 or when all elements in `v` are the same.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem**: The task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that the strength of the elixir is maximized while using the minimum number of mushrooms. The strength is calculated as the product of the number of mushrooms and the minimum magic power among them. The program must correctly compute this for each test case.

2. **Analyze the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of mushrooms `n`, their magic powers `v`, and a permutation `p`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to determine the maximum strength and minimum number of mushrooms needed.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - It sorts the magic powers in descending order.
   - It iterates through the first `i` elements of the sorted list and calculates the potential strength as `i * v_sorted[i-1]`.
   - It updates the maximum strength and the corresponding minimum number of mushrooms required if a new maximum strength is found.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct in that it checks each possible number of mushrooms (from 1 to n) and calculates the potential strength.
   - It keeps track of the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms required to achieve that strength.
   - The sorting step ensures that the minimum magic power is always the last element in the sorted list, simplifying the calculation of the product.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where multiple sets of mushrooms could give the same maximum strength, choosing the set with the minimum number of mushrooms.
   - The input constraints (up to \(2 \times 10^5\) mushrooms per test case) are handled within the time limits.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.
