Reasoning:
- The program correctly defines the function `func_1` to calculate the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms needed.
- The function first sorts the list `v` in descending order, ensuring that the minimum magic power is always the last element in the sorted list.
- It then iterates through the indices from 1 to `n`, calculating the product of the index and the corresponding value from the sorted list. This product represents the strength of the elixir if Kirill picks exactly `i` mushrooms.
- The function keeps track of the maximum strength found and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve this maximum strength.
- The logic in the function appears to be sound and should handle all edge cases, including when `n` is 1 or when all elements in `v` are the same.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
