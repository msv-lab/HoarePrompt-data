Reasoning:
1. The function correctly processes each test case by reading the number of programmers `n` and testers `m`, followed by the programming skills `a` and testing skills `b` for each candidate.
2. It then determines the optimal hiring sequence by iterating through each candidate and deciding whether they are hired as a programmer (`0`) or a tester (`1`), based on their skills.
3. During this process, it maintains the counts of hired programmers and testers and accumulates the skill sums accordingly.
4. The function identifies a "bad" candidate who, if excluded, requires special handling due to their position in the hiring sequence.
5. After processing all candidates, it calculates the skill sum for the team when excluding each candidate one by one.
6. Special adjustments are made if the "bad" candidate is among those excluded, ensuring the skill sum reflects the correct hiring sequence.
7. Finally, the results are printed in the required format.

Given the detailed logic and the steps involved, the provided implementation accurately follows the problem statement and handles all edge cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
