`val` is assigned the value of `ans - a[types[i]][i]`. The value of `val` depends on the values of `ans` and `a[types[i]][i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `bad` is unchanged, `types` is unchanged, `badType` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `res` contains the previous elements plus the value of `val` and `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i]`**
