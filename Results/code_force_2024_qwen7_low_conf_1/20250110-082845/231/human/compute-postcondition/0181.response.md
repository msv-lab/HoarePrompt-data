The code assigns the value of `i` to `bad`. This does not affect the values of `curType`, `n`, `m`, `i_val`, `a[0][i_val]`, `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]`, `types[i + 1]`, or `ans`. Therefore, the only change is that `bad` now holds the value of `i`.

Output State: **`curType` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1, `types[i + 1]` is equal to `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`, `bad` is equal to `i`.**
