`cur[types[i]]` is assigned the value of `cur[types[i]] + 1`. Given that `types[i]` is equal to `curType`, `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`curType` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, and `cur[curType]` does not change; `types[i]` is equal to `curType`; `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`; `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1.**
