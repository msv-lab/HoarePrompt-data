Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `i` is `n + m`
  - `curType` is the same
  - `cur[curType]` is the same
  - `bad` is the same
  - `badType` is the same
  - `types` is the same
  - `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1]` is the same
  - `val` is either `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[types[n + m]][n + m]` or `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` depending on the conditions
  - `res` is a list of length `n + m + 1` containing the value of `ans` appended to the previous list
  - `print(*res)` is executed

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop is controlled by the input to `range(int(input()))`.
- This means the loop will execute for as many times as the integer input provided by the user.
- Since we don't know the exact number of iterations from the provided information, let's denote the number of remaining iterations as `k`.

### State Adjustments:
- The only thing that changes with each iteration of the loop is the input value provided by `int(input())`.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be updated based on the input value.

### Conclusion:
To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the loop condition is met. In this case, the loop condition is based on the input value, which is provided by `int(input())`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is the new value of `int(input())`, `curType` is the same, `cur[curType]` is the same, `bad` is the same, `badType` is the same, `types` is the same, `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1]` is the same, `val` is either `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[types[n + m]][n + m]` or `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` depending on the conditions, `res` is a list of length `n + m + 1` containing the value of `ans` appended to the previous list, and `print(*res)` is executed.**

Note: The specific value of `i` will depend on the input provided by the user during the next iteration.
