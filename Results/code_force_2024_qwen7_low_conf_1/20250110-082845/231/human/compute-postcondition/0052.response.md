According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `n + m` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `res` is an empty list, but this alone does not determine if the loop will execute. We need to ensure that the condition `n + m > 0` is satisfied.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n + m - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n + m` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial value of `res` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are to ensure that `n + m` is greater than 0.

State: **`res` is an empty list, `n + m` must be greater than 0**
