The code `bad = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `bad`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 1, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` equals 1, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is equal to `curType`, and `ans` is `a[curType][0]`.**
