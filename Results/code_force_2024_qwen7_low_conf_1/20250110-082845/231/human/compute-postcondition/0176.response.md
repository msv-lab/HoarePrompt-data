According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `curType` is 0,
- `n` is a non-negative integer,
- `m` is a non-negative integer,
- `n + m` is greater than 0,
- `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive,
- `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`,
- `cur[curType]` does not change,
- `types[i]` is equal to `curType`,
- `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`,
- `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the value it was before the increment plus 1.

Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust:
- `i` should be `i + 1`.
- `cur[curType]` should be incremented by 1 (as given in the loop body).
- `ans` should be increased by `a[0][i_val]` (as given in the loop body).

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 and the other conditions remain the same, we update the state accordingly.

State: **`curType` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1, `types[i + 1]` is equal to `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`**.
