The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `curType` is 0 or 1
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `n + m` is greater than 0
- `i_val` is `n + m`
- `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`
- `cur[curType]` is updated based on the previous increment and switch condition
- `types[i]` is equal to `curType`
- `types[i + 1]` is equal to the new `curType`
- `ans` is increased by `a[curType][i_val] + a[types[i]][i]`
- if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is switched to the other type
- if `bad` is -1, then `bad` is set to `i` and `badType` is 1 - `curType`

After the code execution, the only variable that changes is `cur[types[i]]`. It is incremented by 1. All other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`curType` is 0 or 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is `n + m`, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1, `cur[curType]` is updated based on the previous increment and switch condition, `types[i]` is equal to `curType`, `types[i + 1]` is equal to the new `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[curType][i_val] + a[types[i]][i]`, if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is switched to the other type, if `bad` is -1, then `bad` is set to `i` and `badType` is 1 - `curType`.**
