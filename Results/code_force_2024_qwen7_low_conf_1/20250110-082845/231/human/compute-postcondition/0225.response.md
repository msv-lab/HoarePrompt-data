Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
- For each test case, \( n \) and \( m \) are integers such that \( 0 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 2 \leq n + m + 1 \leq 2 \times 10^5 \).
- \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are sequences of integers where \( 1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9 \) and \( a_i \neq b_i \) for all \( i \).

### Loop Code Analysis:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    bounds = [n, m]
    a = []
    a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
    bad = -1
    badType = -1
    cur = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    types = [(0) for i in range(n + m + 1)]
    for i in range(n + m):
        curType = 0
        if a[0][i] < a[1][i]:
            curType = 1
        if cur[curType] == bounds[curType]:
            curType = 1 - curType
            if bad == -1:
                bad = i
                badType = 1 - curType
        types[i] = curType
        ans += a[types[i]][i]
        cur[types[i]] += 1
    res = []
    for i in range(n + m):
        val = ans - a[types[i]][i]
        if bad != -1 and i < bad and types[i] == badType:
            val = val + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]
        else:
            val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]
        res.append(val)
    res.append(ans)
    print(*res)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - \( t \) remains constant.
   - \( n \) and \( m \) are read and remain unchanged after the loop.
   - \( a \) contains two lists of integers.
   - \( bounds \), \( cur \), \( ans \), and \( types \) are initialized.
   - \( bad \) and \( badType \) are set to -1 initially.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from \( i = 0 \) to \( i = n + m - 1 \).
   - \( curType \) is determined based on the comparison of elements in \( a[0] \) and \( a[1] \).
   - \( cur[curType] \) is updated if it reaches its bound.
   - \( bad \) and \( badType \) are set if necessary.
   - \( ans \) is accumulated based on the chosen elements.
   - \( types \) array keeps track of the selected type.
   - After the loop, \( res \) is constructed and printed.

### Final Output State:

After the loop has executed, the following will be true:
- \( t \) remains the same.
- \( n \) and \( m \) remain the same.
- \( a \) remains unchanged.
- \( bad \) and \( badType \) remain the same.
- \( types \) contains the sequence of choices made during the loop.
- \( ans \) is the sum of selected elements from \( a \) based on the loop logic.
- \( res \) is a list of length \( n + m + 1 \) containing the values of \( val \) for each iteration and the final \( ans \).

### Conclusion:
Output State: **\( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), \( n \) and \( m \) are integers such that \( 0 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 2 \leq n + m + 1 \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), \( a \) is a list of two lists of integers, \( bad \) and \( badType \) are integers, \( types \) is a list of integers, \( ans \) is the sum of selected elements from \( a \) based on the loop logic, \( res \) is a list of length \( n + m + 1 \) containing the values of \( val \) for each iteration and the final \( ans \).**
