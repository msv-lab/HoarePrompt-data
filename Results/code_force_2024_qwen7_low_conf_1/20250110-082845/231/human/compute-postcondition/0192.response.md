The code changes `curType` to `1 - curType`. Given that `curType` is either 0 or 1, changing `curType` to `1 - curType` means if `curType` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`curType` is 1 if previously it was 0, otherwise it is 0; `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is `n + m`, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is updated based on the previous increment and switch condition, `types[i]` is equal to the new `curType`, `types[i + 1]` is equal to the new `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val] + a[types[i]][i]`, if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is switched to the other type, `bad` is equal to `i` and `badType` is 0.**
