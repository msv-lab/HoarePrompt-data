The code `curType = 1 - curType` changes the value of `curType` from its current value to its opposite. Given the initial state where `curType` is 1, it will become 0 after executing this line.

All other variables are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` must be greater than 2, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[1] + 2`, `bad` equals -1, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is 1, `types[1]` is 1, and `ans` is `a[1][0] + a[1][1]`.**
