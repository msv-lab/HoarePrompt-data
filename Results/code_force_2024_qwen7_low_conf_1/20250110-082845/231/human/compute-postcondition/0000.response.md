Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates based on the value of `input()`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `input()` returns a positive integer (since `int(input())` will return an integer).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input value will always be within this range. However, we need to ensure that the loop runs exactly `t` times.
   - We need to set up the initial state such that the loop will run `t` times.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:
- `t` should be correctly set as an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The loop will run exactly `t` times, so we need to initialize a variable (let's call it `count`) to 0 and increment it inside the loop until it reaches `t`.

However, since we are asked to adjust the initial state, we only need to ensure that `t` is set appropriately.

Therefore, the required state before the loop is:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute exactly `t` times.
