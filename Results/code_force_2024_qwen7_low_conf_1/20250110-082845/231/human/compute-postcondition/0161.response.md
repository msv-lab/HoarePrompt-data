Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State Before the Loop Starts:
- `i` is `i_val`
- `a` is now `a` with an additional row `new_row` at the end
- `curType` is the same
- `cur[curType]` is the same
- `bad` is `-1`
- `badType` is `-1`
- `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements each being `0`
- `ans` is `0`
- `val` is either `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[types[n + m]][n + m]` or `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` depending on the conditions
- `res` is a list of length `n + m + 1` containing the value of `ans` appended to the previous list
- `n` is the first integer from input
- `m` is the second integer from input
- `bounds` is `[n, m]`
- `cur` is `[0, 0]`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n + m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The for loop iterates over `range(n + m)`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n + m` is a positive integer. 

To ensure the loop can execute, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. **`n` and `m`**: Both `n` and `m` must be non-negative integers. The sum `n + m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
2. **`i`**: The variable `i` will take values from `0` to `n + m - 1` during the loop iterations. Since `i` starts at `i_val`, we need to ensure `i_val` is within the valid range for the loop to proceed correctly.

### Adjusted States:
- Ensure `n` is a non-negative integer.
- Ensure `m` is a non-negative integer.
- Ensure `n + m > 0`.
- Ensure `i_val` is within the range `0` to `n + m - 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` must be greater than 0, `i_val` must be between 0 and n + m - 1 inclusive**
