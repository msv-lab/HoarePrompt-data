`bounds` is assigned the list `[n, m]`. This means that `n` and `m` are now elements of the `bounds` list. The values of `t` and `n` (as an individual variable) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from input; `m` is the second integer from input; `bounds` is `[n, m]`**
