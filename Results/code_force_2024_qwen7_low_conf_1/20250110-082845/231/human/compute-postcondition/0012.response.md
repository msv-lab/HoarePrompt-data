The variable `curType` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` and `m` must be non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`; `curType` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `m` must be non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`; `curType` is 0**
