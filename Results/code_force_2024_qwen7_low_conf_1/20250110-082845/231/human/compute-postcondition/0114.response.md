The code `curType = 0` sets the value of `curType` to 0. This changes the value of `curType` from its previous state (which was the opposite of its original value) to 0. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` is the same as before, `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1, `bad` is either `i + 1` or `-1`, `badType` is `1 - curType` if `bad` is `i + 1`, `types[i]` is `curType` determined by the relationship between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, and `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]`, with `i` being `i + 1`.**
