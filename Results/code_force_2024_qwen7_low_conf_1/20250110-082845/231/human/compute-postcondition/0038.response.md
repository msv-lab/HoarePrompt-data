Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`
   - `curType` is 1
   - `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 2`
   - `bad` equals -1
   - `badType` is 1
   - `types[0]` is 1
   - `types[1]` is 1
   - `ans` is `a[1][0] + a[1][1]`

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n + m)`

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + m`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `i < n + m` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `n + m` must be greater than 2.

5. **Other States:**
   - `curType`, `cur[curType]`, `bad`, `badType`, `types[0]`, `types[1]`, and `ans` do not change within the loop body based on the information given.

Given these considerations, the updated states at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2
- `n + m` must be greater than 2 (ensuring the loop condition holds)
- `curType` remains 1
- `cur[curType]` remains `bounds[curType] + 2`
- `bad` remains -1
- `badType` remains 1
- `types[0]` remains 1
- `types[1]` remains 1
- `ans` remains `a[1][0] + a[1][1]`

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` must be greater than 2, `curType` is 1, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 2`, `bad` equals -1, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is 1, `types[1]` is 1, and `ans` is `a[1][0] + a[1][1]`**
