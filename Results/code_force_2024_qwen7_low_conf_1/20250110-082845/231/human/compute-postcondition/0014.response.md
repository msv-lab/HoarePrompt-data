`curType` is assigned the value 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 1, and the current value of `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`**
