Postcondition: **`ans` is 10, `a` is [[1, 2], [3, 4]], `types` is [1, 0], `i` is 2, `val` is -5, `res` is a list with 2 additional elements. The if condition checks if `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `(types[i] == badType)`. If the condition is true, the postcondition remains as described in the if part. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as described in the else part.**
