Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `ans` is 10
   - `a` is `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
   - `types` is `[1, 0]`
   - `i` is 3
   - `val` is -5
   - `res` is a list with its initial 2 elements plus -5, i.e., `[-5, -5, -5]`

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]
   ```
   - `types[i]` is `types[3]`. Since `types` is `[1, 0]`, this will raise an `IndexError` because the index `3` is out of range (valid indices are `0` and `1`).
   - The error `IndexError` is raised before any further changes to the variables.

Since the code raises an `IndexError`, no further changes are made to the variables. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 10, `a` is [[1, 2], [3, 4]], `types` is [1, 0], `i` is 3, `val` is -5, `res` is [-5, -5, -5]**
