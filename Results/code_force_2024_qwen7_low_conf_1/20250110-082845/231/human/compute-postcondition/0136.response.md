`val` is assigned the value of `ans - a[types[i]][i]`. The value of `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i+1]][i+1]`, and `a[types[i]][i]` is a specific value from the array `a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `curType` is the same, `cur[curType]` is the same, `bad` is the same, `badType` is the same, `types` is the same, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i+1]][i+1]`, `res` is the list with one additional element, which is the previous `val` plus `a[types[i+1]][n + m]`, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i]`**
