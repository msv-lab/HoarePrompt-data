The code `badType = 1 - curType` assigns the value `1 - curType` to `badType`. Given that `curType` is initially 1, `1 - curType` would be `0`. Therefore, `badType` is set to 0.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`curType` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1, `types[i + 1]` is equal to `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`, `bad` is equal to `i`, `badType` is 0.**
