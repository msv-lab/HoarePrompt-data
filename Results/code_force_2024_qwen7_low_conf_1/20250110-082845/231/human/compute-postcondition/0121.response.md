Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` changes to 1 if it was originally 0 and to 0 if it was originally 1, `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1, `bad` is either `i` or `-1`, `badType` is `1 - curType` if `bad` is `i`, `types[i]` is determined by the relationship between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, and `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]` based on whether `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]` or not.***
