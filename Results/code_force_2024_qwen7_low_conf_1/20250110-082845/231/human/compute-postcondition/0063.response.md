The code `val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]` updates the value of `val`. According to the initial state, `val` is equal to `ans - a[types[i]][i]`. After executing the code, `val` will be updated to `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `ans`, `a`, `types`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`, `ans` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `types` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged**
