The code `val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]` updates the value of `val`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1,
- `bad` is unchanged,
- `types` is unchanged,
- `badType` is unchanged,
- `ans` is unchanged,
- `a` is unchanged,
- `n` is unchanged,
- `m` is unchanged,
- `res` contains the previous elements plus the value of `val` and `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i]`.

After executing the code, the value of `val` is updated to `val + a[types[i]][n + m]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `bad` is unchanged, `types` is unchanged, `badType` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `res` contains the previous elements plus the value of `val`, and `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`**.
