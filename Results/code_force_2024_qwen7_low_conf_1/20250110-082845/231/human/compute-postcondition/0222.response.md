Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `curType` is 0 or 1.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `cur[curType]` is either `n` or `m`.
- `cur[1 - curType]` is the other bound.
- `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each being `0` or `1`.
- `ans` is the sum of selected elements from `a` based on the loop logic.
- `bad` and `badType` are `-1` or have specific values based on the conditions.
- `res` is an empty list.

### Loop Code Analysis:
```python
for i in range(n + m):
    val = ans - a[types[i]][i]
    if bad != -1 and i < bad and types[i] == badType:
        val = val + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]
    else:
        val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]
    res.append(val)
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n + m - 1`.
2. **Calculation of `val`**:
   - Initially, `val` is calculated as `ans - a[types[i]][i]`.
   - Depending on the condition (`bad != -1`), `val` may be adjusted.
   - Finally, `val` is appended to `res`.

### Output State After All Iterations:
To determine the final state, we need to consider what happens after the loop completes all iterations.

#### Final Values:
- **`res`**: This list accumulates values for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `n + m` times, `res` will contain `n + m` elements.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` remains unchanged after the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
- **`types`**: The value of `types` remains unchanged after the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` will be `n + m` after the loop completes.
- **`val`**: The value of `val` will be the last value calculated by the loop, which is `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1]` unless it is adjusted due to the `if` condition.

### Detailed Output State:
Given the above observations, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations (assuming the loop executes all `n + m` times) is:

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of selected elements from `a` based on the loop logic, `res` is a list of length `n + m` where each element is the value of `val` for each iteration, `types` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `n + m`, `val` is the value calculated for the last iteration.**
