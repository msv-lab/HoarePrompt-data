`curType` is updated to 1, which means it is no longer the value it was before. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `curType` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1, `types[i + 1]` is equal to `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`.

Output State: **`curType` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1, `types[i + 1]` is equal to `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`**
