`curType` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `i_val` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n + m` must be greater than 0 and `i_val` must be between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive is still valid.

Output State: **`curType` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive**
