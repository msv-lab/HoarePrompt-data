The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them into `n` and `m`. The input value must be in the form of two integers separated by a space.

Since the initial state specifies that the input value must be greater than zero, the values of `n` and `m` will be positive integers after this operation. However, the specific values of `n` and `m` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values.

All other variables (`res`, `i`, `bad`, `types`, `badType`, `ans`, `a`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the calculated values of `val` for each iteration of the loop plus the current value of `ans`, `i` is `n + m`, `bad` is unchanged, `types` is unchanged, `badType` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, the input value must be greater than zero, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, the values of `n` and `m` are positive integers.**
