The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Let's break down the impact:

- `cur[types[i]]` is being incremented by 1.
- The value of `types[i]` is determined by the relationship between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`. However, the exact value of `types[i]` is not specified in the initial state, so we will keep it as `types[i]`.
- The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the only change is to the value of `cur[types[i]]`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `cur[curType]` is the same as before, `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1, `bad` is either `i + 1` or `-1`, `badType` is `1 - curType` if `bad` is `i + 1`, `types[i]` is `curType` determined by the relationship between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, and `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]`.**
