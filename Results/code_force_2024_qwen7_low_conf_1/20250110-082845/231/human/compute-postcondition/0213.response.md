Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `ans` is 10
   - `a` is `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
   - `types` is `[1, 0]`
   - `i` is 2
   - `val` is -5
   - `res` is a list with 2 additional elements (though its content is not relevant for this calculation)

2. Code Execution:
   - `val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]`

3. Variable Values Before Execution:
   - `val` is -5
   - `types[i]` is `types[2]`. However, since `types` only has two elements, the index 2 is out of bounds, which would typically cause an error in Python. For the sake of this problem, let's assume this line is not executed due to an out-of-bounds error.

Since the line `val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]` leads to an out-of-bounds error due to the index `i` being 2 while `types` only has indices 0 and 1, no changes occur to any variables.

Output State: **`ans` is 10, `a` is [[1, 2], [3, 4]], `types` is [1, 0], `i` is 2, `val` is -5, `res` is a list with 2 additional elements**
