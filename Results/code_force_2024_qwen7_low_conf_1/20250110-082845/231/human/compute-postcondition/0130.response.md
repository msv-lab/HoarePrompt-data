Output State: **`i` is less than `n + m` and equal to `bad`, `curType` is either 0 or 1 based on the last comparison between `a[0][i-1]` and `a[1][i-1]`, `cur[curType]` is `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is undefined (since `bad` is `-1`), `types` is a list of length `n + m` where each element is either 0 or 1 based on the comparison within the loop, `ans` is updated by adding `a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`, `a` remains unchanged, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `bounds` remains unchanged, `cur` is `[bounds[0] + 1, bounds[1] + 1]`, `res` is an empty list, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i]`**.
