The code `res.append(val)` appends the value of `val` to the list `res`. Based on the initial state, the value of `val` depends on the conditions specified. Since the exact values of `bad`, `i`, `types`, `badType`, `ans`, `a`, and `n + m` are not given, we will keep the expressions for `val`.

The initial state is:
- `res` is an empty list.
- If `bad` is not equal to -1 and `i` is less than `bad` and `types[i]` is equal to `badType`, then `val` is `ans - a[badType][i] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`.
- Otherwise, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`.

After executing the line `res.append(val)`, the value of `res` will be the list containing the value of `val`.

Output State: **`res` is `[val]`, where `val` is either `ans - a[badType][i] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` if `bad` is not equal to -1 and `i` is less than `bad` and `types[i]` is equal to `badType`, or `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]` otherwise.**
