Output State: **`curType` is 0 or 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1, `types[i]` is equal to `curType`, `types[i + 1]` is equal to `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]` + `a[types[i]][i]`, If `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is switched to the other type (0 if `curType` is 1, and 1 if `curType` is 0). If `bad == -1` and `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is equal to `i` and `badType` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The line `ans += a[types[i]][i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding `a[types[i]][i]` to its current value.
- Since `types[i]` is equal to `curType`, this means `ans` is increased by `a[curType][i]`.
- The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
