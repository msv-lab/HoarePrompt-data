Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` must be greater than 2, `curType` is either 0 or remains unchanged, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 2`, `bad` is set to 2, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is 1, `types[1]` is 1, `types[2]` is equal to `curType`, `ans` is `a[1][0] + a[1][1] + a[types[2]][2]`, and `a[types[i]][i]` is added to `ans`.**
