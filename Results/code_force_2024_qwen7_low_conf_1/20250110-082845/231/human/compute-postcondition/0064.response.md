Postcondition: ***`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1. If `bad` is not -1 and `i` is less than `bad` and `types[i]` equals `badType`, then `val` is equal to `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`. Otherwise, `val` is equal to `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`, `ans` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `types` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `m` remains unchanged.***
