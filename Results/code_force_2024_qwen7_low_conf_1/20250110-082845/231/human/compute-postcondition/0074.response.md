The code `print(*res)` prints the elements of the list `res`. This does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. The output of the print statement will display the contents of `res`, but the list itself and all its elements remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the calculated values of `val` for each iteration of the loop plus the current value of `ans`, `i` is `n + m`, `bad` is unchanged, `types` is unchanged, `badType` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged.**
