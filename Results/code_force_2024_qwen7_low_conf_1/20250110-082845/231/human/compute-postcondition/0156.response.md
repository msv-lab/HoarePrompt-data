The code `bad = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `bad`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `i` is `i_val`
- `a` is now `a` with an additional row `new_row` at the end
- `curType` is the same
- `cur[curType]` is the same
- `bad` is `-1`
- `badType` is the same
- `types` is the same
- `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1]` is the same
- `val` is either `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[types[n + m]][n + m]` or `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` depending on the conditions
- `res` is a list of length `n + m + 1` containing the value of `ans` appended to the previous list
- `n` is the first integer from input
- `m` is the second integer from input
- `bounds` is `[n, m]`

Output State: **`i` is `i_val`, `a` is now `a` with an additional row `new_row` at the end, `curType` is the same, `cur[curType]` is the same, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is the same, `types` is the same, `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1]` is the same, `val` is either `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[types[n + m]][n + m]` or `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` depending on the conditions, `res` is a list of length `n + m + 1` containing the value of `ans` appended to the previous list, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `bounds` is `[n, m]`**
