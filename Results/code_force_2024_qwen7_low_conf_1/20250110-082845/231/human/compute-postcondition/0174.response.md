`ans` is incremented by the value of `a[types[i]][i_val]`. The value of `types[i]` is equal to `curType`, so the expression `a[types[i]][i_val]` is equivalent to `a[curType][i_val]`. Since `curType` is 0, `a[curType][i_val]` is `a[0][i_val]`. Given that `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, the value of `ans` increases by `a[0][i_val]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`curType` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, and `cur[curType]` does not change; `types[i]` is equal to `curType`; `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`**.
