`a` is appended with a new list obtained by converting the space-separated integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous value of `i` is `n + m`, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the calculated values of `val` for each iteration of the loop plus the current value of `ans`, `i` is `n + m`, `bad` is unchanged, `types` is unchanged, `badType` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `a` is a list containing an additional list of integers (from the input) where the input value must be greater than zero, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `bounds` is `[n, m]`**
