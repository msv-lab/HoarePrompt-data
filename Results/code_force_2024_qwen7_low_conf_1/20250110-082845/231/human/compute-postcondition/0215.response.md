The code appends the value of `val` to the list `res`. Given that `val` is `-5`, the list `res` will now include this value. The initial state of `res` is a list with 2 additional elements, which means it initially had at least 2 elements. After appending `-5`, `res` will have 3 elements.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are:

- `ans` is still 10
- `a` is still `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
- `types` is still `[1, 0]`
- `i` is still 2
- `val` is still `-5`
- `res` is now a list with its initial 2 elements plus `-5`

Output State: **`ans` is 10, `a` is [[1, 2], [3, 4]], `types` is [1, 0], `i` is 2, `val` is -5, `res` is a list with its initial 2 elements plus -5**
