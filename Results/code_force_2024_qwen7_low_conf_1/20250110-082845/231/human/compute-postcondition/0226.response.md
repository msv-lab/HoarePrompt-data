The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to process a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m` along with sequences `a_i` and `b_i`. The function does not return a single value but seems to perform some operation based on these inputs. However, since the exact operation is not specified in the provided output cases, we will focus on the parameters accepted per test case.

For each test case:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(2 \leq n + m + 1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- Sequences `a_i` and `b_i` are given where \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq b_i\) for all `i`.

Given this, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m` along with sequences `a_i` and `b_i`.**
