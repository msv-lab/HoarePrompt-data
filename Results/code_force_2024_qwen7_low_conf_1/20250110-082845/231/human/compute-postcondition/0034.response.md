Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 1, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` equals -1, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is equal to `curType`, and `ans` is `a[curType][0]`.***

Explanation: Since the if part is executed, the condition `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` must be true. According to the if part's postcondition, this sets `curType` to 1, `cur[curType]` to `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` to -1, and `ans` to `a[curType][0]`. There is no else part, so these values remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition in the if statement is met.
