The code snippet `badType = 1 - curType` assigns the value `1 - curType` to `badType`. Given that `curType` is either 0 or 1, `badType` will be the opposite value. This means if `curType` is 0, `badType` will become 1, and if `curType` is 1, `badType` will become 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the only change is to the value of `badType`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` is 0 or 1, `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1, `bad` is `i`, `badType` is `1 - curType`, `types[i]` is determined by the relationship between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, and `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]` based on whether `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]` or not.**
