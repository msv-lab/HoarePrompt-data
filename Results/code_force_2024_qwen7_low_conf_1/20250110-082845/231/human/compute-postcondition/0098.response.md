The code `types[i] = curType` assigns the value of `curType` to the `types` list at index `i`. This updates the value of `types[i]` but does not affect the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `i` must be less than `n + m`
- `curType` is either 0 if `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`, or 1 otherwise
- `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`
- `bad` is equal to `i`
- `badType` is 1 - `curType`
- `types[i]` is now equal to `curType`

Output State: **`i` must be less than `n + m`, `curType` is either 0 if `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`, or 1 otherwise; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`; `bad` is equal to `i`; `badType` is 1 - `curType`; `types[i]` is now equal to `curType`**
