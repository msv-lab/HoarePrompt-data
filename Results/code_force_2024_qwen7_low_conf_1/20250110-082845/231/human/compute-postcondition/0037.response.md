The code updates the value of `cur[types[i]]` by incrementing it by 1. Given that `types[i]` is `1` (since `i` is `1` and `types[1]` is `1`), the value of `cur[1]` will be incremented by 1.

Before the execution, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, and since `curType` is `1`, `cur[1]` equals `bounds[1] + 1`.

After the execution, `cur[1]` will be `bounds[1] + 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 1, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 2`, `bad` equals -1, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is 1, `types[1]` is 1, and `ans` is `a[1][0] + a[1][1]`.**
