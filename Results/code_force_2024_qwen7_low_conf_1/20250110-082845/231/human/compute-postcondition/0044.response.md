The code assigns `1 - curType` to `badType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is 0. Therefore, `badType` becomes `1 - 0`, which is 1.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` must be greater than 2, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[1] + 2`, `bad` equals 2, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is 1, `types[1]` is 1, and `ans` is `a[1][0] + a[1][1]`**.
