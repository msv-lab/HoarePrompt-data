`bad` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` must be less than `n + m`, and the conditions related to `curType`, `cur[curType]`, and `bounds[curType]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` must be less than `n + m`; `curType` is either 0 if `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`, or 1 otherwise; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`; `bad` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`i` must be less than `n + m`; `curType` is either 0 if `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`, or 1 otherwise; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`; `bad` is equal to `i`**
