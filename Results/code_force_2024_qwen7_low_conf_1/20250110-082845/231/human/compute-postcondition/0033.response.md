Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 1, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` equals -1, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is equal to `curType`, and `ans` is `a[curType][0]`.***

Explanation: Since there is no else part in the if-else block, the postcondition of the if part directly becomes the overall postcondition of the if-else block. The only change is in the value of `bad`, which is set to -1 according to the if part's postcondition. All other variables retain their values as per the precondition.
