`bad` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 2, `bad` is updated to 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n + m` must be greater than 2, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[1] + 2`, `bad` equals 2, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is 1, `types[1]` is 1, and `ans` is `a[1][0] + a[1][1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` must be greater than 2, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[1] + 2`, `bad` equals 2, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is 1, `types[1]` is 1, and `ans` is `a[1][0] + a[1][1]`.**
