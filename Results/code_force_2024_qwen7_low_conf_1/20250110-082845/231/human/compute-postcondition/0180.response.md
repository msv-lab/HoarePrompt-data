The line `curType = 1 - curType` changes the value of `curType` from 0 to 1 if it was initially 0, or from 1 to 0 if it was initially 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Given the initial state:
- `curType` is 0,
- `n` is a non-negative integer,
- `m` is a non-negative integer,
- `n + m` is greater than 0,
- `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive,
- `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`,
- `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1,
- `types[i + 1]` is equal to `curType`,
- `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`.

After executing the line `curType = 1 - curType`, `curType` changes from 0 to 1.

Output State: **`curType` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1, `types[i + 1]` is equal to `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`**
