The code snippet `ans += a[types[i]][i]` increments `ans` by the value of `a[types[i]][i]`. Let's analyze the impact on each variable:

- `i` is less than `n + m`: This condition remains unchanged.
- `curType` changes to 1 if it was originally 0 and to 0 if it was originally 1: This condition also remains unchanged as the code does not affect `curType`.
- `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1: This condition remains unchanged as the code does not affect this variable.
- `bad` is either `i` or `-1`: This condition remains unchanged as the code does not affect this variable.
- `badType` is `1 - curType` if `bad` is `i`: This condition remains unchanged as the code does not affect this variable.
- `types[i]` is either 0 or 1: This condition remains unchanged as the code does not affect this variable.
- `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]` based on whether `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]` or not: `ans` is updated by adding the value of `a[types[i]][i]`.

Given these points, the only variable that is updated is `ans`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` changes to 1 if it was originally 0 and to 0 if it was originally 1, `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1, `bad` is either `i` or `-1`, `badType` is `1 - curType` if `bad` is `i`, `types[i]` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]`.**
