The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Given that `cur[curType]` was previously set to `bounds[curType]` and `types[i]` is now equal to `curType`, the value of `cur[curType]` will be incremented by 1.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `i` is less than `n + m`
   - `curType` is either 0 if `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`, or 1 otherwise
   - `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`
   - `bad` is equal to `i`
   - `badType` is `1 - curType`
   - `types[i]` is now equal to `curType`
   - `ans` is updated by adding `a[types[i]][i]` to its previous value

2. After executing `cur[types[i]] += 1`, the value of `cur[curType]` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` is either 0 if `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`, or 1 otherwise; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType] + 1`; `bad` is equal to `i`; `badType` is `1 - curType`; `types[i]` is now equal to `curType`; `ans` is updated by adding `a[types[i]][i]` to its previous value.**
