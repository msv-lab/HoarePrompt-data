Postcondition: **`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` is either 0 or 1 based on the last comparison between `a[0][i-1]` and `a[1][i-1]`, `cur[curType]` is `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` is either `-1` or the index `i - 1` if there was a reset condition, `badType` is `1 - curType` if `bad` is not `-1`, `types` is a list of length `n + m` where each element is either 0 or 1 based on the comparison within the loop, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`, `a` remains unchanged, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `bounds` remains unchanged, `cur` is `[bounds[0] + 1, bounds[1] + 1]`, `res` is an empty list, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i]`, and the condition `(bad != -1 and i < bad and (types[i] == badType))` is false**
