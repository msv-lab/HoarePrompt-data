`curType` is assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `i` is 1
- `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`
- `curType` is 1
- `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`
- `bad` equals 0
- `badType` is 1
- `types[0]` is equal to `curType`
- `ans` is `a[curType][0]`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 1, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` equals 0, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is equal to `curType`, and `ans` is `a[curType][0]`.**
