The code `curType = 1` changes the value of `curType` from its previous state to 1. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `curType` is now 1.
- `i` is still less than `n + m`.
- `cur[curType]` is the same as before because `curType` was just reassigned, not the value in `cur[1]`.
- `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1, but since `curType` is now 1, the value of `cur[types[i]]` is still valid but may have changed due to the increment.
- `bad` is either `i + 1` or `-1`.
- `badType` is `1 - curType`, which is now `1 - 1 = 0`.
- `types[i]` is determined by the relationship between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, but its value is not changed by this line of code.
- `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]`, but its value is not changed by this line of code.
- `i` is still `i + 1`.

Output State: **`curType` is 1, `i` is less than `n + m`, `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1, `bad` is either `i + 1` or `-1`, `badType` is 0, `types[i]` is determined by the relationship between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, and `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]`.**
