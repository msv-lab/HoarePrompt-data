Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `a[0][i]` being less than `a[1][i]`. If `a[0][i] < a[1][i]`, then `curType` is 1, `cur[curType]` is the same as before, `bad` is `i + 1`, `badType` is the same as before, `types[i + 1]` is 1, and `ans` is updated by adding `a[1][i + 1]` to its previous value. Otherwise, `curType` remains 0, `cur[curType]` is the same as before, `bad` is `i + 1`, `badType` is the same as before, and `types[i + 1]` is 0, with `ans` being updated by adding `a[0][i + 1]` to its previous value.***
