The code `types[i] = curType` assigns the value of `curType` to `types[i]`. Given the initial conditions, the only variables that change are `types[i]` which is now equal to `curType`, and no other variables are affected. 

Output State: **`curType` is 0 or 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1, `types[i]` is equal to `curType`, `types[i + 1]` is equal to `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`. If `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is switched to the other type (0 if `curType` is 1, and 1 if `curType` is 0). If `bad == -1` and `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is equal to `i` and `badType` is 0.**
