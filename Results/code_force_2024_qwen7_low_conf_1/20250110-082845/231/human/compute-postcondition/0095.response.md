The code assigns `1 - curType` to `badType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is either 0 or 1 depending on the comparison between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`. The value of `badType` will be the opposite of `curType`. 

- If `curType` is 0, then `badType` will be 1.
- If `curType` is 1, then `badType` will be 0.

Other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` must be less than `n + m`; `curType` is either 0 if `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`, or 1 otherwise; `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`; `bad` is equal to `i`; `badType` is 1 - `curType`**
