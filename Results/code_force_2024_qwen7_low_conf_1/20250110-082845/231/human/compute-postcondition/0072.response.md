Output State: **`res` is a list containing the calculated values of `val` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is `n + m`, `bad` is unchanged, `types` is unchanged, `badType` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`res`**: The loop appends a new value to `res` in each iteration. Since the loop runs from `0` to `n + m - 1`, `res` will contain `n + m` values after all iterations.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `n + m`. After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + m`.
- **`bad`, `types`, `badType`, `ans`, `a`, `n`, `m`**: These variables do not change within the loop. Therefore, their values remain the same as they were initially.

Since the loop runs exactly `n + m` times, `res` will have `n + m` elements, and `i` will be `n + m`. The values of other variables (`bad`, `types`, `badType`, `ans`, `a`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
