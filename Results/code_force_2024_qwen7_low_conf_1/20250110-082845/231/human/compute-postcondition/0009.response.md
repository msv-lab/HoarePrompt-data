The code `ans = 0` simply initializes the variable `ans` to 0. It does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of 0 to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from input; `m` is the second integer from input; `bounds` is `[n, m]`; `a` is `[x, y, [p, q]]`; `bad` is -1; `badType` is -1; `cur` is `[0, 0]`; `ans` is 0**
