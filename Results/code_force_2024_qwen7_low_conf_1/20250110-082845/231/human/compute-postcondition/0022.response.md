Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 0 if `a[0][0] < a[1][0]` and 1 otherwise, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`, and `bad` equals 0; `badType` is 1 if `curType` is 0 and 0 if `curType` is 1. Since the else part does not change the state when `bad != -1`, the overall postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
