The variable `curType` is reassigned the value `0`. This directly changes the value of `curType`. All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` equals 0, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is equal to `curType`, and `ans` is `a[curType][0]`.**
