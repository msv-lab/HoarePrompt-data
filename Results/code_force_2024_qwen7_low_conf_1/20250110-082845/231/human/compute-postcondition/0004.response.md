The code `a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))` reads two integers from input, splits them by spaces, converts them to integers, and appends them as a list to `a`. 

- `t` is unchanged and remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` remain as the first and second integers from the input, respectively.
- `bounds` is unchanged and remains `[n, m]`.
- `a` is updated to include the list of integers read from the input.

Let's denote the two integers read from the input as `x` and `y`. So, `a` will now contain `[x, y]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from input; `m` is the second integer from input; `bounds` is `[n, m]`; `a` is `[x, y]`**
