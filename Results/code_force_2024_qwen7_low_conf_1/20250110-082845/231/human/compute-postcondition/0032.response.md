The code `badType = 1 - curType` assigns the value `1 - curType` to `badType`. Given that `curType` is 1, `badType` will be `1 - 1`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 1, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` equals 1, `badType` is 0, `types[0]` is equal to `curType`, and `ans` is `a[curType][0]`.**
