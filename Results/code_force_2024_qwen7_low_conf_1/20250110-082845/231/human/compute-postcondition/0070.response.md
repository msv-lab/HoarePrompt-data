Postcondition: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1; `bad` is unchanged; `types` is unchanged; `badType` is unchanged; `ans` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `m` is unchanged; `res` contains the previous elements plus the value of `val`. If `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is the previous value of `val` plus `a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`. Otherwise, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`.**
