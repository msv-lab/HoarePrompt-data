Output State: **`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `cur[curType]` is the same as before, `bad` is either `i + 1` or `-1`, `badType` is `1 - curType` if `bad` is `i + 1`, `types[i]` is `curType`, `types[i + 1]` is determined by the relationship between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`, and `ans` is updated by adding either `a[0][i + 1]` or `a[1][i + 1]` to its previous value, `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]`.**
