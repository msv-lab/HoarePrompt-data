Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` equals 0, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is equal to `curType`, and `ans` is `a[curType][0]`. If `a[0][i] < a[1][i]`, then `curType` changes to 1, and `ans` is updated to `a[1][0]`. Otherwise, `curType` remains 0 and `ans` stays unchanged.***
