The code `a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))` takes two integers from input, splits them into a list, converts each element in the list to an integer using `map(int, ...)`, and then appends this list to `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer from input
- `m` is the second integer from input
- `bounds` is `[n, m]`
- `a` is `[x, y]`

After running the code:
- Two new integers (let's call them `p` and `q`) are taken as input and converted to integers.
- These integers are appended to the list `a` as a new sublist.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a` now contains `[x, y, [p, q]]`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from input; `m` is the second integer from input; `bounds` is `[n, m]`; `a` is `[x, y, [p, q]]`**
