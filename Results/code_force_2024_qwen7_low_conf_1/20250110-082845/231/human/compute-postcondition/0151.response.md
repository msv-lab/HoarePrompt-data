The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m`, but does not affect the other variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` and `m` are assigned the values of two integers separated by a space in the input.
2. All other variables (`i`, `curType`, `cur[curType]`, `bad`, `badType`, `types`, `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1]`, `val`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the new value of `int(input())`, `curType` is the same, `cur[curType]` is the same, `bad` is the same, `badType` is the same, `types` is the same, `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1]` is the same, `val` is either `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[types[n + m]][n + m]` or `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` depending on the conditions, `res` is a list of length `n + m + 1` containing the value of `ans` appended to the previous list, `n` is the first integer from input, and `m` is the second integer from input.**
