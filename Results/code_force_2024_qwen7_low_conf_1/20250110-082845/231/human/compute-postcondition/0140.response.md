Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `curType` is the same, `cur[curType]` is the same, `bad` is the same, `badType` is the same, `types` is the same, `ans` is the same as the original `ans - a[types[i]][i]`, `val` is `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i]][n + m]`, `res` is the list with one additional element, which is the previous `val` plus `a[types[i+1]][n + m]`.**
