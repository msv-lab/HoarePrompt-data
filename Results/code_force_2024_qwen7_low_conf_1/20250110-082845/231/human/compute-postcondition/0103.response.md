The code sets `curType` to 1. This changes the value of `curType` from its previous value (which was 0) to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `i` is less than `n + m`
- `curType` is now 1
- `cur[curType]` remains the same as before
- `bad` is `i + 1`
- `badType` remains the same as before
- `types[i + 1]` is still `curType` (which is now 1)
- `ans` is updated by adding `a[types[i + 1]][i + 1]` to its previous value, meaning `ans` is increased by `a[1][i + 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` is 1, `cur[curType]` is the same as before, `bad` is `i + 1`, `badType` is the same as before, `types[i + 1]` is 1, `ans` is updated by adding `a[1][i + 1]` to its previous value.**
