`curType` is updated to `1 - curType`. Given that `curType` was either 0 or 1 depending on the condition in the initial state, changing `curType` to `1 - curType` means that if `curType` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided initial state.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` is the opposite of its original value (if originally 0, now 1; if originally 1, now 0), `cur[curType]` is the same as before, `bad` is `i + 1`, `badType` is the same as before, `types[i + 1]` is 1 if `a[0][i] >= a[1][i]` and 0 if `a[0][i] < a[1][i]`, and `ans` is updated by adding either `a[0][i + 1]` or `a[1][i + 1]` to its previous value.**
