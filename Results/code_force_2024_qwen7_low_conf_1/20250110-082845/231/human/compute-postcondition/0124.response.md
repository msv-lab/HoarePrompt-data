The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. The previous value of `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` changes to 1 if it was originally 0 and to 0 if it was originally 1, `cur[types[i]]` is increased by 1, `bad` is either `i` or `-1`, `badType` is `1 - curType` if `bad` is `i`, `types[i]` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i].**
