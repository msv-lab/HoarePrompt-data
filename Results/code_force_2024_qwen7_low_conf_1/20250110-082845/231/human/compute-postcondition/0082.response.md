The line `badType = -1` simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `badType`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the calculated values of `val` for each iteration of the loop plus the current value of `ans`, `i` is `n + m`, `bad` is -1, `types` is unchanged, `badType` is -1, `ans` is unchanged, `a` is a list containing an additional list of integers (from the input) where the input value must be greater than zero, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `bounds` is `[n, m]`**
