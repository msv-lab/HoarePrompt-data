The code changes the value of `curType` to its opposite. If `curType` was 1, it becomes 0, and if it was 0, it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Initial State: `i` must be less than `n + m`, `curType` is either 1 if `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`, or 0 otherwise. The condition `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`.

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. `curType` is updated to `1 - curType`. This means if `curType` was 1, it becomes 0, and if it was 0, it becomes 1.

Output State: **`i` must be less than `n + m`, `curType` is either 0 if `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`, or 1 otherwise. The condition `cur[curType]` is equal to `bounds[curType]`.**
