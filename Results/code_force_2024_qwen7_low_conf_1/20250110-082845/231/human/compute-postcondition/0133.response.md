Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n + m`, `curType` is either 0 or 1 based on the last comparison between `a[0][i-1]` and `a[1][i-1]`, `cur[curType]` is `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` is either `-1` or the index `i - 1` if there was a reset condition, `badType` is `1 - curType` if `bad` is not `-1`, `types` is a list of length `n + m` where each element is either 0 or 1 based on the comparison within the loop, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n + m - 1`, considering the following cases:
- If `bad` is not `-1` and `i` is less than `bad` and `types[i]` equals `badType`, `ans` is updated by adding `a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`.
- Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and `val` is updated by adding `a[types[i]][n + m]`. `a`, `n`, `m`, `bounds`, `cur`, `res`, and `val` remain unchanged.***
