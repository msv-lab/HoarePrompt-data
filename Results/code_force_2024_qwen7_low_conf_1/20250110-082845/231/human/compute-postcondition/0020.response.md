`badType` is assigned the value `1 - curType`. Since `curType` is either 0 or 1, `badType` will be the opposite value. Therefore, if `curType` is 0, `badType` will be 1, and if `curType` is 1, `badType` will be 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 0 if `a[0][0] < a[1][0]` and 1 otherwise, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`, and `bad` equals 0; `badType` is 1 if `curType` is 0 and 0 if `curType` is 1.**
