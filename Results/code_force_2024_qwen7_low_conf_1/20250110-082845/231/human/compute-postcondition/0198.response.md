`ans` is increased by `a[types[i]][i]`. The value of `ans` was originally increased by `a[0][i_val] + a[types[i]][i]` before this line of code. Since `types[i]` is equal to `curType`, the current value added to `ans` is `a[curType][i_val]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`curType` is 0 or 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is `n + m`, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is updated based on the previous increment and switch condition, `types[i]` is equal to `curType`, `types[i + 1]` is equal to the new `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[curType][i_val] + a[types[i]][i]`, if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is switched to the other type, if `bad` is -1, then `bad` is set to `i` and `badType` is 1 - `curType`.**
