To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and constraints for the loop to start executing.

1. **Variables `i`, `n`, and `m`:**
   - The loop runs in the range `range(n + m)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n + m` must be at least 1 because the range function generates numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the upper limit.
   
2. **Variable `curType`:**
   - `curType` is either 0 or 1. This variable determines which element (`n` or `m`) is used in the loop logic.
   - Since the value of `curType` does not directly affect whether the loop starts, no adjustment is needed here regarding `curType`.

3. **Variables `cur[curType]` and `cur[1 - curType]`:**
   - These variables represent the bounds of the current iteration. `cur[curType]` is either `n` or `m`, and `cur[1 - curType]` is the other bound.
   - No adjustment is necessary as these values are set up by the initial conditions and do not impact whether the loop starts.

4. **List `types`:**
   - `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each being `0` or `1`.
   - The presence of this list is necessary for the loop to access elements during its iterations, but its contents do not directly impact whether the loop starts.

5. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the sum of selected elements from `a` based on the loop logic.
   - The value of `ans` at the start does not affect whether the loop starts, so no adjustment is needed here.

6. **Variables `bad` and `badType`:**
   - These variables can be `-1` or have specific values based on certain conditions. Their values do not impact whether the loop starts, so no adjustment is needed.

7. **Variable `res`:**
   - `res` is an empty list. Its state is irrelevant to whether the loop starts.

Given the above points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n + m` is at least 1.

**State:**
**`n + m` must be at least 1**
