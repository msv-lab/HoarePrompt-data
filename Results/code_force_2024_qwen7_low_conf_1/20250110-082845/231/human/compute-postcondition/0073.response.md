The code `res.append(ans)` appends the value of `ans` to the list `res`. The initial state does not specify what `ans` is, but it does not change the values of `i`, `bad`, `types`, `badType`, `ans`, `a`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the updated state will have `res` appended with the current value of `ans`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing the calculated values of `val` for each iteration of the loop plus the current value of `ans`, `i` is `n + m`, `bad` is unchanged, `types` is unchanged, `badType` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged.**
