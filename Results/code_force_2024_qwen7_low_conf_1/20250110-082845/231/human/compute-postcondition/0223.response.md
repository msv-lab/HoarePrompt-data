`res.append(ans)` appends the value of `ans` to the list `res`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged after this operation, and the value of `i` and `val` also remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of selected elements from `a` based on the loop logic, `res` is a list of length `n + m` with an additional element `ans` appended, `types` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `n + m`, `val` is the value calculated for the last iteration.**
