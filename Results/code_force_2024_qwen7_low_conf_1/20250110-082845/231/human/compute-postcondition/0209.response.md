The code snippet `res.append(val)` appends the value of `val` to the list `res`. However, the value of `val` is not specified in the initial state or the code snippet itself. Since `val` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. But we know that `res` will be modified.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is 10
- `a` is `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
- `types` is `[1, 0]`
- `i` is 1
- If `bad` is not -1, `i` is less than `bad`, and `types[i]` is equal to `badType`, then the function does not change `ans`. Otherwise, `bad` is -1 and `ans` remains unchanged at 10.

Since `val` is not defined, we cannot specify its value, but we can say that `res` will be appended with `val`.

Output State: **`ans` is 10, `a` is [[1, 2], [3, 4]], `types` is [1, 0], `i` is 1, `res` is a list with an additional element `val`.**
