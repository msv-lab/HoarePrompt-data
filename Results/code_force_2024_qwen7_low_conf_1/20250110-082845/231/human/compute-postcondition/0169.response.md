`bad` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, but its specific value was not provided in the initial state. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curType` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, the current value of `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, and `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`. The value of `bad` is `i`.**
