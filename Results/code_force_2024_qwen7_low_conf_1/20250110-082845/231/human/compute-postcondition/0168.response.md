Postcondition: ***`curType` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, the current value of `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, and `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`. The value of `bad` is -1.***
