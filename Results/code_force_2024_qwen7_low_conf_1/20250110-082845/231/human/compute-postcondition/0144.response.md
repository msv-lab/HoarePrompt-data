The code `val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]` updates the value of `val` by adding `a[types[i]][n + m]` to the current value of `val`. 

Let's break down the impact:

1. `val` was previously defined as `ans - a[types[i]][i]`.
2. Now, `val` is updated to `val + a[types[i]][n + m]`.

Given this, the new value of `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`.

The other variables remain unchanged in their previous states:
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- `curType` remains the same.
- `cur[curType]` remains the same.
- `bad` remains the same.
- `badType` remains the same.
- `types` remains the same.
- `ans - a[types[i-1]][i-1]` remains the same.
- `res` is a list with two additional elements, which are `(ans - a[types[i-1]][i-1]) + a[types[i+1]][n + m]` and `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i+2]][n + m]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `curType` is the same, `cur[curType]` is the same, `bad` is the same, `badType` is the same, `types` is the same, `ans - a[types[i-1]][i-1]` is the same, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`, `res` is a list with two additional elements, which are `(ans - a[types[i-1]][i-1]) + a[types[i+1]][n + m]` and `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i+2]][n + m]`**.
