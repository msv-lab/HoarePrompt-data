The provided code snippet reads two integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. Since the initial state only mentions `t` being an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and no other variables are mentioned, we need to account for the new variables `n` and `m` introduced by the code.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is assigned the first integer from input.
- `m` is assigned the second integer from input.

The initial state for `t` remains valid and unchanged, so `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from input; `m` is the second integer from input.**
