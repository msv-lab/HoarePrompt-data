`curType` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `curType` being `0` and keeping the values of the other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` must be greater than 2, `curType` is 0, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 2`, `bad` equals -1, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is 1, `types[1]` is 1, and `ans` is `a[1][0] + a[1][1]`**
