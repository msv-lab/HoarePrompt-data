The code snippet prints the contents of the list `res`. Since printing the list does not change its content, the only impact on the variables is the execution of the print statement. The values of the variables `i`, `curType`, `cur[curType]`, `bad`, `badType`, `types`, `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1]`, and `val` remain unchanged. The list `res` remains as it was before the print statement.

Output State: **`i` is `n + m`, `curType` is the same, `cur[curType]` is the same, `bad` is the same, `badType` is the same, `types` is the same, `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1]` is the same, `val` is either `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[types[n + m]][n + m]` or `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` depending on the conditions, `res` is a list of length `n + m + 1` containing the value of `ans` appended to the previous list, and `print(*res)` is executed.**
