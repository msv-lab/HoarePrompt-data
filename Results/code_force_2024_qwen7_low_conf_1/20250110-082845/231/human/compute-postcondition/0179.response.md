Postcondition: ***`curType` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is between 0 and `n + m - 1` inclusive, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is incremented by 1, `types[i + 1]` is equal to `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val]`***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and is explicitly mentioned as `None`, the postcondition of the if part directly becomes the overall postcondition of the if-else block. All the conditions and updates specified in the if part remain unchanged and form the final state of the program variables after the if-else block executes.
