Step 1: Calculate the new value of `val`.
- `ans` is 10.
- `types` is [1, 0].
- `i` is 3.

Since `i` (3) is out of bounds for `types` (which only has 2 elements), the index 3 does not exist in `types`. However, in Python, accessing an index that does not exist will raise an `IndexError`. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the code tries to access `types[i]` and fails due to the out-of-bound index.

Given this, the code would raise an `IndexError`.

Output State: **`ans` is 10, `a` is [[1, 2], [3, 4]], `types` is [1, 0], `i` is 3, `val` is -5, `res` is a list with its initial 2 elements plus -5, IndexError raised**
