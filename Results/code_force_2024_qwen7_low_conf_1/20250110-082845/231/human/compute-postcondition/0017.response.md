The code changes the value of `curType` to its opposite. Initially, `curType` is 1 if `a[0][0] < a[1][0]`, otherwise `curType` is 0. After executing `curType = 1 - curType`, if `curType` was initially 1, it becomes 0, and if it was initially 0, it becomes 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `cur`, and `bounds` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 0 if `a[0][0] < a[1][0]` and 1 otherwise, and `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`**
