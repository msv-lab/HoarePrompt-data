`curType` is reassigned the value `1 - curType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is 0. Therefore, `1 - curType` evaluates to `1 - 0`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, `curType` is 1, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType] + 1`, `bad` equals 0, `badType` is 1, `types[0]` is equal to `curType`, and `ans` is `a[curType][0]`.**
