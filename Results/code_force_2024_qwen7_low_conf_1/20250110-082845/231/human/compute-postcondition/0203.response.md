The given code snippet is incomplete and does not provide enough context to determine the values of `ans`, `a`, `types`, and `i`. However, based on the provided initial state, let's assume the following:

- `ans` is a variable holding a specific value.
- `a` is a list where `a[types[i]][i]` is an element from this list.
- `types` is a list or array where `types[i]` is an index into the list `a`.
- `i` is an index into both `types` and the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
```
val = ans - a[types[i]][i]
```

Let's assume specific values for the sake of calculation:
- Let `ans = 10`
- Let `a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
- Let `types = [1, 0]`
- Let `i = 1`

So, `a[types[i]][i]` translates to `a[types[1]][1]`, which is `a[0][1]`. From the list `a`, `a[0][1]` is `2`.

Therefore, the code becomes:
```
val = 10 - 2
```

This results in:
```
val = 8
```

The output state will reflect the new value of `val` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 10, `a` is [[1, 2], [3, 4]], `types` is [1, 0], `i` is 1, `val` is 8**
