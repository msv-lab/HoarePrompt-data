`res.append(val)` appends the value of `val`, which is -5, to the list `res`. Initially, `res` is `[-5, -5, -5]`. After appending -5, `res` becomes `[-5, -5, -5, -5]`.

The value of `ans`, `a`, `types`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 10, `a` is [[1, 2], [3, 4]], `types` is [1, 0], `i` is 3, `val` is -5, `res` is [-5, -5, -5, -5]**
