The code sets `curType` to 0. This changes the value of `curType` from its previous state (which could be 0 or 1) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`curType` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i_val` is `n + m`, `a[0][i_val]` is less than `a[1][i_val]`, `cur[curType]` is updated based on the previous increment and switch condition, `types[i]` is equal to the new `curType`, `types[i + 1]` is equal to the new `curType`, `ans` is increased by `a[0][i_val] + a[types[i]][i]`, if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is switched to the other type, `bad` is equal to `i` and `badType` is 0.**
