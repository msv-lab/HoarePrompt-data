The code `print(*res)` simply prints the elements of the list `res`. It does not change the values of any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of selected elements from `a` based on the loop logic, `res` is a list of length `n + m` with an additional element `ans` appended, `types` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `n + m`, `val` is the value calculated for the last iteration. The list `res` is printed.**
