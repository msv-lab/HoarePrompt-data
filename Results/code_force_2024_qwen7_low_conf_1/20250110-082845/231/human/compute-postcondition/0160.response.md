The code initializes the `types` list with `(0)` for each index from `0` to `n + m`. This means that each element in `types` will be `0`.

- The initial value of `types` was a list with a specific structure, now it is explicitly set to a list of `n + m + 1` elements, each being `0`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i_val`, `a` is now `a` with an additional row `new_row` at the end, `curType` is the same, `cur[curType]` is the same, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is `-1`, `types` is a list of `n + m + 1` elements each being `0`, `ans` is `0`, `val` is either `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[types[n + m]][n + m]` or `ans - a[types[n + m - 1]][n + m - 1] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` depending on the conditions, `res` is a list of length `n + m + 1` containing the value of `ans` appended to the previous list, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `cur` is `[0, 0]`**.
