t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 0 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ n + m + 1 ≤ 2·10^5. a and b are lists of integers where a contains the programming skills and b contains the testing skills of the candidates, both lists have length n + m + 1, and the elements in a and b are distinct such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
