Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`.
3. It sorts the input list of numbers in descending order, which is crucial for forming a triangle because the largest values should be used first.
4. The program splits the sorted list into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc`.
5. It calculates the sums of these groups.
6. To check if the sums can form a triangle, the program uses the triangle inequality theorem: for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.
7. If the triangle inequality holds, it prints "YES" followed by the elements of the three groups.
8. If the triangle inequality does not hold, it prints "NO".

Given that the problem description aligns with the implemented logic, and the program follows the steps to solve the problem correctly, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
