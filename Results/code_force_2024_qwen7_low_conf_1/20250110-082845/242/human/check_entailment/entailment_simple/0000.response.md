Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the following points indicate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Sorting and Grouping**: 
   - The program sorts the list `x` in descending order and then divides it into three groups based on the indices. However, this approach does not guarantee that the sums of the groups will satisfy the triangle inequality condition (`s_a + s_b > s_c`, `s_b + s_c > s_a`, and `s_c + s_a > s_b`). Sorting in descending order might not lead to a valid split that forms a triangle.

2. **Triangle Inequality Check**:
   - The program checks the triangle inequality condition after grouping the numbers. While this step is correct, the issue lies in how the groups are formed. The initial sorting and grouping method might not yield a valid solution because it does not consider the actual values of the numbers being grouped together.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the triangle inequality condition is satisfied. However, the requirement to output the specific groups of numbers (if the answer is 'YES') is not addressed in the provided code. The groups are printed, but there is no guarantee that these groups are part of the solution that satisfies the triangle inequality condition.

### Correct Approach:
To ensure the program meets the requirements, a more detailed algorithm is needed to check all possible combinations of splitting the numbers into three groups and verify if they satisfy the triangle inequality condition. Here's a high-level outline of what the correct approach could look like:

1. **Generate All Possible Combinations**: Generate all possible ways to split the numbers into three groups.
2. **Check Triangle Inequality**: For each combination, check if the sums of the groups satisfy the triangle inequality condition.
3. **Output Result**: If a valid combination is found, output the groups and 'YES'. Otherwise, output 'NO'.

Given the constraints, a brute-force approach might not be feasible due to the large number of combinations. Therefore, a heuristic or more optimized approach might be necessary to ensure efficiency.

Since the provided program does not address these critical aspects, it fails to meet the full requirements of the problem description.
