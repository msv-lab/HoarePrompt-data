You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n positive integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n and three positive
integers n_a, n_b, n_c satisfying n_a+n_b+n_c = n .

You want to split the n positive integers into three groups, so that:

  * The first group contains n_a numbers, the second group contains n_b numbers, the third group contains n_c numbers.
  * Let s_a be the sum of the numbers in the first group, s_b be the sum in the second group, and s_c be the sum in the third group. Then s_a, s_b, s_c are the sides of a triangle with positive area.

Determine if this is possible. If this is possible, find one way to do so.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1\le t\le 100\,000 ) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the t
test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains the integers n, n_a, n_b, n_c (3
\leq n \leq 200\,000, 1\leq n_a,n_b,n_c \leq n-2, n_a+n_b+n_c = n ) — the
number of integers to split into three groups, and the desired sizes of the
three groups.

The second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n (1
\leq x_i \leq 10^{9} ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed
200\,000 .

Output

For each test case, print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to split the numbers
into three groups satisfying all the conditions. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO}
.

If such a split exists, then describe the three groups as follows.

On the next line, print n_a integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n_a} — the numbers
in the first group.

On the next line, print n_b integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n_b} — the numbers
in the second group.

On the next line, print n_c integers c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n_c} — the numbers
in the third group.

These n_a+n_b+n_c=n integers should be a permutation of x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n
, and they should satisfy the conditions from the statement.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 3 1 1
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 3
    
    8 1 2 5
    
    16 1 1 1 1 1 1 12

Output

    YES
    1 1 
    1 1 
    1 1 
    NO
    NO
    YES
    16 
    12 1 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, we can put two 1 s into each group: the sum in each
group would be 2 , and there exists a triangle with positive area and sides 2
, 2 , 2 .

In the second and third test cases, it can be shown that there is no such way
to split numbers into groups.

In the fourth test case, we can put number 16 into the first group, with sum
16 , numbers 12 and 1 into the second group, with sum 13 , and the remaining
five 1 s into the third group, with sum 5 , as there exists a triangle with
positive area and sides 16, 13, 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000.

Additionally, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\); `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are updated to the integers input by the user where `na + nb + nc = n` and \(1 \leq na, nb, nc \leq n-2\); `x` is a list of integers read from the user and sorted in descending order; `_` is `t`; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order); `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `nc` elements of `x` (in their original order); `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`; `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`. After executing all iterations of the loop, the program checks if the condition `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and sum_c + sum_a > sum_b` is true. If the condition is true, the program prints 'YES' followed by the elements of `group_b` and `group_c` in string form separated by spaces. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `t` (the number of test cases), an integer `n` (such that \(3 \leq n \leq 200,000\)), integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (such that \(1 \leq na, nb, nc \leq n-2\) and \(na + nb + nc = n\)), and a list of integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` (such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\)). The function sorts the list `x` in descending order, divides it into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) based on the values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc`, calculates the sum of each group, and checks if the sums satisfy the triangle inequality conditions: `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`. If the triangle inequality conditions are satisfied, the function prints 'YES' followed by the elements of `group_b` and `group_c` in string form separated by spaces. If the conditions are not satisfied, the function prints 'NO'. The function handles all test cases sequentially and ensures that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 200,000. Edge cases such as invalid input (e.g., `n < 3`, `na + nb + nc != n`, `na, nb, nc < 1`, or `na, nb, nc > n-2`) are implicitly handled by the constraints and input validation within the code.
