Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in checking the triangle inequality conditions. Specifically, the condition `if sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and (sum_c + sum_a > sum_b):` is incorrect. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, the correct conditions should be:

```python
if sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and sum_c + sum_a > sum_b:
```

However, the program incorrectly uses parentheses around the last condition, which changes its meaning. The correct implementation should be:

```python
if sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and sum_c + sum_a > sum_b:
```

Without the parentheses, the current condition checks `(sum_c + sum_a > sum_b)` only if the previous two conditions are true, which is not the intended logic. This error can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs, making the program incorrect according to the problem description.
