The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and converts each integer into a list. The previous values of `t`, `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `x`, `_`, `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` remain unchanged. After executing this code, `x` is updated to a list of integers converted from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) (decreased by 1); `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are updated to the integers input by the user; `x` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\) sorted in descending order before the execution of this line of code, now `x` is a list of integers read from the user and converted to integers; `_` is 1; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order) before the execution of this line of code, now `group_a` is the first `na` elements of the new `x` (in descending order); `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order) before the execution of this line of code, now `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of the new `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order) before the execution of this line of code, now `group_c` is the last `n - na - nb` elements of the new `x` (in their original order); `sum_a` is the sum of the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order) before the execution of this line of code, now `sum_a` is the sum of the first `na` elements of the new `x` (in descending order); `sum_b` is the sum of the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order) before the execution of this line of code, now `sum_b` is the sum of the next `nb` elements of the new `x` (in their original order); `sum_c` is the sum of the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order) before the execution of this line of code, now `sum_c` is the sum of the last `n - na - nb` elements of the new `x` (in their original order).**
