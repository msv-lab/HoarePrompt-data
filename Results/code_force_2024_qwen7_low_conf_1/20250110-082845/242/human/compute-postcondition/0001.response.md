State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000, n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ n_a, n_b, n_c ≤ n-2, and n_a + n_b + n_c = n, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, `_` is now 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `_` in `for _ in range(t):` will take values from 0 to t-1.
2. Before the loop starts, the value of `_` should be set to 0 to indicate the start of the first iteration.
3. The value of `t` should be valid as per the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000).
4. Since the values of `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` are used in the loop but not modified within the loop itself, they do not need to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute. However, their initial conditions must be respected.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial value of the loop variable `_` as 0, while ensuring that `t` is within the specified range.
