`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `t` will now hold the integer input from the user. The values of `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`, and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input from the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000; `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, 1 ≤ n_a, n_b, n_c ≤ n-2, and n_a + n_b + n_c = n; `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9**
