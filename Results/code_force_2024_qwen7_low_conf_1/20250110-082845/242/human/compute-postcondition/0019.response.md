Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers such that \(1 \leq na, nb, nc \leq n-2\) and \(na + nb + nc = n\).
- `x` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\) sorted in descending order.
- `_` is 1.
- `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order).
- `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order).
- `group_c` is the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order).
- `sum_a` is the sum of the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order).
- `sum_b` is the sum of the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order).
- `sum_c` is the sum of the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order).
- The condition `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b` determines the output.
- If the conditions are met, the output is 'YES' followed by the string form of `group_b` and `group_c` separated by spaces. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.

### For Loop Statement
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop runs `t` times, and we need to determine the state at the start of each iteration.
- Since `t` is the number of iterations, it will decrease by 1 at the start of each iteration until it reaches 0.

### State Adjustments for the Next Iteration
At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be:

- `t - 1`

All other variables (`n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `x`, `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`) remain unchanged.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000 (decreased by 1), `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ na, nb, nc ≤ n-2 and na + nb + nc = n, `x` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9 sorted in descending order, `_` is 1, `group_a` is the first na elements of x (in descending order), `group_b` is the next nb elements of x (in their original order), `group_c` is the last n - na - nb elements of x (in their original order), `sum_a` is the sum of the first na elements of x (in descending order), `sum_b` is the sum of the next nb elements of x (in their original order), `sum_c` is the sum of the last n - na - nb elements of x (in their original order)`**.
