Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\), `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are updated to the integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers read from the user and sorted in descending order, `_` is 1, `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order), `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order), `group_c` is the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order), `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`. If the condition `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and (sum_c + sum_a > sum_b)` is true, the program prints the elements of `group_c` separated by spaces. Otherwise, the string 'NO' is printed to the console.***
