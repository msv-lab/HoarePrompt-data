`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are assigned the values obtained from the input split and converted to integers. The values of `t`, `x_1`, `x_2`, ..., `x_n`, `_`, and `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c` are not affected by this operation.

The values of `n_a`, `n_b`, and `n_c` should still satisfy the condition `n_a + n_b + n_c = n`. The values of `t`, `x_1`, `x_2`, ..., `x_n`, `_`, and `n` are unknown but fall within their respective ranges.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ na, nb, nc ≤ n-2, and `n_a` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, `x_1`, `x_2`, ..., `x_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, `_` is 1**
