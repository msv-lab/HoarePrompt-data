The code `print(' '.join(map(str, group_c)))` does the following:
1. It converts each element in `group_c` to a string using `map(str, group_c)`.
2. It joins these string representations with a space `' '` using `' '.join(...)`.
3. It prints the resulting string.

Since the code only prints the elements of `group_c` separated by spaces, it does not affect any of the variables' values directly. The values of `group_a`, `group_b`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` remain unchanged, and `_` remains 2.

Output State: **`x` is sorted in descending order; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of the sorted `x`; `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of the sorted `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `nc` elements of the sorted `x` but in their new order (from index `na + nb` to the end); `_` is 2; `sum_a` is the sum of elements in `group_a`; `sum_b` is the sum of elements in `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of elements in `group_c` and remains unchanged.**
