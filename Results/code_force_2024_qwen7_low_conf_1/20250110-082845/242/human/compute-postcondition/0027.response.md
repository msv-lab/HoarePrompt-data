The code snippet calculates the sum of elements in `group_b` and assigns it to `sum_b`. The values of `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`, `x`, `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `sum_a`, and the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

- `sum_b` is now the sum of the elements in `group_b`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\), `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are updated to the integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers read from the user and sorted in descending order, `_` is 1, `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order), `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order), `group_c` is the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order), `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`.**
