The code snippet reads four integers `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` from the user and assigns them to the respective variables. This operation updates the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq t < 100,000\), `_` is 2, `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order), `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order), `group_c` is the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order), `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`, `n` is the integer input from the user, `na` is the integer input from the user, `nb` is the integer input from the user, `nc` is the integer input from the user.**
