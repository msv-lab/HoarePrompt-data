The code `sum_a = sum(group_a)` calculates the sum of the elements in `group_a` and assigns this sum to `sum_a`. Since `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` in descending order, the sum of these elements is stored in `sum_a`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\); `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are updated to the integers input by the user; `x` is a list of integers read from the user and sorted in descending order; `_` is 1; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order); `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order); `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`.**
