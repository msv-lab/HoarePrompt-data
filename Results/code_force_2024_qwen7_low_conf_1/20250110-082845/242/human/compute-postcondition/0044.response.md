The code `sum_c = sum(group_c)` calculates the sum of the elements in `group_c` and assigns it to `sum_c`. Since `group_c` is the last `nc` elements of the sorted `x` but in their new order, the sum of its elements is already known as `sum_c`. The calculation does not change the sum but confirms it.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is sorted in descending order; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of the sorted `x`; `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of the sorted `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `nc` elements of the sorted `x` but in their new order (from index `na + nb` to the end); `_` is 2; `sum_a` is the sum of elements in `group_a`; `sum_b` is the sum of elements in `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of elements in `group_c` and remains unchanged.**
