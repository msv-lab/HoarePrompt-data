The code snippet `print(' '.join(map(str, group_b)))` prints the elements of `group_b` separated by spaces. This does not affect the values of the variables, it only prints them. The values of `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`, `x`, `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `total`, `num`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\), `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are updated to the integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers read from the user and sorted in descending order, `_` is 1, `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order), `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order), `group_c` is the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order), `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`. The program prints 'group_b' elements separated by spaces.**
