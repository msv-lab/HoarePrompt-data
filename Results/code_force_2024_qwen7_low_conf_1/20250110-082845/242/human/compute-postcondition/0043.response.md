The code `sum_b = sum(group_b)` calculates the sum of the elements in `group_b` and assigns it to `sum_b`. Since `group_b` is already defined as the next `nb` elements of the sorted `x` in their original order, and `sum_b` was previously undefined, now `sum_b` is updated with this sum. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`x` is sorted in descending order; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of the sorted `x`; `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of the sorted `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `nc` elements of the sorted `x` but in their new order (from index `na + nb` to the end); `_` is 2; `sum_a` is the sum of elements in `group_a`; `sum_b` is the sum of elements in `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of elements in `group_c`; `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are the same as before.**
