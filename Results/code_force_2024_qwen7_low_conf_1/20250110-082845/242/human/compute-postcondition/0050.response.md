Postcondition: ***`x` is sorted in descending order; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of the sorted `x`; `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of the sorted `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `nc` elements of the sorted `x` but in their new order (from index `na + nb` to the end); `_` is 2; `sum_a` is the sum of elements in `group_a`; `sum_b` is the sum of elements in `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of elements in `group_c` and remains unchanged.***

In this case, since both the if part and the else part describe the same conditions and do not alter the state of the variables, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
