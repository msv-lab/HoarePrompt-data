Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\); `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are updated to the integers input by the user where `na + nb + nc = n` and \(1 \leq na, nb, nc \leq n-2\); `x` is a list of integers read from the user and sorted in descending order; `_` is `t`; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order); `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `nc` elements of `x` (in their original order); `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`; `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`. After executing all iterations of the loop, the program checks if the condition `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and sum_c + sum_a > sum_b` is true. If the condition is true, the program prints 'YES' followed by the elements of `group_b` and `group_c` in string form separated by spaces. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.**
