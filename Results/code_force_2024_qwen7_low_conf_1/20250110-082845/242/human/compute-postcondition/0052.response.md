The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition (`def func_1():`). However, based on the constraints provided, it seems that the function should handle a series of test cases where each test case involves several integers.

For each test case, the function accepts:
- An integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` such that \(3 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- Integers `n_a`, `n_b`, and `n_c` such that \(1 \leq n_a, n_b, n_c \leq n-2\) and \(n_a + n_b + n_c = n\).
- A list or array of integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).

The function does not explicitly return anything from its current definition, but based on the problem statement, it should process these inputs and produce some output. Since the exact output is not specified in the given constraints, we will focus on the input parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a series of test cases defined by the given parameters and process them accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (the number of test cases), an integer `n` (such that \(3 \leq n \leq 200,000\)), integers `n_a`, `n_b`, and `n_c` (such that \(1 \leq n_a, n_b, n_c \leq n-2\) and \(n_a + n_b + n_c = n\)), and a list of integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` (such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\)).**
