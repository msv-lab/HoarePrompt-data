The code `sum_a = sum(group_a)` calculates the sum of the elements in `group_a` and assigns the result to `sum_a`. The values of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` remain unchanged. The variables `x`, `_`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`, `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is sorted in descending order; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of the sorted `x`; `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of the sorted `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `nc` elements of the sorted `x` but in their new order (from index `na + nb` to the end); `_` is 2; `sum_a` is the sum of elements in `group_a`; `sum_b`, `sum_c` are sums of elements in `group_b`, `group_c` respectively; `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are the same as before.**
