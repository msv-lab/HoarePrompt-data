The code `sum_c = sum(group_c)` calculates the sum of the elements in `group_c` and assigns it to `sum_c`. Since `group_c` consists of the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` in their original order, the value of `sum_c` is the sum of these elements. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\), `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are updated to the integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers read from the user and sorted in descending order, `_` is 1, `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order), `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order), `group_c` is the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order), `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`.**
