`x` is assigned the values from the input split into a list and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t`, `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `_`, and `x_1`, `x_2`, ..., `x_n` remain unchanged. The `x` list contains the integers input by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ na, nb, nc ≤ n-2, and `n_a` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, `x` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, `_` is 1**
