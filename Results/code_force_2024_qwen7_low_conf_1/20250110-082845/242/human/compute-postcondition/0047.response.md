The code snippet prints the elements of `group_b` using `map(str, group_b)` to convert each element to a string and then joining them with a space. However, the values of the elements in `group_b` themselves do not change. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`x` is sorted in descending order; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of the sorted `x`; `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of the sorted `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `nc` elements of the sorted `x` but in their new order (from index `na + nb` to the end); `_` is 2; `sum_a` is the sum of elements in `group_a`; `sum_b` is the sum of elements in `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of elements in `group_c` and remains unchanged.**
