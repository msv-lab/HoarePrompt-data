Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ na, nb, nc ≤ n-2, and `na + nb + nc = n`; `x` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9 sorted in descending order; `_` is 1; `group_a` is the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order); `group_b` is the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order); `group_c` is the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order); `sum_a` is the sum of the first `na` elements of `x` (in descending order); `sum_b` is the sum of the next `nb` elements of `x` (in their original order); `sum_c` is the sum of the last `n - na - nb` elements of `x` (in their original order); if `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c` and `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a` and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`, then the printed output is 'YES', `group_b` is printed in string form separated by spaces and the elements of `group_c` are printed in string form separated by spaces. Otherwise, the printed output is 'NO'.**
