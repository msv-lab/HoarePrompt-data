Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets across `n` days with constraints on daily purchase limits and subsequent price increases.
2. **Key Logic**:
   - If `k <= m`, the cheapest ticket price is sufficient since no subsequent price increase affects the purchase.
   - For larger `k`, the solution needs to strategically minimize costs by considering how many tickets can be bought each day without exceeding the daily limit and how those purchases affect future prices.
3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - **Sorting and Set Operations**: The code sorts the ticket prices and uses sets to track the relevant prices.
   - **Day-wise Purchase Strategy**: It iterates through the days, buying tickets up to the daily limit (`m`) until `k` tickets are accumulated.
   - **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation seems to correctly account for both the initial and subsequent price increases due to previous day's purchases.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handling when `k` is exactly divisible by `m` and when it leaves a remainder.
   - Ensuring the strategy considers the most efficient way to spend the budget while adhering to daily purchase limits.

Upon reviewing the logic and implementation, the provided program appears to correctly implement the required algorithm. The code handles all described scenarios and constraints effectively.

Correctness: **True**
