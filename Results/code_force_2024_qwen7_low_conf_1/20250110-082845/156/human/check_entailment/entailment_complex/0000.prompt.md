First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Example

Input

    5 5 5 5 5 5

Output

    10
    64
    1
    72
    
Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an integer read from input, `res` is the final accumulated result, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `c` is the final cumulative value of `c`, `i` is `n` if the loop executed at least once, `s` is a set of integers, `b` is a list of integers, the output is `min(a) * k` if `k <= m` for any iteration, otherwise, `res` is calculated based on the conditions described.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k` along with a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints one of two results:
1. If `k <= m`, it prints the product of the minimum value in `a` and `k`.
2. Otherwise, it constructs a subset `b` of size either `k // m` or `k // m + 1` based on the divisibility of `k` by `m`. It then iterates through `b`, accumulating a result `res` based on specific conditions involving elements of `b`, their indices, and a cumulative value `c`. Finally, it prints the accumulated result `res`.

The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `k` is exactly divisible by `m`, the subset `b` contains `k // m` elements.
- When `k` is not divisible by `m`, the subset `b` contains `k // m + 1` elements.
- If `k > m` and the maximum element in `b` is repeated multiple times, the function correctly handles the accumulation logic, considering the last occurrence of the maximum element separately.

Missing functionality:
- The code does not explicitly handle the case when `t` is 0, although it can be inferred that the function would not process any test cases in this scenario.
- There is no validation or handling for invalid input, such as non-integer values for `n`, `m`, `k`, or `a`.
