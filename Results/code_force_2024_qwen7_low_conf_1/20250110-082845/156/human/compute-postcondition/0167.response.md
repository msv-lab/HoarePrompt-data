The code initializes an empty list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `b` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is as before, `s` is as before, `b` is an empty list, `res` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `c` is as before, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s` is a set containing the first k // m elements of the sorted list `a`**
