Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted version of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 1 element from `a` that are also in `s`, `leng` is the number of elements in `b`, which is at least 1, `res` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, but `b[i] != mx` or `i != mx_ind_lt`.
