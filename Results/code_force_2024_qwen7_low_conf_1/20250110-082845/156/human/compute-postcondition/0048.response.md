The code `leng += 1` increments the value of `leng` by 1. Initially, `leng` is 1, so after the increment, `leng` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is 2, `k` and `m` are positive integers such that `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng + 1` is less than `k // m + 1`, `b` is `[a[1]]`**
