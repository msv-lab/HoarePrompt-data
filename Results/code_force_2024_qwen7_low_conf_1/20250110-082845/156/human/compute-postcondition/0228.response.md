The given code snippet `res += (b[i] + c) * m` modifies the variable `res`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The variable `res` is updated by adding to its current value the product of `(b[i] + c)` and `m`.
2. The variables `b`, `i`, `c`, and `m` are used in the calculation, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state.

Given that the exact values of `b[i]`, `c`, and `m` are not specified, we can only express `res` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`res` is updated to its current value plus \((b[i] + c) * m\), `b`, `i`, `c`, and `m` retain their original values.**
