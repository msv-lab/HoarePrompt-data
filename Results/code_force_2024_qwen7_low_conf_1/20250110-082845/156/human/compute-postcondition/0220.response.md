`c` is incremented by `k % m`. The initial value of `c` is 0, so `c` becomes `k % m`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is `k % m`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `mx * (k % m)`, `b` is unchanged, `i` is equal to `mx_ind_lt`, and `b[i]` is equal to `mx`.

Output State: **`c` is `k % m`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `mx * (k % m)`, `b` is unchanged, `i` is equal to `mx_ind_lt`, and `b[i]` is equal to `mx`.**
