The variable `leng` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is as before, `s` is as before, `b` is an empty list, `res` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `c` is as before, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s` is a set containing the first k // m elements of the sorted list `a`, and `leng` is 0.
