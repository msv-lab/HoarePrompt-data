`leng` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `leng` is 3. The value of `i` remains 2, `b` remains unchanged, `n` is still a positive integer, and the error message regarding `'a'` remains the same since no definition or usage of `a` is provided in the code.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `leng` is 3, `b` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, error: 'a' is not defined**
