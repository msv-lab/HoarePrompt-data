Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted version of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 1 element from `a` that are also in `s`, `leng` is the number of elements in `b`, which is at least 1, `res` is `(mx + c) * (k % m) + (b[i] + c) * m` if `b[i] == mx` and `i == mx_ind_lt`, otherwise `res` is `(mx + c) * (k % m)`, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of `mx` in `b`, and `c` is `c_initial + k % m` if `b[i] == mx` and `i == mx_ind_lt`, otherwise `c` is `c + m`; `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)`**
