Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of integers
- `s` is a set of integers
- `leng` is the minimum value between `k // m + 1` and `n`
- `b` is a list containing the first `leng` elements that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s`
- `c` is 0
- `res` is 0
- `mx` is the maximum value in `b`
- `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`

### For Loop:
The loop iterates over the range of `len(b)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is `n-1`.
   - Since `i` starts at `n-1`, the loop will not start executing because the range of the loop (`range(len(b))`) will not include `n-1` if `b` is empty or `len(b) < n`.

2. **Condition for the loop to start:**
   - For the loop to start, `len(b)` must be at least 1.
   - If `len(b) >= 1`, then the loop can start from `i = 0` up to `len(b) - 1`.

3. **Ensuring `b` is non-empty:**
   - To ensure that `b` contains at least one element, we need to check that there is at least one element in `b` such that `a[i] in s` for some `i` where `0 <= i < n`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop can execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `len(b)` must be at least 1.
- There must exist at least one element in `b` such that `a[i] in s` for some `i` where `0 <= i < n`.

Given these conditions, we can update the states as follows:

**State:**
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of integers
- `s` is a set of integers
- `leng` is the minimum value between `k // m + 1` and `n`
- `b` is a list containing the first `leng` elements that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` (with at least one such element)
- `c` is 0
- `res` is 0
- `mx` is the maximum value in `b`
- `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`
- `len(b)` must be at least 1

So, the final answer is:

**State:**
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of integers
- `s` is a set of integers
- `leng` is the minimum value between `k // m + 1` and `n`
- `b` is a list containing the first `leng` elements that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` (with at least one such element)
- `c` is 0
- `res` is 0
- `mx` is the maximum value in `b`
- `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`
- `len(b)` must be at least 1
