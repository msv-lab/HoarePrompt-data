The code `leng += 1` increments the value of `leng` by 1. Initially, `leng` is 2, so after executing this line, `leng` will be 3. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is 3, `k` and `m` are positive integers such that `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng + 1` is less than `k // m + 1`, `b` is `[a[1], a[2]]`**
