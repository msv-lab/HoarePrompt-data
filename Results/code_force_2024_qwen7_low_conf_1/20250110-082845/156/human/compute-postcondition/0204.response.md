Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is as before (unchanged).
   - `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`.
   - `b` is an empty list plus `a[3]` if `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`.
   - `leng` is either the count of elements added to `b` or 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - During each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` increases by 1.
   - If `i` is within the range specified by the loop, the loop body is executed.
   - The condition for adding `a[i]` to `b` is:
     - `a[i]` is in `s`.
     - `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `s` is still the same set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`.
   - `b` is either updated with `a[3]` if conditions are met or remains an empty list.
   - `leng` is either the count of elements added to `b` or 0.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is still within the range of the loop (`i < n`).

6. **Updated States**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `b` may be updated based on the new value of `i` and the conditions mentioned above.
   - `leng` will be updated based on whether `a[i]` was added to `b`.

Given the above steps, we can now determine the states needed for the next iteration:

- `t` is unchanged.
- `s` is unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `b` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and the conditions.
- `leng` will be updated based on whether `a[i]` was added to `b`.

Since `i` was previously 3, it will be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.

**State:**
- `t` is as before.
- `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`.
- `i` is 4.
- `b` is updated based on the new value of `i` and the conditions.
- `leng` is updated based on whether `a[4]` was added to `b`.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`t` is as before, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `i` is 4, `b` is updated based on the new value of `i` and the conditions, `leng` is updated based on whether `a[4]` was added to `b`.**
