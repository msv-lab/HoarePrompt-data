The code snippet `b.append(a[i])` attempts to append the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `b`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `a` or the specific value of `i`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the code would try to access `a[2]`.

Since the initial state only specifies that `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0, but does not provide the value of `a` or `b`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[2]` or the contents of `b` before this operation. The only change is that `b` will have its length increased by one, and the element at `b[-1]` (the last element in `b`) will be `a[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `b` has an additional element which is `a[2]`**
