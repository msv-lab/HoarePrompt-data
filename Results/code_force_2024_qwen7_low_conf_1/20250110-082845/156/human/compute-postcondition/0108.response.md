`c` is incremented by `m`. The value of `c` was initially `0`, so after adding `m`, the new value of `c` is `m`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `b` must contain at least one element, `leng < k // m`, `leng` is the count of elements added to `b`, `c` is `m`, `res` is `b[n] * m`**
