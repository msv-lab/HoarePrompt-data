Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is 2, `k` and `m` are positive integers such that `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng + 1` is less than `k // m + 1`, and `b` is `[a[1]]`. If `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m + 1`, then `leng` is set to 2 and `b` is set to `[a[1]]`. Otherwise, the condition does not change any variables.***
