The code snippet `res += (b[i] + c) * m` affects the following variables:
- `res` is incremented by `(b[i] + c) * m`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`.
- `b` must contain at least one element.
- `leng < k // m`.
- `leng` is the count of elements added to `b`.
- `c` is `0`.
- `res` is `0`.

Let's update the state:
- `res` is incremented by `(b[i] + c) * m`. Since `c` is `0`, this simplifies to `res += b[i] * m`.
- `i` remains `n`.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains `0`.
- `res` starts at `0` and is now incremented by `b[i] * m`.

Since `b[i]` is the i-th element in `b` and we know `i` is `n`, the updated state is:
- `i` is `n`.
- `b` must contain at least one element.
- `leng < k // m`.
- `leng` is the count of elements added to `b`.
- `c` is `0`.
- `res` is now `b[n] * m`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `b` must contain at least one element, `leng < k // m`, `leng` is the count of elements added to `b`, `c` is `0`, `res` is `b[n] * m`**.
