The code `mx = max(b)` tries to find the maximum value in the list `b`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `b`. Since `b` is not defined, the line `mx = max(b)` will raise a NameError because `b` is not defined. 

Given the initial state and the code, the variables `c` and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`c` is 0, `res` is 0**
