`leng` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value since it's not defined in the initial state. However, we know `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0. The output state will reflect that `leng` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `leng` is the original value plus 1**
