`b.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[0]` is in `s`, and `b` was not defined before this line, `b` will become a list containing `a[0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is an integer, `k` and `m` are positive integers such that `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`, `b` is `[a[0]]`**
