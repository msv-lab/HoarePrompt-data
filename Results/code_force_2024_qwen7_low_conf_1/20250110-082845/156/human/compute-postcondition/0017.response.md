The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `leng` may be incremented by 1
- `b` may contain \( a[0] \) if the condition was met, and \( a[i] \) is \( a[1] \)

From this, we know that `b` initially contains `a[0]` (if the condition was met), and now `b.append(a[i])` will append `a[1]` to `b`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `leng` may be incremented by 1
- `b` now contains both `a[0]` and `a[1]`

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `leng` may be incremented by 1, `b` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1]]`**
