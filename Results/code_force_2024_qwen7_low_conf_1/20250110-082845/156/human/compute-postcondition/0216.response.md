The code snippet `mx_ind_lt = max(i for i in range(len(b)) if b[i] == mx)` involves finding the maximum index `i` in the list `b` where `b[i]` is equal to `mx`. However, the variable `b` and `mx` are not defined in the given initial state. Since these variables are undefined, we cannot determine the exact value of `mx_ind_lt`.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`c` is 0, `res` is 0**
