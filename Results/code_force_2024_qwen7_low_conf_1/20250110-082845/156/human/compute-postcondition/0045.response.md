Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is incremented by 1, `k` and `m` are positive integers such that `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng + 1` is less than `k // m + 1`. If `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng + 1` is less than `k // m + 1`, then `b` is `[a[0]]`. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
