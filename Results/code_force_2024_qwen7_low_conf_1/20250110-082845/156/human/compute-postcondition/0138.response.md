Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `c` is 0
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `a` is a list of integers
- `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted version of `a`
- `b` is a list containing at most `k // m + 1` elements from `a` that are also in `s`
- `leng` is the number of elements in `b`, which is at most `k // m + 1`
- `res` is 0
- `mx` is the maximum value in `b`
- `mx_ind_lt` is the index of `mx` in `b`

### Loop Context:
The loop iterates over the indices of the list `b` using `range(len(b))`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `len(b)` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `b` contains at least one element for the loop to start.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - We know that `b` is a list containing at most `k // m + 1` elements from `a` that are also in `s`.
   - We also know that `leng` is the number of elements in `b`, which is at most `k // m + 1`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `b` could potentially be empty, we need to ensure that `b` has at least one element.
   - If `b` is empty, then `len(b)` would be 0, and the loop would not execute.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`c`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `res`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`) do not directly affect whether the loop starts or not. They might change during the loop execution but do not need adjustment for the loop to start.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, `b` must contain at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this condition.

### Final Answer:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted version of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 1 element from `a` that are also in `s`, `leng` is the number of elements in `b`, which is at least 1, `res` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of `mx` in `b`**
