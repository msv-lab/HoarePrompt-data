Postcondition: ***`c` is either `k % m` or `m`, `res` is either the original value of `res` plus `mx * (k % m)` or `b[0] * m`, `b` is unchanged except that the element at index `i` might be different, `i` is either `mx_ind_lt` or `0`, and `b[i]` is either equal to `mx` when `i` is `mx_ind_lt` or not equal to `mx` or `i` is not equal to `mx_ind_lt`***
