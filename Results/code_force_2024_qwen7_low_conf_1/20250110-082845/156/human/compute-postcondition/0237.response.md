Output State: **`c` is `k % m` or `c + k % m` depending on whether the loop executed and the conditions within the loop were met, `res` is the initial value of `res` plus the sum of `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` for each iteration where `b[i] == mx` and `i == mx_ind_lt`, or `(b[i] + c) * m` otherwise, `b` is unchanged, `i` is the last index processed by the loop, `i` is either `mx_ind_lt` or the last valid index in `b`, and `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` retain their original values.**
