`b.append(a[i])` adds the element `a[i]`, which is in set `s`, to the list `b`. The length of list `b` increases by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `a[i]` is in set `s`, length of some list `leng` is less than `k` divided by `m`, list `b` contains `a[i]`**
