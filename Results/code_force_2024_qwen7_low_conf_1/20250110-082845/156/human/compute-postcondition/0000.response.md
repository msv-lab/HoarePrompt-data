`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` is now an integer obtained from user input. The values of `t`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9), `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `n` is an integer obtained from user input.**
