`c` is incremented by `k % m`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial value of `c` can be expressed as `res / (mx + c)`, where `res = (mx + c) * (k % m)`. Since `c` is incremented by `k % m`, the new value of `c` is `res / (mx + c) + k % m`.

To express this more clearly, let's denote the initial value of `c` as `c_initial`. Thus, the updated value of `c` is `c_initial + k % m`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted version of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 1 element from `a` that are also in `s`, `leng` is the number of elements in `b`, which is at least 1, `res` is `(mx + c) * (k % m)`, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of `mx` in `b`, and the current value of `b[i]` is equal to `mx` and `i` is equal to `mx_ind_lt`, `c` is `c_initial + k % m`.**
