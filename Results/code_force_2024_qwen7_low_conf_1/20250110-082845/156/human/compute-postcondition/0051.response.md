`b.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `b` will append `a[2]` to itself. Since `a` is a list of integers, `a[2]` is an integer.

The initial state is:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers
- `s` is a set of integers
- `leng` is 2
- `k` and `m` are positive integers such that `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng + 1` is less than `k // m + 1`
- `b` is `[a[1]]`

After executing the code `b.append(a[i])`:
- `b` will be `[a[1], a[2]]` because `b` initially was `[a[1]]` and now it appends `a[2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is 2, `k` and `m` are positive integers such that `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng + 1` is less than `k // m + 1`, `b` is `[a[1], a[2]]`**
