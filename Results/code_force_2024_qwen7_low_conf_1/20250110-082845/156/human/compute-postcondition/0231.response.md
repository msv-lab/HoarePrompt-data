Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: We need to understand the state at the end of the previous iteration of the for loop.
   - `res` is updated based on specific conditions.
   - `b[i]` is checked against `mx` and `i` against `mx_ind_lt`.
   - If the condition `b[i] == mx` and `i == mx_ind_lt` is met, `res` is updated as per the given formula.
   - Otherwise, `res` is incremented by `(b[i] + c) * m`.

2. **Key Variables**:
   - `b`: The list being iterated over.
   - `i`: The index of the current element in the list.
   - `mx`: The maximum value in the list `b`.
   - `mx_ind_lt`: The index of the maximum value in the list `b`.
   - `res_initial`, `b_i_initial`, `c_initial`, `k_initial`, `m_initial`: Initial values used in the update formula.
   - `res`: The cumulative result updated during each iteration.
   - `c`: Incremented by `m` if the condition is not met.
   - `m`: Retains its original value.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range of `len(b)`.
   - For each iteration, the condition checks whether `b[i]` equals `mx` and `i` equals `mx_ind_lt`.
   - If the condition is true, `res` is updated using the given formula.
   - If the condition is false, `res` is incremented by `(b[i] + c) * m`, and `c` is incremented by `m`.

4. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Assume the loop has just completed an iteration with some `i` value.
   - `b[i]` might or might not equal `mx` and `i` might or might not equal `mx_ind_lt`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue to the next index `i+1`.
   - We need to adjust the state such that it reflects the new index and potential changes in `res`.

Given the information from the previous iteration:
- Let's assume the loop has just finished with `i` being the current index.
- If the condition was met, `res` would have been updated according to the formula.
- If the condition was not met, `res` would have been incremented by `(b[i] + c) * m`, and `c` would have been incremented by `m`.

### Adjusted States for Next Iteration:
- The index `i` will be incremented by 1, so the next iteration will start with `i = i + 1`.
- `res` will retain its updated value unless the condition is met again.
- `c` will be incremented by `m` if the condition was not met in the previous iteration.
- `m` will retain its original value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`res` retains its updated value, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is `c + m`, and `m` retains its original value.**
