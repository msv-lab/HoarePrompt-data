`res` is incremented by the value of `(b[i] + c) * m`. Given the initial state where `c` is 0, `res` is 0, `b` has at least one element, `i` is 0, and `b[i]` is not equal to `mx` or `i` is not equal to `mx_ind_lt`, the expression simplifies to `res += b[i] * m`.

Since `c` is 0, the equation further simplifies to `res += b[i] * m`. 

Therefore, the updated value of `res` is `b[0] * m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is 0, `res` is `b[0] * m`, `b` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `b[i]` is not equal to `mx` or `i` is not equal to `mx_ind_lt`**
