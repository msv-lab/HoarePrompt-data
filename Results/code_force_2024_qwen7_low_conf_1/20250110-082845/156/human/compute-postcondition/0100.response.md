The code snippet `b.append(a[i])` attempts to append the element at index `i` from list `a` to list `b`. However, there are a few issues here:
- The variable `a` is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet.
- The variable `b` is also not defined initially.

Given the provided initial state (`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0) and the lack of definition for `a` and `b`, the code will raise an error because `a` and `b` are undefined. Since the code cannot be executed as written due to these undefined variables, no variables change their values.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0**
