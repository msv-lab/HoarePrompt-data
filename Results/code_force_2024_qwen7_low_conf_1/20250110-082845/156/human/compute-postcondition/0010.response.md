The line `leng = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leng`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, or `b`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input and \(n > 0\); `k` is divisible by `m`; `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`; and `b` is an empty list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input and \(n > 0\); `k` is divisible by `m`; `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`; `b` is an empty list; `leng` is 0.**
