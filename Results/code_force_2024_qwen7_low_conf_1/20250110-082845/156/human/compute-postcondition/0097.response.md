`leng` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` and `i` remains unchanged, and the additional element in `b` is `a[2]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `b` has an additional element which is `a[2]`; `leng` is `leng` + 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `b` has an additional element which is `a[2]`; `leng` is `leng` + 1**
