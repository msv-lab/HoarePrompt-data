`a` is assigned the value of a list created by converting the input split by spaces into integers. The input is taken using `input().split()`, which reads a line of space-separated integers and splits them into a list of strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string to an integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is as before, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `s` is as before, `b` is as before, `c` is as before, `res` is as before, `leng` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
