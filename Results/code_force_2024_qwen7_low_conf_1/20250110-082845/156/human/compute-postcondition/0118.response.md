The code `b = []` initializes an empty list for `b`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted version of `a`, `b` is an empty list, `c` is as before, `res` is as before, `leng` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `k % m != 0`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted version of `a`, `b` is an empty list, `c` is as before, `res` is as before, `leng` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `k % m != 0**
