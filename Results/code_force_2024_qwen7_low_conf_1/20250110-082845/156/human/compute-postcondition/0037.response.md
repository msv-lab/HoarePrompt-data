Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer such that \(k > m\) and \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n \cdot m, 10^9)\); `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from user input and \(n > 0\); \(k \% m \neq 0\)**
