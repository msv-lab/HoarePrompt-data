`c` is incremented by `m`. The previous value of `c` was 0, so now `c` is `0 + m`, which simplifies to `c` is `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `b` must contain at least one element, `leng` is the final count of such elements, `s` is the set of the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `m` is an integer, `c` is `m`, and `res` is `b[i] * m`**
