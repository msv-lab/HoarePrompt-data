Postcondition: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is the minimum value between `k // m + 1` and `n`, `b` is a list containing the first `leng` elements that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` (with at least one such element), `c` is 0, `res` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, and the current value of each element in `b` satisfies the condition `b[i] == mx` and `i == mx_ind_lt`.**
