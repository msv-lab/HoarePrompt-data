`leng` is incremented by 1, changing its value from the original value (less than `k // m + 1`) to `leng + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is `leng + 1`, `k` and `m` are positive integers such that `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng + 1` is less than `k // m + 1`, `b` is `[a[0]]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is `leng + 1`, `k` and `m` are positive integers such that `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng + 1` is less than `k // m + 1`, `b` is `[a[0]]`**
