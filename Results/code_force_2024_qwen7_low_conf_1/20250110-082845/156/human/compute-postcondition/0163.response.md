The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This affects the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Since the input is not provided in the example, let's denote the inputs as follows:
- `n` is now an integer read from the input.
- `m` is now an integer read from the input.
- `k` is now an integer read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `b`, `res`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `c`, `i`) retain their original values.

The condition `min(a) * k` if `k <= m` or the subsequent loop logic depends on the values of `k` and `m`, but since those values are not provided, we will just note that the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated.

Output State: **`t` is as before, `s` is as before, `b` is as before, `res` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `c` is as before, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input**
