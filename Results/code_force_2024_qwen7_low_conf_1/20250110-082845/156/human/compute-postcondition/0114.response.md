`c` is incremented by `m`. The previous value of `c` was `2 * m`, so now `c` is `2 * m + m` which simplifies to `3 * m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + 1`, `b` contains at least one element, `leng < k // m`, `c` is `3 * m`, `res` is `3 * b[n+1] * m + 3 * m^2`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `b` contains at least one element, `leng < k // m`, `c` is `3 * m`, `res` is `3 * b[n+1] * m + 3 * m^2`**
