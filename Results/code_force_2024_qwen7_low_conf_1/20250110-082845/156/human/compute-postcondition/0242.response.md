The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case `i` (where \(1 \leq i \leq t\)), there are additional parameters:
  - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\).
  - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n \cdot m, 10^9)\).
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\).

The function does not return a specific value directly but processes `t` test cases, each involving `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case `i` (where \(1 \leq i \leq t\)), it accepts integers `n`, `m`, `k` with specified constraints and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs without returning a direct value.**
