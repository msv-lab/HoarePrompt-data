The code `c += m` increments the value of `c` by `m`. Given the initial state where `c` is `2 * val_b1 * m + c * m + m`, the new value of `c` will be updated to `(2 * val_b1 * m + c * m + m) + m`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `b` contains at least one element, `c` is `(2 * val_b1 * m + c * m + m) + m`, `res` is `res + (val_b2 + c) * m`**
