The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 3, and `a[i]` is in `s`, which means `a[3]` is one of the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted list `a` (since `a[i]` is in `s`). The value of `b` is updated by adding `a[3]` to it.

Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the output state includes the updated list `b` with the new element appended, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is as before, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is an empty list plus `a[3]`, `res` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `c` is as before, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `leng` is 0.**
