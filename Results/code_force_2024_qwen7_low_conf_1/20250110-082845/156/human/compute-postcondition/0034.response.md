`res` is incremented by the value of `(b[i] + c) * m`. The values of `b[i]`, `c`, and `m` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain as their respective values. The output state updates the value of `res` accordingly.

Output State: **`res` is `res` + (b[i] + c) * m, `b[i]` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged**
