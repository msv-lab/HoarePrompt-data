Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` must contain at least one element
   - `c` is \(2 * b[1] * m + c * m + m\)

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range of the length of `b`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < len(b)`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute again if `i` is 2.
   - Therefore, we need to set `i` to 2.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is now 2, the condition `i < len(b)` will depend on the value of `len(b)`.
   - `b` must still contain at least one element.
   - The expression for `c` does not change because it depends on the values of `b` and `m`, which remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body (which is omitted).

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `b` must contain at least one element
   - `c` remains \(2 * b[1] * m + c * m + m\)

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `b` must contain at least one element, `c` is \(2 * b[1] * m + c * m + m\)**
