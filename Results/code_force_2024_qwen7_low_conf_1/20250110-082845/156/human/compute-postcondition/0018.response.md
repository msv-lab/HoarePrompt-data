`leng` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` must remain greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `b` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1]]`. The only change is that `leng` is now 1 more than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `leng` is 1, `b` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1]]`**
