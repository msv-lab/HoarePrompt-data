`c` is incremented by `m`. The values of `b[i]`, `c`, and `m` are updated accordingly. The initial state's expression for `res` remains the same because the code does not directly modify `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is `res` + (b[i] + c) * m, `b[i]` remains unchanged, `c` is increased by `m`, `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is `res` + (b[i] + c) * m, `b[i]` remains unchanged, `c` is increased by `m`, `m` remains unchanged**
