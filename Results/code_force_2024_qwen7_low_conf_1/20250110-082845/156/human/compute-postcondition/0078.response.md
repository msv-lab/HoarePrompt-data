Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is the minimum value between `k // m + 1` and `n`, `b` is a list containing the first `leng` elements that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` (with at least one such element), `c` is either `c + 3 * (k % m)` or `m + 2 * (k % m)` or `c + m`, `res` is updated to either `res + (b[i] + c) * (k % m)` or `(b[i] + c) * m`, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `len(b)` remains at least 1.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, including both the if and else parts, while maintaining the conditions specified in the preconditions.
