The value of `leng` is incremented by 1. Initially, `leng` is `n + 1`. After the code executes, `leng` becomes `(n + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 2`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `b`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `k`, and `m`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` is `[a[1]]`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set, `leng` is `n + 2`, `k` and `m` are non-negative integers with `m` not equal to 0.**
