Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `b` is an empty list, `leng` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is in `s` and the current value of `leng` is less than `k // m`**.
