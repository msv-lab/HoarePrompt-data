The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the element `a[1]` (the second element in the list `a`) is appended to `b`.

- `i` remains unchanged at 1.
- `n` is a non-negative integer and is not affected.
- `a` is a list of integers and its elements are not altered.
- `s` is a set and is not affected.
- `leng` is `n + 1` and is not affected.
- `k` and `m` are non-negative integers with `m` not equal to 0, and these variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` is `[a[1]]`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set, `leng` is `n + 1`, `k` and `m` are non-negative integers with `m` not equal to 0.**
