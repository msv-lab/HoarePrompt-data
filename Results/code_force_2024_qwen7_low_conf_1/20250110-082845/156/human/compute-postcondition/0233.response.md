`c` is incremented by `k % m`. The values of `res`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * (k % m)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is `c + k % m`, and `m` retains its original value.

Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * (k % m)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is `c + k % m`, and `m` retains its original value.**
