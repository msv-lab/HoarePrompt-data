The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables, but it sets `c` to 0. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `b` contains the elements from `a` that are in `s` and whose index `i` satisfies `leng < k // m`, `leng` is the final count of such elements, `s` is the set of the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `m` is an integer, and `c` is 0.**
