The value of `c` is incremented by `m`. The initial state is `i` is `n` but less than `len(b)`, `b` contains at least one element, `leng < k // m`, `c` is `m`, `res` is `2 * b[n] * m + m^2`. After executing `c += m`, the value of `c` changes to `m + m`.

Output State: **`i` is `n` but less than `len(b)`, `b` contains at least one element, `leng < k // m`, `c` is `2 * m`, `res` is `2 * b[n] * m + m^2`**
