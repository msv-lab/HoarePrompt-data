Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set, `leng` is `n + 1`, `k` and `m` are non-negative integers with `m` not equal to 0. If `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m + 1`, then `leng` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
