`res` is assigned the value of `res` plus `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, the value of `c` is incremented by `m`, and `m` retains its original value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * (k % m)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is `c + m`, and `m` retains its original value.**
