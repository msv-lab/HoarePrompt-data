`res` is updated by adding `(b[i] + c) * m` to its current value. From the initial state, `i` is `n + 1`, `b` contains at least one element, `leng < k // m`, `c` is `2 * m`, and `res` is `2 * b[n+1] * m + m^2`.

Let's calculate the new value of `res`:
- `b[i]` becomes `b[n + 1]`.
- `c` remains `2 * m`.
- So, `(b[i] + c) * m` becomes \((b[n + 1] + 2 * m) * m\).

Therefore, the new value of `res` is:
\[ res = (2 * b[n+1] * m + m^2) + (b[n + 1] + 2 * m) * m \]
\[ res = 2 * b[n+1] * m + m^2 + b[n + 1] * m + 2 * m^2 \]
\[ res = 3 * b[n+1] * m + 3 * m^2 \]

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `b` contains at least one element, `leng < k // m`, `c` is `2 * m`, `res` is `3 * b[n+1] * m + 3 * m^2`**
