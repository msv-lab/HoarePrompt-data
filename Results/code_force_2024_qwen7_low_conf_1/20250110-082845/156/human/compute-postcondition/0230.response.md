Postcondition: ***`res` is updated according to the following rules: if `b[i] == mx` and `i == mx_ind_lt`, then `res = res_initial + (b_i_initial + c_initial) * (k_initial % m_initial)`, where `b[i] = b_i_initial`, `c = c_initial + (k_initial % m_initial)`, and `k = k_initial`. Otherwise, `res` is updated to its current value plus `(b[i] + c) * m`, where `b` retains its original value, `i` retains its original value, `c` is incremented by `m`, and `m` retains its original value.***
