`res` is initially equal to `b[1] * m`. The code updates `res` by adding `(b[i] + c) * m` to its current value. Since `i` is 1, the term `(b[i] + c) * m` simplifies to `(b[1] + c) * m`.

Let's update the value of `res`:

Initial value of `res`: `b[1] * m`

After the operation: 
\[ res = b[1] * m + (b[1] + c) * m \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ res = b[1] * m + b[1] * m + c * m \]
\[ res = 2 * b[1] * m + c * m \]

Therefore, the updated value of `res` is \(2 * b[1] * m + c * m\).

Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` must contain at least one element, `res` is \(2 * b[1] * m + c * m\)**
