The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `c`, `res`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is as before, `a` is as before, `s` is as before, `b` is as before, `c` is as before, `res` is as before, `leng` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
