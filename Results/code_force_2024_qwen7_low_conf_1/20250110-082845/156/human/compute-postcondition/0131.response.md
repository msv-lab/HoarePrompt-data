The code `leng += 1` increments the value of `leng` by 1. Given that the initial value of `leng` is `n + 1`, after executing this line, `leng` will become `(n + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is a non-negative integer; `a` is a list of integers; `s` is a set; `leng` is `n + 2`; `k` and `m` are non-negative integers with `m` not equal to 0; `b` is a list with an additional element `a[2]`**
