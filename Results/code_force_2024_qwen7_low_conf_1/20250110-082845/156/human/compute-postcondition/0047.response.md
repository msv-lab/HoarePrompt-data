The code appends the element `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the element `a[1]` is appended to `b`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is 1, `k` and `m` are positive integers such that `a[0]` is in `s` and `leng + 1` is less than `k // m + 1`, `b` is `[a[1]]`**
