`leng` is incremented by 1, which means the length of the list `leng` increases by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is an element of set `s`, `b` contains the element `a[i]`, length of some list `leng` is less than integer `k` divided by integer `m`, `leng` is now `leng` + 1**
