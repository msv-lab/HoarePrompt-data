The code reads a list of integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is split into individual elements and each element is converted to an integer, which is then stored in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `b`, `res`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `c`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is as before, `s` is as before, `b` is as before, `res` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `c` is as before, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input**
