The code `print(min(a) * k)` calculates the minimum value in the list `a` and multiplies it by `k`. The result is printed but not stored in a variable. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is as before, `s` is as before, `b` is as before, `res` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `c` is as before, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, the minimum value of `a` multiplied by `k` is printed.**
