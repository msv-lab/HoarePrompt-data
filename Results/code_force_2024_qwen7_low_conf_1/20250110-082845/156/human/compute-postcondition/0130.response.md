`b` is appended with the element `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2; `n` is a non-negative integer; `a` is a list of integers; `s` is a set; `leng` is `n + 1`; `k` and `m` are non-negative integers with `m` not equal to 0; `b` is a list with an additional element `a[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is a non-negative integer; `a` is a list of integers; `s` is a set; `leng` is `n + 1`; `k` and `m` are non-negative integers with `m` not equal to 0; `b` is a list with an additional element `a[2]`**
