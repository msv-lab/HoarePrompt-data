`res` is assigned the value of `(b[i] + c) * m`. Since `i` is 0, `b[i]` refers to the first element in list `b`. There are no specific values given for `c` and `m`, so they remain as they are. The value of `res` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `b` must contain at least one element, `res` is `(b[0] + c) * m`**
