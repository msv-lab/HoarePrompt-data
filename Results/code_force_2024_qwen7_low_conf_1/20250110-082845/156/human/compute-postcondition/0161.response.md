Postcondition: ***`t` is as before, `s` is as before, `b` is a list containing at most `k // m + 1` elements from `a` that are also in `s`, `res` is the sum of the contributions from each element in `b` based on the conditions described, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of `mx` in `b`, `c` is `len(b) * m` if the loop executes, otherwise `0`, `i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the output is `min(a) * k` if `k <= m`. Otherwise, the output is determined by the loop execution and the conditions specified for `b`, `res`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, and `c`.***
