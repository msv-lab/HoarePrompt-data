Postcondition: **`i` is 2; `n` is a non-negative integer; `a` is a list of integers; `s` is a set; `leng` is `n + 2`; `k` and `m` are non-negative integers with `m` not equal to 0; if `a[2]` is in `s` and `n + 1 < k / m + 1`, then `leng` remains `n + 2`. Otherwise, the condition does not affect the value of `leng`.**
