According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the conditions in the problem statement, we need to ensure that the loop continues as long as `i < n`. Since `n` must be at least 4, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, and `i` must be less than `n`**
