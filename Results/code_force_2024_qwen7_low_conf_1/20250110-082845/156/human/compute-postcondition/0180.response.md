`leng` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains at least 4, and `i` is still less than `n - 1`. The value of `b` is unchanged, as the code does not modify it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `b` contains the value of `a[i]` appended to it; `leng` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `b` contains the value of `a[i]` appended to it; `leng` is incremented by 1.**
