Postcondition: ***`t`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `n`, `s`, `b`, `c`, `res`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt` are as follows:
- If `k % m == 0`, then `i` is `len(b)`, `b` contains all elements from `a` that are also in `s`, `res` is the sum of all elements in `b` multiplied by `m` and incremented by the cumulative value of `c`, `c` is increased by `len(b) * m`, and `m` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is the minimum value between `k // m + 1` and `n`, `b` is a list containing the first `leng` elements that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` (with at least one such element), `c` is either `c + (k % m) * len(b)` or `m * len(b)`, `res` is updated to either `res + (b[i] + c) * (k % m)` or `(b[i] + c) * m` for each iteration, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, and `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`.***
