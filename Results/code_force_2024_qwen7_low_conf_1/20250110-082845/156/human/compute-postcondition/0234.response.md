`res` is assigned the value of `res + (b[i] + c) * m`. The value of `b[i] + c` is added to `res`, and then multiplied by `m`. The values of `i` and `c` are updated to `i + 1` and `c + m` respectively, and `m` retains its original value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is `c + m`, and `m` retains its original value.**
