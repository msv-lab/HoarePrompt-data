`c` is incremented by `m`. The previous state shows that `res` was updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`, `i` was updated to `i + 1`, and `c` was updated to `c + m`. Since the code only increments `c` by `m`, the values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is `c + m`, and `c` is incremented by `m`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is `c + m`, and `c` is incremented by `m`.**
