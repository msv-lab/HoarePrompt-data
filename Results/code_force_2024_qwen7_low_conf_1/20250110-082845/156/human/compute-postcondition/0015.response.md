Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is an element of set `s` and the length of some list `leng` is less than `k` divided by `m`, then `leng` is incremented by 1 and `b` contains the element `a[i]`. If the condition `a[i] in s and leng < k // m` is not satisfied, the values of `n`, `i`, `leng`, `b`, and `a[i]` remain unchanged.***
