Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is a set of integers, `leng` is the minimum value between `k // m + 1` and `n`, `b` is a list containing the first `leng` elements that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` (with at least one such element), `c` is either `c + (k % m)` or `m`, `res` is either `res + mx * (k % m)` or `b[i] * m`, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, and `len(b)` is at least 1.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts, ensuring that the overall state of the program variables is accurately described after the if-else block executes.
