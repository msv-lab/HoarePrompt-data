Postcondition: **`i` is either `len(b) - 1` if the loop executes (and `k % m == 0`) or `n`; `b` is a list containing at most `k // m + 1` elements from `a` that are also in `s`; `res` is the sum of the contributions from each element in `b` based on the conditions described; `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of `mx` in `b`, and `c` is the final value of `c` which is `len(b) * m` if the loop executes, otherwise `0`.**
