`res` is assigned the value of itself plus the product of `(b[i] + c)` and `(k % m)`. Given that `c` is 0, `b[i]` is equal to `mx`, and `i` is equal to `mx_ind_lt`, the expression simplifies to `res += mx * (k % m)`. Since `c` is 0, the value of `b[i]` does not change.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `res` is updated to its original value plus `mx * (k % m)`
- `c` remains 0
- `b` remains unchanged
- `i` remains equal to `mx_ind_lt`
- `b[i]` is still equal to `mx`

Output State: **`c` is 0, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `mx * (k % m)`, `b` is unchanged, `i` is equal to `mx_ind_lt`, and `b[i]` is equal to `mx`.**
