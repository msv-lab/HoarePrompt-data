Postcondition: ***`t` is as before, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `res` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `c` is as before, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `leng` is 0. The current value of `leng` is less than `k // m + 1` and `a[i]` is in `s`.***
