The code `print(min(a) * k)` prints the minimum value of the list `a` multiplied by the integer `k`. The variables `a`, `min(a)`, and `k` are affected.

- `min(a)` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
- `k` is an input integer.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `b`, `c`, `res`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

After executing the code, the output will be the minimum value of `a` multiplied by `k`. However, since the exact values of `a` and `k` are not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the output. We can only state that the output will be `min(a) * k`.

Output State: **`t` is as before, `s` is as before, `b` is as before, `c` is as before, `res` is as before, `leng` is as before, `mx` is as before, `mx_ind_lt` is as before, `i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the output is `min(a) * k`**
