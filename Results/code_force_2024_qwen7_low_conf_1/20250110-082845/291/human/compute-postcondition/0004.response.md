`res` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 0 according to the initial state. Therefore, `res` is updated to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is a digit less than 5**
