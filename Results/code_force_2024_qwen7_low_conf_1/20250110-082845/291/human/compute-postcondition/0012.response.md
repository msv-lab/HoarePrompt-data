`res` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `res` is 2, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `res` is 2, and `i` is 2**
