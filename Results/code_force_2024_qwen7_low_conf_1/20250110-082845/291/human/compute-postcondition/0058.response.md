The code updates `_sum` by adding `a[i]` to `_sum` and then taking the maximum of 0 and the resulting sum. Given the initial state:

- `_sum` is `max(0, a[1])`
- `_max` is `max(0, a[1])`
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 1

The code sets `_sum = max(0, _sum + a[i])`. Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`.

Let's calculate the new value of `_sum`:

1. `_sum` initially is `max(0, a[1])`.
2. Adding `a[2]` to `_sum`: `_sum + a[2]`.
3. Taking the maximum of 0 and the above sum: `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])`.

Therefore, `_sum` becomes `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])`.

The other variables (`_max`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])`, `_max` is `max(0, a[1])`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
