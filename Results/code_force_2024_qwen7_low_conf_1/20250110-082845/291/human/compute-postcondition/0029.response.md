The code `_max = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `_max`. This means that the current maximum value `_max` was previously assigned based on some condition or calculation, but now it is explicitly set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **_sum is 0, _max is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `t` is the new value read from the standard input, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input, `_acc` is the new value of \(((k-1) \cdot _max) \% 10\), `i` remains \(k-1\)**
