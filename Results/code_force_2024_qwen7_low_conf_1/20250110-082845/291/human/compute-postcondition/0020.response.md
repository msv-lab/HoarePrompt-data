The code updates the value of `_acc` by adding `(_acc + _max) % MOD`. The previous value of `_acc` is `_max % 10`. Since `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` across all iterations of the loop, and `_sum` is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and considering each element of `a` up to index `n-1`, `_max` is the highest value of `_sum` during the loop. 

The new value of `_acc` is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{_acc} = (\text{_acc} + \text{_max}) \% \text{MOD} \]
Given that \(\text{MOD} = 10\), we need to take the result modulo 10.

Since `_acc` was initially `_max % 10`, the updated value of `_acc` is:
\[ \text{_acc} = ((\text{_max} \% 10) + \text{_max}) \% 10 \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
\_sum is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and considering each element of `a` up to index `n-1`, \_max is the maximum value of \_sum across all iterations of the loop, n is the number of iterations (which is the same as the length of the list `a` up to the n-th index), k is greater than 0, t is the original value read from the standard input, a is a list of integers where each element satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), MOD is 10, \_acc is \((\text{_max} \% 10 + \text{_max}) \% 10\), i is 1.
Output State: **\_sum is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and considering each element of `a` up to index `n-1`, \_max is the maximum value of \_sum across all iterations of the loop, n is the number of iterations (which is the same as the length of the list `a` up to the n-th index), k is greater than 0, t is the original value read from the standard input, a is a list of integers where each element satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), MOD is 10, \_acc is \((\text{_max} \% 10 + \text{_max}) \% 10\), i is 1.**
