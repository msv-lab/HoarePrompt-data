Output State: **_sum is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and adding elements of `a` up to index `n-1`, _max is the maximum value between `_sum` and the initial `_max`, `i` is `k`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `_acc` is ((_acc + _max) % MOD)^(k-n), `n` must be less than `k`**

### Explanation:
- **_sum**: This remains the same throughout the loop since the loop itself does not modify `_sum`. It is initialized as the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and adding elements of `a` up to index `n-1`.
- **_max**: This also remains unchanged as the loop does not directly modify `_max`. It retains its initial value.
- **i**: This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration. After `k` iterations, `i` will be `n + k`, but since the loop increments `i` only once per iteration and starts from `n`, after `k` iterations, `i` will be `n + k`, which simplifies to `k` when considering the loop's effect.
- **n**: This remains a positive integer and is unchanged by the loop.
- **k**: This is an input integer and remains unchanged.
- **a**: This list of integers remains unchanged by the loop.
- **_acc**: The value of `_acc` after each iteration is determined by the expression `(_acc + _max) % MOD`. Since the loop runs `k` times, the final value of `_acc` will be the result of this expression raised to the power of `k-n`.

Given these observations, the final state of the loop after executing `k` times (or fewer if `n` is not less than `k`) is as described above.
