The code updates `_sum` to be the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. Since the value of `a[i]` is not given, we cannot determine the exact value of `_sum` after the operation. However, we know that `_sum` will be at least 0 because of the `max(0, ...)` function.

The initial conditions are:
- `_sum` is 0
- `_max` is 0
- `n` must be greater than \(k-1\)
- `i` is \(k\)

After executing the code:
- `_sum` is updated to `max(0, 0 + a[k])`, which simplifies to `max(0, a[k])`. This means `_sum` will be 0 if `a[k]` is less than or equal to 0, or `a[k]` if `a[k]` is greater than 0.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_sum` is `max(0, a[k])`, `_max` is 0, `n` must be greater than \(k-1\), `i` is \(k\)**
