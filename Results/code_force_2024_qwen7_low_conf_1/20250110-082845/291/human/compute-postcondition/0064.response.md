The code initializes `_acc` to 0. This does not affect the values of `_sum`, `_max`, `i`, `n`, `k`, or `a`. The output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **_sum is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and adding elements of a up to index n-1, _max is the maximum value between _sum and the initial _max, i is n, n is a positive integer, k is an input integer, a is a list of integers, `_acc` is 0**
