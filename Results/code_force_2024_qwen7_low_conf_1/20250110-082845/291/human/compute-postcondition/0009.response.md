The code `break` does not affect any variable values and instead breaks out of the nearest loop or match case. Since there is no loop or match case in the given context, the only effect is that we break out of any such structure we might be inside. However, since no loop or match case was specified in the initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `res` is 1, and `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
