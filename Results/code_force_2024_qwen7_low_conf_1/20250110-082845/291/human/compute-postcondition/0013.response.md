The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `s`, `res`, and `i`. It simply breaks out of the nearest loop or switch-case structure, but since no such structure is present in the given code snippet, it only indicates the end of whatever control structure was there before this line.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `res` is 2, and `i` is 2**
