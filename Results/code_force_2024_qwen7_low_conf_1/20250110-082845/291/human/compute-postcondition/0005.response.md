The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no such loop or switch statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is a digit less than 5**
