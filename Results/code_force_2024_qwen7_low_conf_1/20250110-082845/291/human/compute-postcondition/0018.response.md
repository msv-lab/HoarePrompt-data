Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the index of the first digit in its string representation `s` that is less than 5, or -1 if no such digit exists. The function iterates through each digit of `n`, converting it to a string and checking if it is less than 5. If such a digit is found, the index is stored in `res` and the loop breaks. If no digit is found, `res` remains -1. The function does not rely on any external functions or inputs beyond `n`.**
