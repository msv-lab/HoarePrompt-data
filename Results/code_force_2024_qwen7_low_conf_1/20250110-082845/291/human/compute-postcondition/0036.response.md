Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `_sum` is `max(0, a[k])`
   - `_max` is `max(0, a[k])`
   - `n` must be greater than \(k-1\)
   - `i` is \(k\)

2. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to \(k\).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Updating the States:**
   - Since `i` was \(k\) at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to \(k+1\).
   - `n` must remain the same because the loop condition is based on `i < n`.

4. **Updating the Variables:**
   - `_sum` and `_max` are not directly affected by the loop, so they remain unchanged.
   - `i` is updated to \(k+1\).

5. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `_sum` remains `max(0, a[k])`
   - `_max` remains `max(0, a[k])`
   - `n` remains greater than \(k-1\)
   - `i` is now \(k+1\)

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`_sum` is max(0, a[k]), `_max` is max(0, a[k]), `n` must be greater than \(k-1\), `i` is \(k+1\)**
