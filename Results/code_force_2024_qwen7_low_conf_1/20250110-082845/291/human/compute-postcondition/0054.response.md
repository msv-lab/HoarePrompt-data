Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is defined by `range(n)`. This means the loop will run as long as `i < n`.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `_sum` is 0.
   - `_max` is 0.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, the initial value of `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is initially set to 1, the loop will only execute if `1 < n` or equivalently `n > 1`.

4. **Formulate the Final State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
