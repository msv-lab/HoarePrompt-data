According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_sum` is 0, `_max` is 0, `n` must be greater than \(k-1\), and `i` is \(k-1\).

For the loop to execute again, the following conditions must be met:
1. The value of `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes \(k\).
2. The value of `n` must still be greater than \(k-1\).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`_sum` is 0, `_max` is 0, `n` must be greater than \(k-1\), `i` is \(k\)**
