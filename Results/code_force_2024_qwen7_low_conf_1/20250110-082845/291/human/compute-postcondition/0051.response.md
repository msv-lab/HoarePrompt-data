The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variables `_acc` and `_max` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input**
