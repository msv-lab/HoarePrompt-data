According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])`, `_max` is `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]))`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The variable `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3.
- The condition `n > 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **_sum is max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]), _max is max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])), i is 3, n must be greater than 1**
