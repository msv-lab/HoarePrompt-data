Output State: **_sum is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and adding elements of a up to index n-1, _max is the maximum value between _sum and the initial _max, i is n, n is a positive integer, k is an input integer, a is a list of integers.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` from index 0 to index `n-1`.
- For each iteration, `_sum` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. This ensures that `_sum` is always non-negative.
- `_max` is updated to be the maximum of itself and `_sum`.
- After the loop completes, `_sum` will hold the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and adding elements of `a` up to index `n-1`.
- `_max` will hold the maximum value between this cumulative sum and its previous value.
- `i` will be `n` after the loop finishes, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
- Since the loop runs `n` times, `n` must be a positive integer.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), then:
- `_sum` remains 0.
- `_max` remains 0.
- `i` is still 0.
