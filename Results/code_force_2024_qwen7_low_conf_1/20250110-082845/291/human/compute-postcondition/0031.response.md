The code updates `_sum` to be the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. Given the initial state, the value of `_sum` is 0, and `i` is `k-1`. However, the value of `a[i]` is not provided. Therefore, the new value of `_sum` depends on the value of `a[k-1]`.

If `a[k-1]` is non-negative, `_sum` remains 0 because the maximum of 0 and a non-negative number is the non-negative number itself, but since `_sum` starts at 0, it will stay 0.

If `a[k-1]` is negative, `_sum` remains 0 because the maximum of 0 and a negative number is 0.

Since the value of `a[k-1]` is not specified, we consider both cases. However, in both cases, `_sum` does not change from its initial value.

The states of `_max`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`_sum` is 0, `_max` is 0, `n` must be greater than \(k-1\), `i` is \(k-1\)**
