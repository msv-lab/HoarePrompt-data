The code assigns the value 0 to `_max`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `_sum`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `_sum` is 0, `_max` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `_sum` is 0, `_max` is 0**
