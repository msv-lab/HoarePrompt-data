The code updates `_acc` by adding the value of `_acc + _max` modulo `MOD`. Since the exact value of `_acc` is not given, let's denote the updated value of `_acc` as `_acc_new`.

Given the initial state:
- `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `_acc` is updated but its exact value is not known

After executing the code:
- `_acc` is updated to `_acc_new`, which is `_acc + (_acc + _max) % MOD`

The output state is:
Output State: **_sum is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`, _max is the maximum value of _sum during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to k, i is `n - 2`, _acc is updated to `_acc + (_acc + _max) % MOD`**
