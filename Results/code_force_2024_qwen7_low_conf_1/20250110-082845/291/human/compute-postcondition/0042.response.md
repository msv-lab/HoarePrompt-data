Let's break down the given code and its impact on the variables:

1. Initial State:
   - `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`.
   - `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `_acc` is 0.

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   _acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD
   ```

   - The variable `_acc` is updated by adding to it the result of `(_acc + _max) % MOD`. Here, `MOD` is assumed to be a predefined constant, but since its specific value is not provided, we will keep it as `MOD`.

   Let's calculate the new value of `_acc`:
   - Initially, `_acc` is 0.
   - The expression `(_acc + _max) % MOD` simplifies to `_max % MOD` because `_acc` is 0.
   - Therefore, `_acc` becomes `_max % MOD`.

3. Post-Execution State:
   - `_sum` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the computation.
   - `_max` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the computation.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the computation.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the computation.
   - `_acc` is now `_max % MOD`.

Output State: **_sum is the maximum subarray sum starting from k-1 to n-1, _max is the maximum value of _sum during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to k, i is n, _acc is _max % MOD**.
