The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function does not directly return a value based on `n` alone but rather computes something based on an additional function or input (not shown in the provided function definition). The output of the function is `res`, which is the index of the first digit in string `s` that is less than 5 or remains -1 if no such digit exists.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the index of the first digit in string `s` that is less than 5, or -1 if no such digit exists.
