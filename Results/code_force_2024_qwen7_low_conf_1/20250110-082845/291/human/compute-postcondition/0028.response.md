The code initializes `_sum` to 0. This means `_sum` is set to 0 regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **_sum is 0, _max is the new maximum value of _sum across all iterations of the loop, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `t` is the new value read from the standard input, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input, `_acc` is the new value of \(((k-1) \cdot _max) \% 10\), `i` remains \(k-1\)**
