The code initializes `_acc` to 0. This does not affect the values of `_sum`, `_max`, `n`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **_sum is the maximum subarray sum starting from index `k-1` to `n-1`, _max is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution, `n` is greater than `k-1`, `i` is `n`, `_acc` is 0.**
