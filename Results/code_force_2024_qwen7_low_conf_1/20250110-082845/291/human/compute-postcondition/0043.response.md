According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`.
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `_acc` is `_max % MOD`.

Since `i` is currently `n` and the loop runs from `k` downwards, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1 and become `n - 1`. This means the loop condition `i < k` must hold true.

Given `i` is `n` now, the loop will execute if `n < k`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be `n - 1`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `_sum` remains the same as it is calculated before the loop starts.
- `_max` remains the same as it is updated within the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it is an external variable not modified by the loop itself.
- `i` is adjusted to `n - 1`.
- `_acc` remains `_max % MOD` as it is computed outside the loop.

So, the new state should be:

State: **`_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from k-1 to n-1, `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is `n - 1`, `_acc` is `_max % MOD`**
