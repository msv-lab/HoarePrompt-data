Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`.
   - `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `_acc` is `_acc + _max` modulo `MOD`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range `range(k)`.

3. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be within the range `range(k)`.
   - Since `i` starts from `n - 1`, it needs to become `n - 2` for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `n - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `_sum` and `_max` values remain the same because they are not updated in this loop iteration.
   - `_acc` will be updated in the next iteration as `_acc = (_acc + _max) % MOD`.

5. **Adjusted States:**
   - `_sum` remains the same.
   - `_max` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to `k`).
   - `i` becomes `n - 2`.
   - `_acc` is updated but we do not need its exact value for the condition check; we just need to know that it will be updated in the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

**State: **`_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`, `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is `n - 2`, `_acc` is updated but we do not have its exact value.**
