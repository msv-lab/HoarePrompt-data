The code updates `_max` to be the maximum value between `_max` and `_sum`. Given the initial state where `_sum` is 0 and `_max` is 0, `_max` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `_sum`, which remains 0 since `_sum` is also 0.

Therefore, `_max` is updated to 0, but `_sum` remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than \(k-1\) and `i` is \(k-1\) is still valid.

Output State: **_sum is 0, _max is 0, n must be greater than \(k-1\), i is \(k-1\)**
