The code initializes `_sum` to 0, which does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, or `a`. The list `a` is populated with integers from the input, but the specific values are not known without further code execution.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `_sum` is 0**
