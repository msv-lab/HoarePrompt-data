Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `_sum` is calculated as `max(0, max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]) + a[3])`
   - `_max` is calculated as `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]))`
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than 1

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet is `_max = max(_max, _sum)`
   - This line updates `_max` to be the maximum value between its current value and `_sum`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `_max` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `_sum`.
   - `_sum` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged (3).
   - `n` remains unchanged (greater than 1).

4. **Calculating Specific Values**:
   - To determine the exact value of `_max`, we need to evaluate `_sum` first.
     - `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]) + a[3])`
       - Let's denote `A = max(0, a[1])`, `B = max(0, A + a[2])`, and `_sum = max(0, B + a[3])`.
       - `_max` is `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, B))`.
     - Given these definitions, `_max` will be the maximum of `max(0, a[1])` and `max(0, B)`.
   - Since `_max` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `_sum`, `_max` will be `_sum` if `_sum` is greater, otherwise it remains `_max`.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - `_max` is now the maximum of its original value and `_sum`.
   - `_sum` remains as `max(0, max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]) + a[3])`.
   - `i` remains 3.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]) + a[3]), _max is the maximum of max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])) and max(0, max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]) + a[3]), i is 3, n is greater than 1**
