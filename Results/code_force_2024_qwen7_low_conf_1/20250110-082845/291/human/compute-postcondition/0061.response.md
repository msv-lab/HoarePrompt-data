Now, let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. Initial State: `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])`, `_max` is `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]))`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1.
2. Code: `_sum = max(0, _sum + a[i])`

Since `i` is 3, the code updates `_sum` as follows:
- The current value of `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])`.
- Adding `a[3]` to `_sum` gives `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]) + a[3]`.
- Taking the maximum of 0 and this sum results in `max(0, max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]) + a[3])`.

Therefore, `_sum` is updated to `max(0, max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]) + a[3])`.

Other variables remain unchanged: `_max` is still `max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]))`, `i` is still 3, and `n` is still greater than 1.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]) + a[3]), _max is max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])), i is 3, n is greater than 1**
