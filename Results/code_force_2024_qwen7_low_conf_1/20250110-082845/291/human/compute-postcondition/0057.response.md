According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_sum` is `max(0, a[1])`, `_max` is `max(0, a[1])`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 1 to allow another iteration.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `_sum` remains as `max(0, a[1])`.
- `_max` remains as `max(0, a[1])`.
- `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`_sum` is max(0, a[1]), `_max` is max(0, a[1]), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
