`res` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `res` is 1, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `res` is 1, and `i` is 1**
