The code `max(_max, _sum)` updates `_max` to be the maximum of its current value and `_sum`. Since `_sum` is defined as `max(0, max(0, a[k]) + a[i])` and `_max` is defined as `max(0, a[k])`, the new value of `_max` will be the larger of these two values.

Given the initial state:
- `_sum` is `max(0, max(0, a[k]) + a[i])`
- `_max` is `max(0, a[k])`
- `n` is greater than `k-1`
- `i` is `k+1`

After executing `_max = max(_max, _sum)`, the new value of `_max` will be the maximum of `_max` and `_sum`.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, max(0, a[k]) + a[i]), _max is max(max(0, a[k]), max(0, max(0, a[k]) + a[i])), n is greater than k-1, i is k+1**
