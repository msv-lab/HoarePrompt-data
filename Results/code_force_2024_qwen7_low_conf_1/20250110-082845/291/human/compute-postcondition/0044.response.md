Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is defined as follows:
   - `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from k-1 to n-1.
   - `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `_acc` is `_max % MOD`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   _acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD
   ```

3. Let's break down the impact of this code:
   - `_acc` is incremented by `(_acc + _max) % MOD`.
   - This means `_acc` takes the value of itself plus the remainder of the sum of `_acc` and `_max` when divided by `MOD`.

4. Since `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution, its value is fixed in the context of the current state.

Therefore, the updated value of `_acc` will be:
\[ \text{_acc} = \text{_acc} + (\text{_acc} + \text{_max}) \% \text{MOD} \]

5. The other variables (`_sum`, `_max`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **_sum is the maximum subarray sum starting from k-1 to n-1, _max is the maximum value of _sum during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to k, i is n - 1, _acc is (_acc + _max) % MOD**
