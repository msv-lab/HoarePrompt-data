The code updates the value of `_acc` by adding `(_acc + _max) % MOD`. Given the initial state, the value of `_acc` is `_max % MOD`, and `_max` is the maximum value between `_sum` and the initial `_max`. The value of `_acc` is updated, but no other variables are affected.

Output State: **_sum is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and adding elements of `a` up to index `n-1`, _max is the maximum value between _sum and the initial _max, `i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `_acc` is ((_max % MOD) + (_max % MOD)) % MOD, `n` must be less than `k`**
