Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` using `range(k)`.
   - The initial value of `i` is `n`, and the loop will run until `i` is less than `k`.

2. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be initialized to a value such that the loop condition (`i < k`) is true initially.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, and the loop runs from `k` to `0`, we need to ensure that `n >= k`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Context**:
   - The loop variable `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop body is omitted, but the context tells us that `_sum` and `_acc` are being updated.
   - `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.

4. **Adjust the Initial States**:
   - `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`.
   - `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.
   - `n` is already given as greater than `k-1`.
   - `i` is set to `n` initially.
   - `_acc` is 0 initially.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` starts from a value that allows the loop to execute. Since the loop will run from `k-1` down to `0`, `i` must be at least `k`.

### Final State:
- `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`.
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.
- `n` is greater than `k-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `_acc` is 0.
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least `k`.

State: **`_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`, `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is `n`, `_acc` is 0**
