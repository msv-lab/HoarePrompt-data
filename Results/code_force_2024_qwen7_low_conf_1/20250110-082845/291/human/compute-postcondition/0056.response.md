The initial state is defined as `_sum` is `max(0, a[1])`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. The code snippet is `_max = max(_max, _sum)`. Since `_max` is not initialized before this line, it defaults to `None` (or can be considered as having no value). However, since `_sum` is defined, `_max` will take the maximum value between `_max` (which is `None`) and `_sum`.

Given `_sum` is `max(0, a[1])`, `_sum` will be `a[1]` if `a[1]` is positive, otherwise it will be 0. Thus, `_max` will be assigned the value of `_sum`, which is `max(0, a[1])`.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, a[1]), _max is max(0, a[1]), i is 1, n must be greater than 1**
