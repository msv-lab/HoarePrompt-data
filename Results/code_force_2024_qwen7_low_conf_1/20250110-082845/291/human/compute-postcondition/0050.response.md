The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the initial state values of `_sum`, `_max`, and `_acc` are no longer relevant for the next state since they were defined before the loop started. The new variables `n` and `k` are introduced.

Since the loop was supposed to run `int(input())` times, and now we know `n` (which is `int(input())` in this context), the loop will run `n` times starting from `i = 1`. The value of `_acc` will be updated to `_acc + _max` from the previous state.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `_acc` is `_acc + _max`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
