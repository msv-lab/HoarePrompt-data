Output State: **_sum is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`, _max is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to k, i is 0, _acc is (_acc + _max) % MOD for all iterations.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`.
   - `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.
   - `n` is greater than `k-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `_acc` is `0`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
   - For each iteration, `_acc` is updated using the formula `_acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD`.

3. **After 1 Iteration**:
   - `_sum` remains the same as the initial `_sum`.
   - `_max` remains the same as the initial `_max`.
   - `n` remains the same as the initial `n`.
   - `i` becomes `n - 1`.
   - `_acc` is updated to `_max % MOD`.

4. **After 2 Iterations**:
   - `_sum` remains the same as the initial `_sum`.
   - `_max` remains the same as the initial `_max`.
   - `n` remains the same as the initial `n`.
   - `i` becomes `n - 2`.
   - `_acc` is updated to `(_acc + _max) % MOD`.

5. **General Case After All Iterations**:
   - Since the loop runs for `k` iterations, `i` will eventually reach `0`.
   - The final value of `_acc` will be the result of applying the update formula `_acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD` `k` times.
   - The final value of `_acc` will be `_max % MOD` for the last iteration, and the updates will propagate through the iterations.

6. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `k > n`, the loop does not execute.
   - `_sum` remains the same as the initial `_sum`.
   - `_max` remains the same as the initial `_max`.
   - `n` remains the same as the initial `n`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `_acc` remains `0`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, the variables will be in the following state:
- `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`.
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `_acc` is `_max % MOD` after all iterations.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **_sum is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`, _max is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution, n is greater than or equal to k, i is 0, _acc is (_acc + _max) % MOD for all iterations.**
