Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Initial State
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of the values of \(n\) and \(k\) for all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `MOD` is 10.

#### Loop Analysis
The loop consists of two nested loops:
1. The outer loop runs for a number of times specified by the user via `input()`.
2. The inner loop processes the list `a` and updates `_sum` and `_max`.
3. After the inner loop, the value of `_acc` is updated based on `_max`.
4. Finally, the result is printed as \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% \text{MOD}\).

#### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Outer Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, `n` and `k` are read from the input.
   - `a` is read and processed.

2. **Inner Loop (First Iteration):**
   - `_sum` is initialized to 0.
   - For each element in `a` up to index `n-1`, `_sum` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`.
   - `_max` is updated to be the maximum of `_max` and `_sum`.

3. **Inner Loop (Subsequent Iterations):**
   - `_acc` is initialized to 0.
   - For each iteration from 0 to `k-1`, `_acc` is updated to \((_acc + _max) \% \text{MOD}\).

4. **Final Output Calculation:**
   - The final result is computed as \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% \text{MOD}\).

### Final State Analysis

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The outer loop runs exactly `t` times.
- For each iteration of the outer loop, the values of `n` and `k` are processed independently.
- The values of `_sum` and `_max` are determined by the processing of the list `a` for each `n`.
- `_acc` accumulates the value of `_max` for each `k`.

Since the outer loop runs `t` times and each time `n` and `k` are read anew, the final values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are determined by the last input values. The list `a` remains unchanged unless new inputs are provided in subsequent loops.

### Output State

**Output State:**  
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `MOD` is 10, `_acc` is the accumulated value of \((_acc + _max) \% \text{MOD}\) over all iterations, `_max` is the maximum cumulative sum of `a` for the last `n` elements, `result` is \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% \text{MOD}\).**

This state reflects the final values of all relevant variables after all iterations of the loop have completed.
