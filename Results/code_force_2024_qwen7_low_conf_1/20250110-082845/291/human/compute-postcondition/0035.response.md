The code assigns the maximum value between `_max` and `_sum` to `_max`. Given the initial state:

- `_sum` is `max(0, a[k])`
- `_max` is 0
- `n` must be greater than \(k-1\)
- `i` is \(k\)

The impact of the code is that `_max` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `_sum`. Since `_max` is initially 0, `_max` will be set to `_sum` because `_sum` is `max(0, a[k])` which is a non-negative value.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **_sum is max(0, a[k]), _max is max(0, a[k]), n must be greater than \(k-1\), i is \(k\)**
