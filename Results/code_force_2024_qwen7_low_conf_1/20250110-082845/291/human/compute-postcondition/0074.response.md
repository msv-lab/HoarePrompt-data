The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly within its definition. Instead, it implies that the function will operate on variables that are defined elsewhere in the code or passed through other means (e.g., global variables or through other function calls). The function processes a list of integers `a` and two positive integers `n` and `k` for each test case, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and for each test case, `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5` with the constraint that the sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed `2 \cdot 10^5`.

The function has two possible return cases:
- Case_1: It returns an error message indicating that the age (or possibly a related variable) cannot be negative.
- Case_2: It returns either a string "minor" or "adult" based on the values of `n` and `k`.

However, since the function does not directly accept `n`, `k`, or `a` as parameters, and the return values depend on internal logic not explicitly shown, we focus on the constraints and expected behavior based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` and two positive integers `n` and `k` for each test case, where the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. It returns an error message if a related variable (possibly derived from `n` and `k`) is negative, and otherwise returns a string indicating whether a condition based on `n` and `k` is met.**
