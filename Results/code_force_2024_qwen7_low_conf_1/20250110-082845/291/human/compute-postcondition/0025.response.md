To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens inside the loop and how the variables change.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `_sum` is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and considering each element of `a` up to index `n-1`.
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` across all iterations of the loop.
- `n` is the number of iterations (which is the same as the length of the list `a` up to the n-th index).
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `t` is the original value read from the standard input.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `MOD` is 10.
- `_acc` is \(((k-1) \cdot _max) \% 10\).
- `i` is \(k-1\).
- The output is the result of \((sum(a) + _acc) \% MOD\).

### For Loop:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable `_` is just an underscore, indicating it's a placeholder and does not affect the actual variables in the state.
2. **Input**: The loop takes an input inside itself, which means the input value is read before each iteration starts.

Since the loop reads an input before starting each iteration, the key thing to note is that the loop will execute once for each input value. The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable, so it doesn't influence the state changes.

### State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- `_sum`: This will be updated based on the new input and the current state of `a`.
- `_max`: This will be the maximum of the new `_sum` and the previous `_max`.
- `n`: This remains the same since `n` is determined by the length of the list `a` and does not change within the loop.
- `k`: This remains the same since `k` is a constant defined outside the loop.
- `t`: This is the value read from the standard input, so it will change with each input.
- `a`: This list may change based on the input value.
- `_acc`: This is calculated based on `_max` and `k`, and it will be recalculated for the next input.
- `i`: This remains \(k-1\) since `i` is derived from `k`.

### New State:
The loop will take another input, so `t` will change. `_sum` and `_max` will be recalculated based on this new input and the current state of `a`.

**State:**
- `_sum` is the new maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and considering each element of `a` up to index `n-1`.
- `_max` is the new maximum value of `_sum` across all iterations of the loop.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `t` is the new value read from the standard input.
- `a` may have changed based on the new input.
- `_acc` is the new value of \(((k-1) \cdot _max) \% 10\).
- `i` remains \(k-1\).

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`_sum` is the new maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and considering each element of `a` up to index `n-1`, `_max` is the new maximum value of `_sum` across all iterations of the loop, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `t` is the new value read from the standard input, `a` may have changed based on the new input, `_acc` is the new value of \(((k-1) \cdot _max) \% 10\), `i` remains \(k-1\)**.
