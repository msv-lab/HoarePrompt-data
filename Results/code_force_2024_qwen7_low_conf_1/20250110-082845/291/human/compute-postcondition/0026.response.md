`n` and `k` are assigned the values of two integers read from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`. The other variables remain unchanged in their previous states.

Output State: **_sum` is the new maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and considering each element of `a` up to index `n-1`, `_max` is the new maximum value of `_sum` across all iterations of the loop, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `t` is the new value read from the standard input, `a` may have changed based on the new input, `_acc` is the new value of \(((k-1) \cdot _max) \% 10\), `i` remains \(k-1\)**
