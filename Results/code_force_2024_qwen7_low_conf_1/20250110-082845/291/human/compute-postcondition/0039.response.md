Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- `_sum` is 0.
- `_max` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `t` is the new value read from the standard input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `_acc` is the new value of \(((k-1) \cdot _max) \% 10\).
- `i` is initially set to \(k-1\).

### Loop Code
```
for i in range(n):
    _sum = max(0, _sum + a[i])
    _max = max(_max, _sum)
```

### Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `_sum` starts at 0.
   - `_max` starts at 0.
   - `i` starts at \(k-1\).

2. **First Iteration (i = 0)**:
   - `_sum` becomes `max(0, 0 + a[0]) = a[0]`.
   - `_max` becomes `max(0, a[0]) = a[0]`.
   - `i` becomes 1.

3. **Second Iteration (i = 1)**:
   - `_sum` becomes `max(0, a[0] + a[1])`.
   - `_max` becomes `max(a[0], max(0, a[0] + a[1]))`.
   - `i` becomes 2.

4. **Third Iteration (i = 2)**:
   - `_sum` becomes `max(0, max(0, a[0] + a[1]) + a[2])`.
   - `_max` becomes `max(a[0], max(max(0, a[0] + a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[0] + a[1]) + a[2])))`.
   - `i` becomes 3.

5. **General Iteration (i = j)**:
   - `_sum` becomes `max(0, max(0, ... + a[j-1]) + a[j])`.
   - `_max` becomes `max(a[0], max(max(0, a[0] + a[1]), ..., max(0, max(0, ... + a[j-1]) + a[j])))`.
   - `i` becomes \(j+1\).

### Final State After All Iterations

- **_sum**: The final value of `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from index \(k-1\) and extending up to index \(n-1\). This is because the loop iteratively updates `_sum` to the maximum of 0 and the current value of `_sum` plus the next element in the list.
- **_max**: The final value of `_max` is the maximum value that `_sum` ever reached during the loop. This is because the loop updates `_max` to the maximum of its current value and `_sum` in each iteration.
- **n**: The value of `n` must be greater than \(k-1\) for the loop to execute.
- **i**: The value of `i` will be \(n\).

### Conclusion

If the loop executes for all \(n\) iterations, the final state of the variables will be:
- `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from index \(k-1\) to \(n-1\).
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.
- `n` must be greater than \(k-1\).
- `i` is \(n\).

If the loop does not execute (i.e., \(n \leq k-1\)), then:
- `_sum` remains 0.
- `_max` remains 0.
- `n` must be less than or equal to \(k-1\).
- `i` is \(k-1\).

### Final Output State

Output State: **_sum is the maximum subarray sum starting from index `k-1` to `n-1`, _max is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution, `n` is greater than `k-1`, `i` is `n`.**
