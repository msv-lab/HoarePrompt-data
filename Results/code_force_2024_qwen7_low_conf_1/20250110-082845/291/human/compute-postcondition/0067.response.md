Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `_sum` is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and adding elements of `a` up to index `n-1`.
   - `_max` is the maximum value between `_sum` and the initial `_max`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `_acc` is `_max % MOD`, where `_acc` is 0 before the operation and becomes `_max % MOD` after the operation.
   - `n` must be less than `k`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(k)`. This means `i` will iterate from 0 to `k-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`, meaning `i` was incremented from `n-1` to `n`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented from `n` to `n+1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `n+1` for the next iteration.
   - The condition `n < k` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n+1`.
   - `n` should remain less than `k`.

Given this analysis, the updated states are:
- `_sum` remains unchanged as it is computed within the loop body.
- `_max` remains unchanged as it is also computed within the loop body.
- `i` is `n+1`.
- `n` remains less than `k`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
State: **`_sum` is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and adding elements of `a` up to index `n-1`, `_max` is the maximum value between `_sum` and the initial `_max`, `i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `_acc` is `_max % MOD`, `n` must be less than `k`**
