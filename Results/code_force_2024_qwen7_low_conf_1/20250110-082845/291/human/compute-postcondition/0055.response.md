The code snippet updates `_sum` based on the value of `a[i]`. However, the variable `_sum` is not defined in the initial state, and there is no definition or initialization of `a[i]` in the given code. Given the current information, we cannot determine the exact value of `_sum` after executing the code, but we know that `_sum` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and its current value plus `a[i]`.

Since `_sum` is not defined initially, the code effectively initializes `_sum` to be the maximum of 0 and `a[1]` (since `i` is 1).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`_sum` is max(0, a[1]), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
