The code updates `_sum` to be the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. Given the initial state, `_sum` and `_max` are both initially set to `max(0, a[k])`, and `i` is set to `k+1`.

The impact of the code is that `_sum` is updated based on the value of `a[i]`. Since `_sum` was initially `max(0, a[k])`, and now it is being updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`, we need to consider the value of `a[i]`.

Given the initial value of `_sum` is `max(0, a[k])`, let's denote this value as `val`. So, `_sum = val`. Now, `_sum` is updated to `max(0, val + a[i])`.

Since `val` is already the maximum of 0 and `a[k]`, adding `a[i]` could potentially increase or decrease its value depending on the value of `a[i]`. However, the minimum value `_sum` can take is 0 because of the `max(0, ...)` function.

Thus, `_sum` will be `max(0, val + a[i])`, which simplifies to `max(0, max(0, a[k]) + a[i])`.

Other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, max(0, a[k]) + a[i]), `_max` is max(0, a[k]), `n` must be greater than `k-1`, `i` is `k+1`**
