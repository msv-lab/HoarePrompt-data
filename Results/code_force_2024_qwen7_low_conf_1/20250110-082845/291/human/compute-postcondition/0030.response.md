Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `_sum` is 0
   - `_max` is 0
   - `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input
   - `t` is the new value read from the standard input
   - `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input
   - `_acc` is the new value of \(((k-1) \cdot _max) \% 10\)
   - `i` remains \(k-1\)

2. **For Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take on values from 0 to \(n-1\).

3. **Determining Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `i` (which starts at \(k-1\)) needs to be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the condition \(i < n\) must be satisfied.

Given these points, let's formulate the required adjustments:

- `i` should be \(k-1\).
- Since the loop runs as long as `i < n`, we need to ensure that \(k-1 < n\).

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` is \(k-1\)
- `n` must be greater than \(k-1\)

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`_sum` is 0, `_max` is 0, `n` must be greater than \(k-1\), `i` is \(k-1\)**
