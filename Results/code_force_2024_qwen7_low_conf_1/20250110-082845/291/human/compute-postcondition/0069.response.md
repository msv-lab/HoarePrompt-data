Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `_sum` is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and adding elements of `a` up to index `n-1`.
   - `_max` is the maximum value between `_sum` and the initial `_max`.
   - `i` is `n+1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `_acc` is `((_max % MOD) + (_max % MOD)) % MOD`.
   - `n` must be less than `k`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n+1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented to `n+2`.

4. **Updating the States:**
   - Since `i` was `n+1` and the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`, we increment `i` to `n+2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change inside the loop.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `_sum` remains the same because the loop body is omitted.
   - `_max` remains the same because the loop body is omitted.
   - `i` is now `n+2`.
   - `n` remains the same (less than `k`).
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `_acc` remains the same because the loop body is omitted.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`_sum` is the maximum cumulative sum starting from 0 and adding elements of `a` up to index `n-1`, `_max` is the maximum value between `_sum` and the initial `_max`, `i` is `n+2`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `_acc` is `((_max % MOD) + (_max % MOD)) % MOD, n` must be less than `k`**
