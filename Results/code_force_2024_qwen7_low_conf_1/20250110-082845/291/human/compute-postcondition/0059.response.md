The code updates `_max` to be the maximum value between its current value and `_sum`. Let's break down the initial state and the impact of the code:

1. `_sum` is calculated as `max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])`.
2. `_max` is initially set to `max(0, a[1])`.
3. `i` is 2.
4. `n` must be greater than 1.

After the code `_max = max(_max, _sum)` is executed, `_max` will take the value of the maximum between its current value and `_sum`.

Given `_sum = max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])`, let's consider different scenarios for `a[1]` and `a[2]`:

- If `a[1] >= 0` and `a[2] >= 0`, then `_sum = a[1] + a[2]`.
- If `a[1] < 0` and `a[2] >= 0`, then `_sum = a[2]`.
- If `a[1] >= 0` and `a[2] < 0`, then `_sum = max(0, a[1]) + a[2]`.
- If `a[1] < 0` and `a[2] < 0`, then `_sum = max(0, a[1])`.

In all cases, `_sum` will be non-negative, and `_max` will be non-negative as well since it starts from `max(0, a[1])`.

Therefore, `_max` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `_sum`. Since `_sum` is derived from the maximum of 0 and the sum of two elements in `a`, and `_max` starts from the maximum of 0 and `a[1]`, `_max` will at least be `max(0, a[1])` and could be larger depending on the values of `a[2]`.

Thus, the updated value of `_max` will be the maximum of `max(0, a[1])` and `_sum`.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2]), _max is max(max(0, a[1]), max(0, max(0, a[1]) + a[2])), i is 2, n must be greater than 1**
