Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial States:**
   - `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`.
   - `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `_acc` is the accumulated value calculated as `_acc + _max` for all iterations.
   - The code prints `(sum(a) + _acc) % MOD`, but we don't need to worry about `a` and `MOD` for this specific task.

2. **Analyze the Loop:**
   - The loop runs for the number of times specified by `int(input())`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the start of the first iteration (`i = 0`), `_sum`, `_max`, and `_acc` are already defined based on the initial conditions.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - Since the loop runs for `int(input())` times, the next state will depend on the value of `int(input())`.

Given the initial state and the structure of the loop, we can determine the next state as follows:

- The value of `i` will be 1.
- The value of `_acc` will be `_acc + _max` from the previous state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from `k-1` to `n-1`, `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` during the loop execution, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is 1, `_acc` is (_acc + _max) % MOD**.
