#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and there is an additional function or input not shown in the provided function definition that handles the actual computation based on the problem description.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    res = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if int(s[i]) < 5:
            res = i
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `res` is the index of the first digit in `s` that is less than 5 or remains -1 if no such digit exists, and `i` is the length of `s` - 1.
    return res
    #`res` which is the index of the first digit in string `s` that is less than 5 or remains -1 if no such digit exists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the index of the first digit in its string representation `s` that is less than 5, or -1 if no such digit exists. The function iterates through each digit of `n`, converting it to a string and checking if it is less than 5. If such a digit is found, the index is stored in `res` and the loop breaks. If no digit is found, `res` remains -1. The function does not rely on any external functions or inputs beyond `n`.
