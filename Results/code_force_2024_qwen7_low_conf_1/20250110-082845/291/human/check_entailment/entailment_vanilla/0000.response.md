Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and trying to find the maximum subarray sum, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the array's sum after performing `k` operations. The program seems to be attempting to remove negative elements from the start or end of the array until the difference between the leftmost and rightmost elements changes, but this approach is flawed and does not lead to the correct solution.

1. **Logic Error**: The logic used in the loop (`while r - l != 0:`) to try and reduce the sum by removing negative elements from the start or end of the array is incorrect. This approach does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the final sum using `mx * (2 ** k - 1)`, where `mx` is incorrectly computed. The intended logic should involve maximizing the initial sum of the array and leveraging the power of `k` operations to further increase the sum.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation `(10 ** 9 + 7)` is applied correctly, but it is only done once at the end of the program. The maximum sum calculation should also consider this modulo.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is completely unrelated to solving the main problem and does not affect the overall correctness of the program.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
