Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the initial sum of the array (`bsum`), and finds a way to maximize the sum using a while loop. However, the logic inside the while loop seems incorrect for the purpose of maximizing the array sum.
   - After the while loop, the program attempts to compute the maximum sum after `k` operations, which seems to be a significant error since the `while` loop does not contribute to the correct solution.
   - The correct approach should involve leveraging the operations to add multiple copies of the sum of the array into the array itself, which is not properly implemented in the current code.
   - The `func_1` function, though irrelevant to the main problem, appears to be a separate function unrelated to the core logic of solving the array modification problem.

3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary describes the `func_1` function, which is not part of the main logic for solving the problem.
   - The main logic of the program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the array sum after `k` operations.

Based on these points, the program provided does not correctly solve the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
