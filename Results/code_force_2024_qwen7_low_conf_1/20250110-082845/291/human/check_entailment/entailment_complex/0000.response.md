Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Sum:**
   - The code attempts to calculate the maximum possible sum using a sliding window approach, but it doesn't correctly handle the problem requirements.
   - The logic inside the while loop seems to be an attempt to optimize the sum of the array by removing elements smaller than or equal to others, which is not relevant to the problem's solution.
   
2. **Problem Solution Explanation:**
   - Given \( n \) integers and \( k \) operations, the optimal strategy is to add the sum of the entire array multiple times since each operation can add the sum of any contiguous subarray anywhere in the array.
   - Therefore, the maximum possible sum can be achieved by adding the original sum of the array \( k \) times, plus the original sum once more (since we can insert the sum of the whole array in the next step).
   - The formula for the maximum sum is \( \text{max\_sum} = (\text{sum of array} \times (2^k - 1)) \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `func_1` function is irrelevant to the main problem and is not used in the provided code.
   - The logic in the main part of the code does not compute the correct maximum sum as per the problem statement. It tries to use a sliding window to maximize the sum, which is not necessary and incorrect for this problem.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
