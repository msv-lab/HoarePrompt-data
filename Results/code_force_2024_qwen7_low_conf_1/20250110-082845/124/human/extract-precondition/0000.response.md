Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^2, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^4. Additionally, a is an array of n integers where a_i = i for all integers i in the range [1, n], and all operations must ensure that after executing the operations, the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 cover all numbers from 1 to n, and a_i ≤ 10^{18} for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**
