The value of `pos` is updated to `i + 2`. Given that `i` is 11, `pos` is now 13. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 11, `i` is 11, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` if `n` is 8, otherwise `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(a_i = i\) for all integers \(i\) in the range \([1, n]\), `data` is unchanged, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans` is `[[8], [3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9], [11, 12, 13]]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing the string representations of `['']`, `pos` is 13, `ost` is `[]`.**
