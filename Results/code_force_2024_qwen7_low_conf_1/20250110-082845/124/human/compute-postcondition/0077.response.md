The code `ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])` appends a list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to the list `ans`. Given the initial values `i = 4`, the elements in the list become `[4, 4 - 4, 4 - 8]`, which simplifies to `[4, 0, -4]`. 

Therefore, the list `ans` will have this new element appended to it. The values of `per`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `i` is 4, `ans` is `[4, 0, -4]`**
