Postcondition: ***`ans` is a non-empty list, `results` is a string containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`, each joined by spaces, followed by the length of `ans` as a new appended string. If `n` is in `ans`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function continues without changing `results`.***
