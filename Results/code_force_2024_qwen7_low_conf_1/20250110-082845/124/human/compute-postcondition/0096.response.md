Postcondition: ***`per` is 5, `n` is 8. If the length of `ost` is 2, then `ans` is `[4, 0, -4, [1, 0, 4]]`, `ost` is `[4, 0]`. If the length of `ost` is 3, then `ans` is `[4, 0, -4, [1, 0, 4]]`, `ost` is `[4, 0]`. If the length of `ost` is 4, then `ans` is `[4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0], [2, 0, 0]]`, `ost` is `[4, 0, 0, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.***
