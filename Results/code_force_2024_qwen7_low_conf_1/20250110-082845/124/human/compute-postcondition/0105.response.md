Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces.** 

### Explanation:
- **Loop Code Analysis**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `ans` and appends the string representation of `x` to the list `results`. This process continues until all elements in `ans` have been processed.
  
- **Initial State**: Initially, `ans` is a non-empty list, and `results` starts as a list with a single element `'4'`.

- **Final State**: After the loop completes, `results` will contain the string representations of all elements in `ans`, concatenated with spaces. Specifically, `results` will be a list where each element is the string representation of an element in `ans`.

- **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute at least once because `ans` is initially a non-empty list. It will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `ans` to process.

Thus, after the loop has finished executing, `results` will contain the string representations of all elements in `ans`, separated by spaces.
