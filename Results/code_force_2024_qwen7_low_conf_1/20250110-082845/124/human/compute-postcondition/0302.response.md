The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. The parameter constraints and relationships are described within the problem statement rather than as part of the function definition. The function must work with predefined variables `t`, `n`, and `a` that satisfy the given constraints.

The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, but based on the constraints, it seems the function might perform some operations to ensure that the GCDs of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 cover all numbers from 1 to n.

Given the constraints, the function likely involves processing the array `a` and possibly performing operations to meet the specified conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but works with predefined variables `t`, `n`, and `a`. It ensures that the GCDs of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 cover all numbers from 1 to n and performs necessary operations to maintain `a_i ≤ 10^{18}` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**
