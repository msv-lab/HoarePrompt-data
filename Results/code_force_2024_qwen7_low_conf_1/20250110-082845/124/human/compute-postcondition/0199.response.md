`results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a string to the `results` list. The string is created by joining the elements of the list `x` into a single string, with each element converted to a string using `map(str, x)`. The `join` method concatenates these strings with a space (' ') as the separator. Since the initial value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact content of the string being appended, but we know it will be a space-separated string of the elements in `x`.

The state of `total` and `i` remains unchanged, and `per` also remains unchanged. The list `ans` is not affected by this line of code. The variable `n` is not affected either. The only change is in the `results` list, which now contains an additional element, a string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 9, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list containing at least two elements, `n` is greater than 16, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x`.**
