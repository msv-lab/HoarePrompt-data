`pos` is assigned the value of `i + 2`. The value of `i + 2` is already known from the initial state as it is `ans[2]`, which is `i + 2`. Therefore, `pos` is assigned the value `i + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than 3, `ans` is a list containing [i, i + 1, i + 2], `pos` is `i + 2`**
