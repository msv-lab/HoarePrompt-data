According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. The loop will execute as long as `ans` contains at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans` must contain at least one element.
- `results` now contains all its previous elements plus a new element which is the string representation of the list `x` joined by spaces.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still contain at least one element. Since `x` is taken from `ans`, the new element added to `results` does not affect the condition for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `ans` must still contain at least one element.
- `results` now contains all its previous elements plus a new element which is the string representation of the list `x` joined by spaces (this state remains unchanged).

State: **`ans` must contain at least one element; `results` now contains all its previous elements plus a new element which is the string representation of the list `x` joined by spaces**
