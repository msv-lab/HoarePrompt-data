Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The code snippet is `results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))`.
2. This line appends a string to the list `results`. The string is created by joining the elements of the list `x` using a space as the separator and converting each element to a string.
3. The variable `x` is not defined within this snippet, so its value remains unchanged. However, this operation does affect `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \).
- `ans` has one less element.
- `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \) and has a length of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not.
- `results[0]` is the new length of `ans`.
- `results[1]` is a space-separated string of integers from the remaining elements in `ans`.

Since the code only modifies `results`, let's focus on the changes:
- `results[0]` will be updated to the current length of `ans`.
- `results[1]` will be updated to a space-separated string of the remaining elements in `ans`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \); `ans` has one less element; `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \) and has a length of 1, 2, 3, or 4; `n` is greater than 3; `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not; `results[0]` is the current length of `ans`; `results[1]` is a space-separated string of the remaining elements in `ans`.**
