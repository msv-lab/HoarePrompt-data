`results` is a list where the new element is appended. The new element is created by joining the elements of the list `x` into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by a space. Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `x`, let's denote the elements of `x` as `x[0], x[1], ..., x[n]`. The new element in `results` will be `'x[0] x[1] ... x[n]'`.

Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty list; `results` is a list with one additional element, which is the string representation of the elements of `x` joined by spaces**
