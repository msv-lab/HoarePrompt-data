The code `results.append(f'{len(ans)}')` appends the length of the list `ans` to the list `results`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `results`, so we only focus on updating the value of `ans`.

- `n` is greater than 16.
- `i` is 8.
- `per` is its initial value (not affected by this code).
- `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12. If `len(ost)` is 1, `ans` now contains the additional element `[1, 2, None]`. If `len(ost)` is 2, then `ans` includes a new list `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]`. If `len(ost)` is 3, the last element of `ans` is `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]`. If `len(ost)` is 4, then `ans` includes the lists `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]` and `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`. Otherwise, the value of `ost` remains unchanged.

Since no value for `ost` is given, we assume it remains unchanged. Therefore, we need to calculate the length of `ans` based on the initial description:

For `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12, the number of elements in `ans` is `(8 - (n // 2 + 12) // (-12)) + 1`. Given that `n > 16`, the smallest possible value for `n // 2 + 12` is `16 // 2 + 12 = 20`. So the range of `i` is from 8 to 20 - 12 = 8, which gives us exactly one element per step. Thus, the number of such elements is `(8 - 8) // (-12) + 1 = 1`.

If `len(ost)` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, the additional elements are added to `ans` accordingly. Since the exact value of `ost` is not provided, we consider the general case where `ost` could be any length, but typically, `ost` would be empty or have up to 4 elements, leading to the additional elements being added.

Therefore, the length of `ans` will be the number of initial elements plus the additional elements based on the length of `ost`. Without the exact value of `ost`, we assume it results in the maximum additional elements being added, i.e., 4 additional elements.

Thus, the length of `ans` is `1 + 4 = 5`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 8, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12 and includes the additional elements `[1, 2, None]`, `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]`, `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]`, `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]`, and `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]` if `len(ost)` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively; otherwise, the length of `ans` is 5.**
