The code appends a string representation of the list `x` (converted to strings and joined by spaces) to the list `results`. Since the initial state does not specify the content of `x`, the output of `' '.join(map(str, x))` will be a string representation of `x` with its elements separated by spaces. The variables `total`, `i`, `per`, `ans`, `n`, and `results` remain unaffected except for `results` which now includes the new appended string.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 10, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list containing at least three elements, `n` is greater than 16, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x`**
