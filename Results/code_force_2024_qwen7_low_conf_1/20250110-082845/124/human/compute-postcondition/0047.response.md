According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `pos` and `n`. The loop starts from `pos + 1` and goes up to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 8
- `pos` is 5
- `n` is 8

The loop condition is `i < n + 1`. Since `i` is already 8 and `n` is 8, the loop will not execute because `i` is equal to `n + 1` (which would be 9), and the loop does not include 9.

Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition is not met.

State: **No changes needed; the loop cannot execute one more time.**
