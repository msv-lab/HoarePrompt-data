The code appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. Since `i` is at least 3 and a multiple of 4, and the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2` is true, the value of `i` is appended to `ost`. The values of `n` and `pos` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ost` with `i` appended.

Output State: **`i` is at least 3 and a multiple of 4; `n` is greater than 3; `pos` must be less than or equal to the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3; `ost` contains `i`.**
