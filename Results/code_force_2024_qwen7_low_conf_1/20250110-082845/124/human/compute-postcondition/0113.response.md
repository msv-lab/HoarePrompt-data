According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. The loop will continue as long as `ans` contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` still needs to contain at least one element.

The key point here is that the loop will iterate over each element in `ans`, so `ans` should still contain at least one element to allow the loop to proceed.

Since the problem does not provide additional details about the content of `ans` or `x`, we only need to ensure that `ans` meets the condition of containing at least one element.

State: **`ans` must contain at least one element**
