Let's analyze the given code and the provided output states step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \).
- `ans` contains valid triplets \([i, i - 4, i - 8]\) plus additional triplets based on the value of `len(ost)`.
- `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \) and has a length of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not.
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is a string representation of the length of `ans`.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for x in ans:
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans` and appends a space-separated string of integers from `x` to `results`.
- Each iteration reduces the length of `ans` by one until `ans` becomes empty.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- Once the loop completes, `ans` will be an empty list because each element is processed and removed from `ans` during each iteration.
- `results` will contain the space-separated strings of all the elements in `ans` in the order they were processed.

### Final Values:
- `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `ost` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `per` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `results` contains the concatenated space-separated strings of all the elements in `ans`.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \); `ans` is an empty list; `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \) and has a length of 1, 2, 3, or 4; `n` is greater than 3; `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not; `results` is a list containing the space-separated strings of all the elements in `ans`.**
