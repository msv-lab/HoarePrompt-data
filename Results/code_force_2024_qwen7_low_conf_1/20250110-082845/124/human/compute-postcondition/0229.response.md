To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop runs in steps of 4, starting from 3 up to but not including `n - 1`.
2. The condition `i > n // 2 - 2` determines the value of `ans` and `pos`.
3. We need to check if the current `i` (which is at least 7) meets the condition `i > n // 2 - 2` to decide the new values of `ans` and `pos`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is at least 7.
   - `n` is greater than 3.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` such that `i = 3, 7, 11, ...` until `i < n - 1`.
   - We need to check if `i > n // 2 - 2`.

3. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - The next value of `i` will be determined by the step size of 4.
   - If `i` was 7, the next value would be `7 + 4 = 11`.
   - If `i` was 11, the next value would be `11 + 4 = 15`, and so on.

4. **Decision Based on Condition:**
   - If the next `i` (e.g., 11) satisfies `i > n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` and `pos` will be updated accordingly.
   - If the next `i` does not satisfy this condition, `ans` and `pos` remain unchanged.

Given the conditions:
- `i` is at least 7.
- `n` is greater than 3.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 4`.
- We need to check if `i + 4 > n // 2 - 2` to decide the new values of `ans` and `pos`.

Since `i` is at least 7, the next possible values for `i` are:
- If `i` is 7, the next value will be 11.
- If `i` is 11, the next value will be 15, and so on.

We need to ensure that the next value of `i` still satisfies the loop condition and the state requirements.

**Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `i` will be `i + 4` (next valid value).
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- The condition `i > n // 2 - 2` needs to be checked for the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is at least 11, `n` is greater than 3. If `i + 4 > n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` is `[i + 4 + 4, i + 4 + 5, i + 4 + 6, i + 4, i + 4 + 1, i + 4 + 2]` and `pos` is `i + 4 + 2`. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `pos` remain unchanged.**
