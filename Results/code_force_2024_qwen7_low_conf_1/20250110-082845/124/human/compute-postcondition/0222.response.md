`ans.append([i, i + 1, i + 2])` appends a list containing `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to the `ans` list. Since `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, and `i` is at least 3, the elements in the list will be `i`, `i + 1`, and `i + 2`. The initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than 3, and ans is a list containing [i, i + 1, i + 2]**
