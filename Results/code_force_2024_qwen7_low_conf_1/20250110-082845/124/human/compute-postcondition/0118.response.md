The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of variables outside of the loop. Given the initial state, the values of `ans` and `results` are unchanged by the `continue` statement. 

Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element; `results` is a string containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`, each joined by spaces, followed by the length of `ans` as a new appended string.**
