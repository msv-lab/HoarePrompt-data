Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the provided code snippet step by step:

- Initial State: `i` is at least 11, `n` is greater than 3. If `i + 4 > n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` is `[i + 4 + 4, i + 4 + 5, i + 4 + 6, i + 4, i + 4 + 1, i + 4 + 2]` and `pos` is `i + 4 + 2`. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `pos` remain unchanged.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans.append([i, i + 1, i + 2])
```

Let's consider the impact of this line of code:

1. The condition `i + 4 > n // 2 - 2` is not checked in this snippet. Whether it is true or false, the `ans` and `pos` values will not be set according to this condition because the snippet only appends to `ans`.
2. The list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` is appended to the existing list `ans`.

Since the condition is not evaluated here, we assume the initial state of `ans` remains unchanged unless it was modified previously. However, given the provided snippet, the only impact is the appending of the new list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is at least 11, `n` is greater than 3, `ans` is `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` appended to the original `ans` list, and `pos` remains unchanged.**
