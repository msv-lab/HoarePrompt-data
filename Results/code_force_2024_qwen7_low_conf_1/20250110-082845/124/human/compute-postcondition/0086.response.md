`ans` is a list that originally contains `[4, 0, -4]`. The code appends a new list `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]` to `ans`. Given that `ost` is a list containing `[4, 0]`, `ost[1]` is `0` and `ost[0]` is `4`. Therefore, the appended list is `[1, 0, 4]`. The other variables (`per`, `n`, `ost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `ans` is `[4, 0, -4, [1, 0, 4]]`, `ost` is `[4, 0]`**
