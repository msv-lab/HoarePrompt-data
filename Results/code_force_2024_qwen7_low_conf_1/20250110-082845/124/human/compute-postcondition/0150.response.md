The code `per = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to `per`. Given the initial conditions, `n` minus 1 is not divisible by 4, and the remainder when `n` minus 1 is divided by 4 is 2. This means `per` is also not divisible by 4 and the remainder when `per` is divided by 4 is 2.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is its original value, `per` is equal to `n - 1`, and the remainder when `per` is divided by 4 is 2.

Output State: **`n` is its original value, `per` is equal to `n - 1`, and the remainder when `per` is divided by 4 is 2**
