Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is 8, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, `data` is unchanged, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing the string representations of `['']`, `per` is either 4 or 5 based on the condition `(n - 2) % 4 == 2`, `pos` is 8, `ost` contains all `i` values from 7 to 8 that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > 8 // 2` and `(n - 1) % 4 != 2`, and if `(n - 3) % 4 == 2` holds true, then `per` is updated to 5.**
