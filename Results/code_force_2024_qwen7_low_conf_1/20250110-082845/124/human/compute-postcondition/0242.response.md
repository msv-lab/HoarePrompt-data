The code `pos.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pos`. The initial state is that `i` is the next multiple of 4 greater than `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than 3, and `pos` is `[i]`.

After the code executes, the value of `i` remains unchanged, and the list `pos` will now contain two elements: the original `i` and the value of `i` appended again.

Output State: **`i` is the next multiple of 4 greater than `n // 2`, `n` is greater than 3, and `pos` is `[i, i]`**
