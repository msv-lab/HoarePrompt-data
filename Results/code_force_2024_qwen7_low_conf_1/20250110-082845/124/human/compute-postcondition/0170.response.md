`ost` is a list that initially contains the value 8. The code `ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 8) to the list `ost`. After appending, the list `ost` will contain the values [8, 8]. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 8, `ost` is [8, 8]**
