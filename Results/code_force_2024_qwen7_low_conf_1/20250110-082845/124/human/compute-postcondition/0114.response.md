The code `results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a new element to the list `results`. The new element is a string created by joining the elements of the list `x` with a space (' ') as the separator, and converting each element in `x` to a string using `map(str, x)`.

In the initial state, `ans` must contain at least one element. However, there is no direct reference to `ans` in the given code snippet. The code snippet modifies the `results` list. Since `ans` is not directly affected by the code, its state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the only variable that changes is `results`, which gets a new element appended to it. The exact value of this new element depends on the contents of `x`, but we cannot specify it without knowing the contents of `x`.

Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element; `results` now contains all its previous elements plus a new element which is the string representation of the list `x` joined by spaces**
