The code snippet provided does not change any variables; it simply writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, each element separated by a newline character. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `index`, `ans`, `results`) are altered by this operation. The output to the console will be the string representations of the elements in `results` joined by newlines, but this does not affect the values of the variables themselves.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0][0]`, `n` is the final value of `n` after `t` iterations, `index` is `t + 1`, `ans` is a list of lists constructed based on the value of `n` and the loop logic, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces**.
