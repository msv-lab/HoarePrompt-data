Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is a multiple of 4 and at least 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `pos` is `[i]`.

2. **Condition for the Loop:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
   - If this condition is true, `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `pos` is `[i]`.
   - If the condition is false, the state of the variables does not change.

3. **For Loop Statement:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `pos + 1` to `n + 1`.

4. **Determine the New Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `pos + 1` and `pos` is `[i]`, the loop starts from `i + 1`.
   - The loop will increment `i` until it finds an `i` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the start of the current iteration, `i` was a multiple of 4 and at least 3.
   - The loop will start from `i + 1`.
   - The loop will continue until it finds an `i` that satisfies the condition.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be such that `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2` is true.

6. **New State After the Loop Execution:**
   - The new value of `i` must satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
   - Since `i` must be a multiple of 4 (from the previous state), the smallest possible value for `i` that could satisfy the condition is the next multiple of 4 greater than `n // 2`.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The new state after the loop execution should be such that `i` is the next multiple of 4 greater than `n // 2` and the loop can continue if this `i` satisfies the condition.

Therefore, the new state should be:
- `i` is the next multiple of 4 greater than `n // 2`.
- `n` must still be greater than 3.
- `pos` is `[i]`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is the next multiple of 4 greater than n // 2, `n` must be greater than 3, and `pos` is `[i]`**.
