The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` by assigning it the integer value of `data[index]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `i` is `n // 2 + 12`
- `per` retains its initial value
- `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from `n // 2 + 12` down to `n // 2 + 12`
- `n` is now `int(data[index])` (since it is updated by the code)
- `results` is a list of string representations of all elements in `ans`
- `t` is `t - 1`

Output State: **`i` is `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12` down to `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is a list of string representations of all elements in `ans`, `t` is `t - 1`**
