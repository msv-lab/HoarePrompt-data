`ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12. The last operation appends `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]` to `ans`. Since `ost` is a list with a length of 3, `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]` is `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]`. The initial state of `n` being greater than 16, `i` being 8, `per` being its initial value, and the length of `ost` being 3 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 8, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12, and the last element of `ans` is `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]`, `ost` is a list with a length of 3**
