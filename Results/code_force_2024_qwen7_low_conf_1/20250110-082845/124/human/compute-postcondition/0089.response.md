`ans` is a list containing `[4, 0, -4]`. The code appends a new list `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]` to `ans`. Since `ost` is `[4, 0, 0]`, the new list appended to `ans` is `[4, 0, 0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated `ans` is now `[[4, 0, -4], [4, 0, 0]]`.

Output State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `ans` is [[4, 0, -4], [4, 0, 0]], `ost` is [4, 0, 0]**
