The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using `input().split()`. This means that the string read from the input is split into multiple substrings based on whitespace. Since the initial state of `t` and `n` is not directly affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. However, the input is now stored in the `data` variable as a list of strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^2, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^4, `a` is an array of n integers where a_i = i for all integers i in the range [1, n], and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
