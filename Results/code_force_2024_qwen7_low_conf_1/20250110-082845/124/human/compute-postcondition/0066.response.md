The code appends a list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to the `ans` list. However, since `ans` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is being created or updated here. The value of `i` is an integer greater than 8, so `i - 4` will be greater than 4 and `i - 8` will be greater than 0.

- `i` remains an integer greater than 8.
- `i - 4` is an integer greater than 4.
- `i - 8` is an integer greater than 0.

The output state is: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `i` is an integer greater than 8; `ans` contains `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` where `i` is an integer greater than 8, `i - 4` is an integer greater than 4, and `i - 8` is an integer greater than 0.**
