`ost` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2` and less than or equal to 8, and `n` is greater than 3, the value of `i` can be one of the integers from the range determined by `n // 2 + 1` to 8 (inclusive). However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, so we can only state that `i` is appended to the list `ost`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2` and less than or equal to 8, `ost` contains the value of `i`.**
