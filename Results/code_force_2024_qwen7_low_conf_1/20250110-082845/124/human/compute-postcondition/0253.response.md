The code `per = n - 3` assigns the value of `n - 3` to the variable `per`. The initial state of `per` is `n`, and now it is updated to `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and `i > n // 2`; `n` is greater than 3; `pos` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`; `per` is `n - 3`; `ost` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the condition; the current value of `(n - 3) % 4` is equal to 2**
