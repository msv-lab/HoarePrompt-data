`ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])` appends a list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to the `ans` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 8. So, the list appended to `ans` will be `[8, 4, 0]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `per`, `ost`, and `ans` are updated accordingly.

- `n` remains greater than 16.
- `i` is now 8.
- `per` remains less than or equal to 8.
- `ost` remains as specified (its value is unchanged).
- `ans` now includes the list `[8, 4, 0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 8, `per` is less than or equal to 8, `ost` remains as specified, and `ans` includes the list [8, 4, 0]**.
