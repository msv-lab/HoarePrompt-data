Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n // 2 + 12`, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from `n // 2 + 12` down to `n // 2 + 12` (i.e., only one element), `n` is greater than 16, `results` is a list of string representations of all elements in `ans`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans`.
- Each element `x` is a list of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` where `i` ranges from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12.
- Since `n` is greater than 16, the smallest possible value for `i` is `n // 2 + 12`.
- The loop will continue until there are no more elements in `ans` to process.
- After the loop completes, `results` will contain the string representations of all elements in `ans`.

Since the loop processes each element in `ans` and appends its string representation to `results`, and `ans` will be exhausted when `i` reaches `n // 2 + 12`, the final state of the loop is as described above.
