The code initializes an empty list `ost`. This does not affect any of the other variables. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, `t` is `t - 1` minus the number of elements in `ans`, `index` is `index + 1` plus the number of elements in `ans`, `pos` is 0, `ost` is an empty list.**
