`index` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `index` changes from its previous value. However, the values of `ans` and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, and `index` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, and `index` is increased by 1.**
