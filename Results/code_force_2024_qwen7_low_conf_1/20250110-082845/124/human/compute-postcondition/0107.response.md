`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `index` is not specified, so it could be any valid index that exists in the `data` list. The value of `ans` and `results` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
