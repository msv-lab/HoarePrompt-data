Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is 8, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, `data` is unchanged, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing the string representations of `['']`, `per` is 8, `pos` is 8, `ost` is a list containing the values 7 and 8 since they satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`**
