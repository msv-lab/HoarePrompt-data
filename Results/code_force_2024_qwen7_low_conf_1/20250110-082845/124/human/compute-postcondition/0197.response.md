The code snippet appends a string representation of the list `x` to the list `results`. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. Since the exact content of `x` is not given, we cannot determine the exact appended string. But we know that `x` is a list (since `ans` is a list and the operation is being performed on `x`). 

The variables `total`, `i`, `per`, and `ans` remain unchanged because the code does not affect them directly. The only variable affected is `results`, which now contains an additional element, a string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 8, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is greater than 16, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x`.**
