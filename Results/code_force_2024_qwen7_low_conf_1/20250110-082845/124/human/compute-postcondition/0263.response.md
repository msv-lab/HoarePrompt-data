Postcondition: ***`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies the condition `i > n // 2`. `ans` contains either `[12, 8, 4]` if `i` is 12, or includes the current value of `i` which is less than or equal to 8. `n` must be greater than 3. `per` must be a value less than or equal to `n // 2` but greater than `n // 2 - 12`. `ost` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the condition, now including the current value of `i`.***
