According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop `for i in range(3, n - 1, 4)` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 3 (since the range function stops at `n-1`).

At the start of the loop, we have:
- `ans` is an empty list (`[]`).
- `results` is `"[] 0"`.
- `pos` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 3. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`ans` is an empty list (`[]`), `results` is `"[] 0"`, `pos` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3**
