Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Given Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(pos + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial State:
- `total` is not relevant to this loop.
- `students_list` is not relevant to this loop.
- We need to focus on `pos` and `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `pos + 1` to `n` inclusive.
   - This means the loop will only execute if there are values in the range `pos + 1` to `n`.

2. **Variables Involved:**
   - `i`: This variable will take on values starting from `pos + 1` up to `n`.
   - `pos`: This is the initial value of `i` before the loop starts.
   - `n`: This is the upper limit of the range for the loop.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- For the loop to execute, there must be at least one value in the range `pos + 1` to `n`.
- Specifically, `pos + 1` should be less than or equal to `n`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will execute if `pos + 1 <= n`.
- If the loop executes, `i` will iterate through each value from `pos + 1` to `n`.

### Conclusion:
**Output State:**
```plaintext
pos must be less than n, and n must be a positive integer.
```

This ensures that the loop can execute based on the given conditions.
