Postcondition: ***`i` is a multiple of 4 and at least 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `pos` is `[i]`. If the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2` is true, then `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `pos` is `[i]`. If the condition is false, then the state of the variables does not change.***
