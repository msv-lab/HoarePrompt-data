The code snippet `ans.append([1, ost[1], ost[0]])` appends a list `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]` to the list `ans`. Since `ost` is a list containing values of `i` that were added when `i <= 8`, and currently `len(ost)` equals 2, `ost[0]` and `ost[1]` are the last two elements in `ost`. The values of `ost[0]` and `ost[1]` are not specified, but they are part of the list `ost` which contains at least two elements.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. The output state will include the updated list `ans` with the new triplet appended, and all other variables will retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \); `ans` contains all the valid triplets \([i, i - 4, i - 8]\) plus the new triplet \([1, ost[1], ost[0]]\); `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \); currently, `len(ost)` equals 2; `n` is greater than 3; `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not; `len(ost)` is not equal to 1**
