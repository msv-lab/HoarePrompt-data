According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `ans`. The loop can execute again if there are more elements left in `ans`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans` is a non-empty list.
- `results` is a list with one additional element, which is the string representation of the elements of `x` joined by spaces.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The list `ans` must have at least one more element after the current element has been processed.
- Since `results` already contains the string representation of one element, `results` will contain the string representation of two elements after the next iteration.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `ans` should have at least one more element.
- `results` will have one more element, which is the string representation of two elements of `x` joined by spaces.

State: **`ans` is a non-empty list with at least one more element, `results` is a list with two elements**
