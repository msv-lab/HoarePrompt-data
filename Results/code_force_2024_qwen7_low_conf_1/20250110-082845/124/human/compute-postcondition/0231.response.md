`pos` is assigned the value `i + 2`. Since `i` is at least 11, `pos` will be at least 13. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is at least 11, `n` is greater than 3, `ans` is `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` appended to the original `ans` list, and `pos` is `i + 2`.

Output State: **`i` is at least 11, `n` is greater than 3, `ans` is `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` appended to the original `ans` list, and `pos` is `i + 2`**
