The code `pos.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pos`. Since `i` is a multiple of 4 and at least 3, and `pos` is the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and at least `i`, the value of `pos` will be updated to include `i`. However, the initial value of `pos` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but it must satisfy the condition of being the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and at least `i`.

Since `i` is a multiple of 4 and at least 3, let's consider the smallest possible value for `i`, which is 4 (as 4 is the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3). If `i` is 4, then `pos` must also be 4 because it must be the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and at least `i`.

After appending `i` to `pos`, the new value of `pos` will be `[4]` if `i` is 4, or `[i]` if `i` is a different multiple of 4.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is a multiple of 4 and at least 3; `n` must be greater than 3; `pos` is `[i]`**
