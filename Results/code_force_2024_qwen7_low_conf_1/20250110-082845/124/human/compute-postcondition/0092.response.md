`ans` is a list containing `[4, 0, -4]`. The code appends a new list `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]` to `ans`. Given that `ost` is `[4, 0, 0, 0]`, `ost[0]` is `4` and `ost[1]` is `0`. Therefore, the new list appended to `ans` is `[1, 4, 0]`.

The other variables (`per`, `n`, `ost`) remain unchanged. So, the updated state of the variables is:

- `per` is `5`
- `n` is `8`
- `ans` is now `[4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0]]`

Output State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `ans` is [4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0]], `ost` is [4, 0, 0, 0]**
