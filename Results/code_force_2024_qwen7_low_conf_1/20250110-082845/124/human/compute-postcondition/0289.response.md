Postcondition: ***`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \); `ans` contains all the valid triplets \([i, i - 4, i - 8]\) generated during the loop, plus either \([ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]\) if `len(ost) == 3`, or \([1, ost[0], ost[1], 2, ost[2], ost[3]]\) if `len(ost) == 4`; `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \); `n` is greater than 3; `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not; `len(ost)` is either 3 or 4.***
