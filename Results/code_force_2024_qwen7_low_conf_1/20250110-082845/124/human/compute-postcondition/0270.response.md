To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given conditions and the constraints of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( i \) is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \).
   - If \( i > 8 \), then \( ans \) contains \([i, i - 4, i - 8]\).
   - If \( i \) is 16, then \( ans \) is \([12, 8, 4]\).
   - \( per \) must be a value less than or equal to \( n // 2 \) but greater than \( n // 2 - 12 \).
   - \( ost \) includes the new value of \( i \).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over values of \( i \) from \( per \) to \( n // 2 \) in steps of -12.

3. **Determine the New Value of \( i \):**
   - Since the loop decreases \( i \) by 12 each iteration, the new value of \( i \) will be \( i - 12 \).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - **\( i \):** The new value of \( i \) will be \( i - 12 \).
   - **\( per \):** The new value of \( per \) should still satisfy \( per \leq n // 2 \) and \( per > n // 2 - 12 \). However, since \( i \) is decreasing, \( per \) might change depending on the current value of \( i \).
   - **\( ans \):** The value of \( ans \) will only be updated if the new \( i \) matches specific criteria (i.e., \( i > 8 \) or \( i = 16 \)).
   - **\( ost \):** The new value of \( ost \) will include the new value of \( i \).

5. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will continue as long as \( i - 12 \geq n // 2 \).

Given these considerations, let's assume the current value of \( i \) is such that it needs to decrease by 12 to continue the loop. We need to ensure \( per \) still fits within its bounds.

### Example Calculation:

If \( i \) is currently 16 (since \( i \) is a multiple of 4 and satisfies the conditions), then:
- \( i - 12 = 4 \)
- \( per \) must be a value such that \( per \leq n // 2 \) and \( per > n // 2 - 12 \).

Assuming \( n = 20 \):
- \( n // 2 = 10 \)
- \( n // 2 - 12 = -2 \)

So, \( per \) must be between -2 and 10, but since \( per \) must be positive, \( per \) could be 10 (as it is the highest valid value).

### Final State:

State: **`i` is 4, `per` is 10, `ans` remains unchanged if not updated, `ost` includes the new value of `i` (4)**.

This ensures the loop can continue with the new value of \( i \) and the correct bounds for \( per \).
