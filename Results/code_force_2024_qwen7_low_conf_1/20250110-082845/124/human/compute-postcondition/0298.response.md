The code appends the first element of `ans` to `results` in the form of a space-separated string. Given the initial state:

- `ans` has one less element.
- `x` is the first element of the updated `ans`.
- `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \) and has a length of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not.
- `results[0]` is the length of `ans` minus one.
- `results[1]` is the first element of `ans` in a space-separated string format.

After the code execution:
- `results` will have an additional element, which is a string representation of the first element of `ans`.

Therefore, the updated `results` will be:
- `results[0]` remains the length of `ans` minus one.
- `results[1]` remains the first element of `ans` in a space-separated string format.
- `results` now includes an additional element, which is `' ' + str(x)` (the first element of `ans` as a string).

The output state is:
Output State: **`ans` has one less element; `x` is the first element of the updated `ans`; `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \) and has a length of 1, 2, 3, or 4; `n` is greater than 3; `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not; `results[0]` is the length of `ans` minus one; `results[1]` is the first element of `ans` in a space-separated string format; `results` includes an additional element, which is `' ' + str(x)`**.
