Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2`.
   - If `i` is greater than 8, `ans` is a list containing `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`.
   - If `i` is less than or equal to 8, `ost` contains the value of `i`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(per, n // 2, -12)`. This means `i` decreases by 12 each time.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Analyzing the Loop:**
   - Since `i` decreases by 12 each time, the loop will continue as long as `i` is within the specified range (i.e., `per` to `n // 2`).

5. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2`.
   - The exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not given, but we know it was greater than `n // 2` and decreased by 12 from its initial value.

6. **Determining the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Let's assume the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is \( i_{prev} \).
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be \( i_{prev} - 12 \).

7. **Ensuring the Loop Continues:**
   - For the loop to continue, \( i_{prev} - 12 \) must still be within the range `per` to `n // 2`.
   - Additionally, the condition for `ans` and `ost` must be considered.

Given the above analysis, let's state the conditions at the start of the next iteration:

- `n` must still be greater than 3.
- `i` must now be an integer greater than `n // 2` but decreased by 12, i.e., \( i > n // 2 \) and \( i = i_{prev} - 12 \).
- Depending on the new value of `i`, either `ans` or `ost` should be updated accordingly.

Since the exact previous value of `i` is not specified, we generalize the conditions based on the decrease:

**State:**
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` must be an integer greater than `n // 2` but decreased by 12 from its previous value.
- If `i` is greater than 8, `ans` is a list containing `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`.
- If `i` is less than or equal to 8, `ost` contains the value of `i`.

However, since we need a specific state for the next iteration, we can provide a more concrete example if needed. Assuming the previous value of `i` was 10 (as an example), then:

**State:**
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` must be 10 - 12 = 8.
- `i` is now 8, so `ost` contains the value of 8.

Thus, the final state would be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 8, `ost` contains the value of 8.**
