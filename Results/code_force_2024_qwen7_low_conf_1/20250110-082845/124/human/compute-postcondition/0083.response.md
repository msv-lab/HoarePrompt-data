The code appends the list `[1, 2, ost[0]]` to the list `ans`. Given that `ost[0]` is 4 (since `ost` is `[4]`), the appended list is `[1, 2, 4]`.

After the operation, `ans` will have the updated list. The original lists within `ans` are not modified; only a new list is added.

Output State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `ans` is [[4, 0, -4], [1, 2, 4]], `ost` is [4]**
