Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` is either 8 or unchanged, `a` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] if `n` is 8, otherwise `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(a_i = i\) for all integers \(i\) in the range \([1, n]\), `data` is unchanged, `ans1` is [8], `ans2` is [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]], `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`, `ans` contains all elements that were originally in `ans` and no additional elements.***
