`ans` is a list that gets appended with a sublist containing `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 8, so `i - 4` is 4 and `i - 8` is 0. Therefore, `ans` is updated to include the sublist `[8, 4, 0]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and `ost` is still 8.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 8, `ost` is 8, `ans` is [[8, 4, 0]]**
