According to the given for loop statement and the provided states, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop variable used in the for loop is `_` (a placeholder indicating an iteration counter), and the loop iterates `t` times.

2. **Current State at End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `i` is `n // 2 + 12`.
   - `per` is its initial value.
   - `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from `n // 2 + 12` down to `n // 2 + 12` (i.e., only one element).
   - `n` is greater than 16.
   - `results` is a list of string representations of all elements in `ans`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are remaining iterations to execute, i.e., `t > 0`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `t` times and we need to adjust the state for the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`total`, `i`, `per`, `ans`, and `results`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are specified within it.

5. **Final State for Next Iteration**:
   - `total` remains unspecified.
   - `i` remains `n // 2 + 12`.
   - `per` remains its initial value.
   - `ans` remains a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from `n // 2 + 12` down to `n // 2 + 12`.
   - `n` remains greater than 16.
   - `results` remains a list of string representations of all elements in `ans`.
   - `t` is now `t - 1`.

State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n // 2 + 12`, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from `n // 2 + 12` down to `n // 2 + 12`, `n` is greater than 16, `results` is a list of string representations of all elements in `ans`, `t` is `t - 1`**
