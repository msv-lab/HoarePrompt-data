The code updates the value of `pos` to `i + 2`. However, the value of `i` in the initial state is not explicitly given. Since `ans` is defined as `[i_prev + 4, i_prev + 5, i_prev + 6]`, we know that `i_prev` is a part of the initial state. But since `i` itself is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `pos`. Nevertheless, the code does not affect the values of `ans`, `results`, or `n`.

Output State: **`ans` is `[i_prev + 4, i_prev + 5, i_prev + 6]`, `results` is `"[] 0"`, `pos` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than 3**
