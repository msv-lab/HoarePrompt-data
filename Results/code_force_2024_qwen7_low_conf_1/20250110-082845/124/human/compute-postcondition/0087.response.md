Postcondition: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `ans` is `[4, 0, -4]`, `ost` is `[4, 0]`, all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.** 

This postcondition includes all the variables from the precondition and specifies that `ost` has an additional element `0`, thereby ensuring that the length of `ost` is not 2, thus negating the if condition.
