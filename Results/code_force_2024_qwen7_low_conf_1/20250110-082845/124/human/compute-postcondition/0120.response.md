The given code initializes `ans` as an empty list. The previous state of `ans` was a non-empty list, which is no longer the case since it is now empty. However, the description also mentions that `results` is a string containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`, each joined by spaces, followed by the length of `ans` as a new appended string. Since `ans` is now an empty list, `results` would be an empty string.

The code does not contain any logic that checks if `n` is in `ans` or performs any operations on `results`. Therefore, the state of `results` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is determined by the initial condition provided.

Output State: **`ans` is an empty list, `results` is a string containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` (which is an empty list), each joined by spaces, followed by the length of `ans` as a new appended string (which is "0").**
