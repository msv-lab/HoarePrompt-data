The value of `pos` is updated to `i + 2`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `pos`. We only know that `pos` is now `i + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans` is `[[0, 1, 2]]`, `results` is `"[] 0"`, `pos` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than 3**
