`ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])` appends a list containing the values of `i`, `i - 4`, and `i - 8` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2` and currently greater than 8, let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`. Given the condition that `i_current > 8`, we can express the elements in the list as `[i_current, i_current - 4, i_current - 8]`.

The values of `n` and `i` themselves do not change. So, the output state is: `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2` (with its current value being `i_current`), and `ans` now contains the list `[i_current, i_current - 4, i_current - 8]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2` (current value `i_current`), `ans` is a list containing `[i_current, i_current - 4, i_current - 8]`**.
