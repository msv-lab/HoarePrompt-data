`ans` is appended with a new list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume `i` to be 0 (as it's the first iteration of appending to an empty list). Therefore, the new list added to `ans` is `[0, 1, 2]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans` is `[[0, 1, 2]]`, `results` is `"[] 0"`, `pos` is 0, `n` is greater than 3**
