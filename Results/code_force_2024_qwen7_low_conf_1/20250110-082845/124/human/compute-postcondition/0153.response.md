`per` is assigned the value of `n - 2`. Given the initial condition `((n - 2) % 4 == 2)`, it means `n - 2` leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. This implies that `per` also leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, i.e., `per % 4 == 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is its original value, `per` is `n - 2`, and `per % 4 == 2`**
