Postcondition: ***`per` is 5, `n` is 8. If the length of `ost` is 3, then `ans` is [[4, 0, -4], [4, 0, 0]], `ost` is [4, 0, 0]. Otherwise, if the length of `ost` is 4, `ans` is [4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0], [2, 0, 0]], `ost` is [4, 0, 0, 0], and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.***
