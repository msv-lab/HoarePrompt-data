Postcondition: ***`per` is 5, `n` is 8, and `ans` and `ost` are updated based on the length of `ost`:
- If `len(ost) == 1`, `ans` remains `[4, 0, -4]` and `ost` remains `[4]`.
- If `len(ost) == 2`, `ans` becomes `[4, 0, -4, [1, 2, 4]]` and `ost` becomes `[4, 0]`.
- If `len(ost) == 3` or `len(ost) == 4`, `ans` becomes `[4, 0, -4, [1, 0, 4]]` (for `len(ost) == 3`) or `[4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0], [2, 0, 0]]` (for `len(ost) == 4`), and `ost` becomes `[4, 0, 0, 0]`.
All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.***
