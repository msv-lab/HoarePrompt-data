Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `per` is 5.
- `n` is 8.
- If `i` is an integer greater than 8, `ans` contains `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` where `i` is an integer greater than 8, `i - 4` is an integer greater than 4, and `i - 8` is an integer greater than 0.
- Otherwise, `i` is an integer greater than 4, and `ans` contains the value 5, 6, or 7.

### Loop Definition
```
for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
The loop starts with `i = per` (which is 5) and decrements by 12 each iteration until `i` is no longer within the specified range. The range here is from `per` (5) to `n // 2` (8 // 2 = 4).

### Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration
- Since `per` is 5 and `n` is 8, the loop will stop when `i` reaches or goes below 4.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was such that it caused the condition to be met for `ans` containing values based on `i`.

### Determining the Next Value of `i`
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be just above 4 (since the loop increments by -12).
- Therefore, the next value of `i` would be `i + 12` which should be just above 4 but still within the valid range defined by `per` and `n // 2`.

### Adjusted States
- Since the loop decrements by 12, the next value of `i` will be `i + 12`.
- Given the constraints, the next valid value for `i` should be just above 4, which means the next `i` would be 4 + 12 = 16.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `per` remains 5.
- `n` remains 8.
- `i` will now be 16.
- The condition for `ans` will be checked again based on the new value of `i`.

### Final Answer
State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `i` is 16**
