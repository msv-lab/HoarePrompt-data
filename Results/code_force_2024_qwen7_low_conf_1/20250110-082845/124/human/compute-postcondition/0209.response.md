`results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a string representation of the list `x` to the list `results`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `x`, let's assume `x` is a list. The value of `results` is updated by adding the joined string of `x` to it. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`, `per` is its initial value, `ans` must contain at least one element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representation of `x` joined by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`, `index` is increased by 1**
