`per` is assigned the value of `n - 3`. The condition that the current value of `n` minus 3 is not divisible by 4 with a remainder of 2 remains unchanged because only `per` is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is its original value; `per` is equal to `n - 3`; the current value of `n` minus 3 is not divisible by 4 with a remainder of 2.

Output State: **`n` is its original value; `per` is equal to `n - 3`; the current value of `n` minus 3 is not divisible by 4 with a remainder of 2**
