The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This means that the value of `ans` changes from whatever it was initially (a list containing elements) to an empty list. The other variables (`i`, `per`, `n`, `results`, `t`, `index`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, `t` is `t - 1` minus the number of elements in `ans`, and `index` is `index + 1` plus the number of elements in `ans`.**
