Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 8. If `ost` is `[8, 8]`, then `ans` is `[[8, 8]]`. If `ost` is `[8]`, then `ans` is `[[8, 4, 0]]`.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly combines the conditions from the if part. The precondition remains the same, and the if condition determines the possible states of `ost` and `ans`.
