Let's analyze the given loop and its conditions step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- \( t \) is a positive integer.
- \( n = 8 \).
- \( a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] \).
- \( data \) is unchanged.
- \( ans1 = [8] \).
- \( ans2 = [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]] \).
- \( index = 2 \).
- \( results \) is a list containing the string representations of `['']`.
- \( pos = 8 \).
- \( ost \) contains all \( i \) values from 7 to 8 that satisfy the condition \((i \% 2 != 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > 8 // 2\).
- If \((n - 1) \% 4 == 2\), then \( per = 7 \). Otherwise, \( per = 5 \).

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):
    if i > n // 2:
        if i > 8:
            ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])
        else:
            ost.append(i)
```

### Observations from Given Output States:
1. After 1 iteration:
   - `per` remains 5.
   - `n` remains 8.
   - If `i` is greater than 8, `ans` contains `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is greater than 4, and `ans` contains 5, 6, or 7.

2. After 2 iterations:
   - `per` remains 5.
   - `n` remains 8.
   - `i` becomes 16.
   - If `i` is greater than 8, `ans` contains [[16, 12, 8]].
   - Otherwise, `i` remains 16 and `ost` is [16].

3. After 3 iterations:
   - `per`, `n`, and `i` remain as 5, 8, and 4 respectively.
   - If `i` is greater than 4, the function does not change `ans` and `ost`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is set to `[4, 0, -4]` and `ost` is set to `[4]`.

### Analysis:
- The loop starts with `per` set to 5 and iterates in steps of -12.
- Since \( n = 8 \), \( n // 2 = 4 \).
- The loop will only execute when `i` is greater than 4, meaning `i` can only take values 16, 8, and 4.

### Final State Determination:
- After the loop has executed, the only possible value for `i` is 4 because any larger value would have been processed in the previous iterations.
- When `i = 4`, the loop condition `i > 4` fails, so the loop stops.
- Therefore, `ans` is set to `[4, 0, -4]` and `ost` is set to `[4]`.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop does not execute again after setting `ans` and `ost`, the final state of the variables is:

**Output State:**
- `per` is 5.
- `n` is 8.
- `ans` is `[4, 0, -4]`.
- `ost` is `[4]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `ans` is `[4, 0, -4]`, `ost` is `[4]`.**
