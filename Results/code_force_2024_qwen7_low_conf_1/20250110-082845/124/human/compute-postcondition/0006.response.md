The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The initial value of `index` is 0, so after executing this line of code, `index` will be 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0][0]`, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 30000, `a` is an array of n integers where a_i = i for all integers i in the range [1, n], and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]], `index` is 1**
