`ost` is appended with the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 8, `ost` now contains the value 7 and 8. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is 8, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, `data` is unchanged, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing the string representations of `['']`, `ans` contains all sublists `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` for each valid `i` starting from 3 with a step of 4 until `i` no longer satisfies `i > n // 2 - 2`, `pos` is 5, `ost` is `[7, 8]`, and `i` is 8.
