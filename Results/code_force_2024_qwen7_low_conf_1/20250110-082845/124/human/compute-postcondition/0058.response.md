Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is 8, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, `data` is unchanged, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing the string representations of `['']`, `per` is 8, `pos` is 8, `ost` contains all `i` values from 7 to 8 that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 == 0 and i <= 8 // 2) or (n - 1) % 4 == 2`, and the value of `n` is such that `(n - 3) % 4 == 2`**
