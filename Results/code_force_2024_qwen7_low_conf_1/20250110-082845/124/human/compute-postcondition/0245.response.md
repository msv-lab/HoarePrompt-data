The variable `per` is assigned the value of `n`. The initial conditions of `i`, `n`, `pos`, and `ost` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and `i > n // 2`, `n` is greater than 3, `pos` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `per` is `n`, and `ost` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the condition.**
