Postcondition: ***`i` is `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`, `per` is its initial value, `ans` contains all the elements it had before the loop started, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, `t` is `t - 1` minus the number of elements in `ans`, and `index` is `index + 1` plus the number of elements in `ans`.***
