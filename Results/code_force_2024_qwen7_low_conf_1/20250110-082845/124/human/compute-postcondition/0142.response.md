`ost` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the last value in the range `pos + 1` to `n` that did not satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. The state of `pos`, `n`, and the condition for the loop to execute one more time remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pos` must be less than `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is now stored in `ost`, and for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` must be within the range and must satisfy the condition.

Output State: **`pos` must be less than `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is now stored in `ost`, and for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` must be within the range and must satisfy the condition.**
