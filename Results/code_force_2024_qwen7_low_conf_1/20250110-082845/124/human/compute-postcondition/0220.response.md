To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop itself.

Given:
- `i` is calculated as `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`.
- `per` is its initial value.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `n` is `int(data[index])`.
- `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces.
- `t` is `t - 1` minus the number of elements in `ans`.
- `index` is `index + 1` plus the number of elements in `ans`.
- `pos` is 0.
- `ost` is an empty list.

The for loop:
```python
for i in range(3, n - 1, 4):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Condition**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 3` and increments by `4` until `i < n - 1`.
   - For the loop to start, the condition `3 <= i < n - 1` must hold true initially or after the first few iterations.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is set to `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`.
   - Since `i` is initialized based on `data[index]`, and `n` is also derived from `data[index]`, we need to ensure these values are consistent and valid for the loop to start.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `3 <= i < n - 1`.

### Required Adjustments:

- **Initial Value of `i`**: 
  - `i` must be at least 3 for the loop to start.
  - Therefore, `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12` must be at least 3.
  - Mathematically, this means: 
    \[
    \text{int(data[index])} // 2 + 12 \geq 3
    \]
    Simplifying this, we get:
    \[
    \text{int(data[index])} \geq -18
    \]
    Since `int(data[index])` is a positive integer (as it's an index into a data structure), this condition is always satisfied.

- **Value of `n`**:
  - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to start since the loop runs until `i < n - 1`.
  - Therefore, `int(data[index]) > 3`.

### Final State Adjustment:

Given the above analysis, the required states for the loop to execute are:

- `i` must be at least 3, which is derived from `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

Since the other variables (`per`, `ans`, `results`, `t`, `index`, `pos`, `ost`) do not directly affect the loop's starting condition, they do not need to be adjusted explicitly.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` must be at least 3 (derived from `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`), `n` must be greater than 3**.
