Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \).
- `ans` contains all the valid triplets \([i, i - 4, i - 8]\) plus additional triplets based on the value of `len(ost)`:
  - If `len(ost) == 1`, add \([1, 2, ost[0]]\)
  - If `len(ost) == 2`, add \([1, ost[1], ost[0]]\)
  - If `len(ost) == 3`, add \([ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]\)
  - If `len(ost) == 4`, add \([1, ost[0], ost[1], 2, ost[2], ost[3]]\)
- `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \) and has a length of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not.
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is a string representation of the length of `ans`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans`:
```python
for x in ans:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. This means `ans` should not be an empty list.

### Adjusting States
Given the initial states, we need to ensure that `ans` is not empty for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \), `ans` is not an empty list, `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \) and has a length of 1, 2, 3, or 4, `n` is greater than 3, `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not, `results` is a list containing one element, which is a string representation of the length of `ans`**.
