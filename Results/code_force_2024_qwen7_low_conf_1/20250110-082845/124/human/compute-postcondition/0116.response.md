The code appends the string representation of the list `x`, joined by spaces, to the list `results`. The initial state is that `ans` must contain at least one element, and `results` contains all its previous elements plus a new element which is the string representation of the list `x` joined by spaces. Since the initial state already describes that `results` contains the string representation of `x` joined by spaces, no additional changes are made to `results` or `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element; `results` contains all its previous elements plus a new element which is the string representation of the list `x` joined by spaces**
