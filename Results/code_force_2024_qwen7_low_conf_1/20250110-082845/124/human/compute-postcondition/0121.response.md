The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `pos`. The initial state of `ans` is an empty list, and `results` is a string containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` (which is an empty list), each joined by spaces, followed by the length of `ans` as a new appended string (which is "0"). After executing `pos = 0`, the value of `pos` changes, but the values of `ans` and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is an empty list, `results` is "[] 0", `pos` is 0**
