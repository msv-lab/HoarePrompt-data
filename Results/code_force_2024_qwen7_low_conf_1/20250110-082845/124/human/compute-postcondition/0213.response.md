The code snippet appends the string representation of `x` (which is `ans[1]` and `ans[2]` joined by spaces) to the list `results`. 

- `results` initially includes the original elements and the string representation of `ans[1]` and `ans[2]` joined by spaces.
- `ans` must contain at least two elements.
- `t` is `t - 2`.
- `index` is `index + 2`.

After executing the code, `results` will include the new element, which is the string representation of `ans[1]` and `ans[2]` joined by spaces.

Output State: **`ans` must contain at least two elements, `results` includes the original elements and the string representation of `ans[1]` and `ans[2]` joined by spaces, `t` is `t - 2`, `index` is `index + 2`, `results` is updated with the string representation of `ans[1]` and `ans[2]` joined by spaces**
