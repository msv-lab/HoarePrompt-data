Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 8, `per` is the value it was initialized to, `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12, `ost` is a list of length 4, and the length of `ost` is not equal to 2. If `len(ost)` equals 4, then `ans` includes two specific inner lists `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]` and `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`. Otherwise, the value of `ost` remains unchanged.***
