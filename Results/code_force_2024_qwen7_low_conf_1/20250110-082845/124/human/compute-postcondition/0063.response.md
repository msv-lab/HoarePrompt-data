To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and analyze what the loop requires.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):`.
   - This means `i` starts from `per` and goes down to `n // 2` (inclusive), decrementing by 12 each time.
   - For the loop to execute, `per` must be greater than `n // 2`.

2. **Given States**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is 8.
   - `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
   - `data` is unchanged.
   - `ans1` is `[8]`.
   - `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`.
   - `index` is 2.
   - `results` is a list containing the string representations of `['']`.
   - `pos` is 8.
   - `ost` contains all `i` values from 7 to 8 that satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > 8 // 2`.
   - If `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`, then `per` is 7. Otherwise, `per` is 5.

3. **Calculating `n // 2`**:
   - Given `n = 8`, `n // 2 = 4`.

4. **Determining `per`**:
   - Since `n = 8`, we check `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`:
     - `(8 - 1) % 4 = 7 % 4 = 3`, which is not equal to 2.
     - Therefore, `per` is 5.

5. **Loop Condition Check**:
   - The loop condition requires `i` to start from `per` and go down to `n // 2` (inclusive), decrementing by 12 each time.
   - `per` is 5, and `n // 2` is 4.
   - Since 5 is greater than 4, the loop will execute once with `i` set to 5.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `per` should be 5 (which it already is based on the given conditions).

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `per` must be 5.
- `n` is 8.
- All other states (`t`, `a`, `data`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `index`, `results`, `pos`, `ost`) remain unchanged.

State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8**
