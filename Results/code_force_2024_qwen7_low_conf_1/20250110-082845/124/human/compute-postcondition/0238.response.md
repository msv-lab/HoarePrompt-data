Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is at least 3 and a multiple of 4.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `pos` must be less than or equal to the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `pos + 1` to `n`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each value of `i` in this range, if `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2` is true, then `ost` contains `i`.
   - Otherwise, `ost` does not change.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - The loop will execute again if there is an `i` in the range `[pos + 1, n]` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` must be incremented to the next value within the range `[pos + 1, n]`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is an upper bound and does not change within the loop.
   - `pos` must be updated based on the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and also at least `i`.

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

- Since `i` must be at least 3 and a multiple of 4, the smallest possible value for `i` at the start of the next iteration would be the next multiple of 4 after the current `i`.
- `n` remains greater than 3.
- `pos` needs to be set to the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and at least the new value of `i`.

Let's assume the current `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `k` (where `k` is a multiple of 4 and at least 3).

The next multiple of 4 after `k` would be `k + 4` (if `k + 4 <= n`).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is a multiple of 4 and at least 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `pos` must be the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and at least the new value of `i`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's generalize:

State: **`i` is a multiple of 4 and at least 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `pos` must be the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and at least `i`**.

To provide a concrete example, if the current `i` was 8, the next `i` would be 12, and `pos` would be 12.

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is a multiple of 4 and at least 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `pos` must be the smallest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and at least `i`**.
