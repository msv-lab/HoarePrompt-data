`ost` is a list that appends the value of `i`. The code `ost.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `ost`. Given that the current value of `i` is less than or equal to 8, and considering the initial conditions, the updated list `ost` will contain the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and `i > n // 2`; `n` must be greater than 3; `per` must be a value less than or equal to `n // 2` but greater than `n // 2 - 12`; `ost` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the condition, now including the current value of `i`; the current value of `i` is less than or equal to 8.**
