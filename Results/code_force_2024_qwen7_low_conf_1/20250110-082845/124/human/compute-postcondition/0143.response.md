Postcondition: ***`pos` must be less than `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, and `i` is the last value in the range `pos + 1` to `n` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. If the current `i` satisfies the condition, the next value of `i` must still meet the condition and be within the specified range. If `i` does not satisfy the condition, `i` is not updated, and the condition remains as it was before the if-else block.***
