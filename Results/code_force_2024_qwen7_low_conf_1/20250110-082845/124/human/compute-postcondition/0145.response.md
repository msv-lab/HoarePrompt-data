`ost` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the next value in the range `pos + 1` to `n` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. The initial conditions for `pos` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pos` must be less than `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is the next value in the range `pos + 1` to `n` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, and `ost` contains the value of `i`.**
