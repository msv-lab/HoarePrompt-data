Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop structure**: The given loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `ans`.

2. **Determine the initial state required for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `ans` is a non-empty list because the `for` loop iterates over all elements of the list.

3. **Check the provided state**:
   - `per` is 5 (this variable does not affect the loop's execution directly).
   - `n` is 8 (this variable does not affect the loop's execution directly).
   - `ost` is `[4, 0, 0, 0]` (this variable does not affect the loop's execution directly).
   - `results` is `['4']` (this variable does not affect the loop's execution directly).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `ans` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute. Therefore, `ans` should be a non-empty list.

Given the options for `ans` provided (which are either `[4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0], [2, 0, 0]]` or `[4, 0, -4, [1, 0, 4]]` or `[4, 0, -4, [1, 2, 4]]`), we know that `ans` is indeed a non-empty list, so no further adjustment is needed for `ans`.

The remaining variables (`per`, `n`, `ost`, and `results`) do not impact the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

**State: **`ans` is a non-empty list**
