Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element; `results` is a string containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`, each joined by spaces, followed by the length of `ans` as a new appended string.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `ans` is an initial list of elements.
   - `results` starts as an empty string or possibly contains some initial value based on the initial state.
   - `n` and `index` are used to traverse through the lists, but they are not directly modified within the loop.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans`.
   - For each iteration, `results` appends a string representation of `x` (joined by spaces) to itself.

3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - If the loop executes for all elements in `ans`, `results` will contain:
     - The string representation of each element in `ans`, each joined by spaces.
     - The length of `ans` as a new appended string.
   - This is because the loop appends the string representation of each `x` to `results` for each iteration, and finally appends the length of `ans`.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute:**
   - If `ans` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains unchanged from its initial state (if any).

Thus, after the loop has finished executing all iterations, `results` will contain the string representations of all elements in `ans`, each joined by spaces, followed by the length of `ans` as a new appended string.
