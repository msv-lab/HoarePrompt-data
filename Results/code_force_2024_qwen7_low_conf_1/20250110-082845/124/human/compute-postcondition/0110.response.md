`results.append(f'{len(ans)}')` appends the length of the list `ans` as a string to the list `results`. The value of `ans` and `n` remains unchanged. The value of `index` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ans` is the element from `ans2` at the index where `n` is found in `ans1`, `results` is the string representation of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces plus the length of `ans` as a new appended string, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, and `index` is increased by 1.**
