The code `per = n - 1` changes the value of `per` from its original value to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and `i > n // 2`
- `n` is greater than 3
- `pos` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`
- `per` is now `n - 1`
- `ost` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the condition, and `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`

Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and `i > n // 2`, `n` is greater than 3, `pos` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `per` is `n - 1`, `ost` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the condition, and `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`**
