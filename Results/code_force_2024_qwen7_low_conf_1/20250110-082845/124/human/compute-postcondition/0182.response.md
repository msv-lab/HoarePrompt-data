Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 8, `per` is the value it was initialized to, `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12, `ost` is a list containing exactly two elements, and `ans` includes the list `[n // 2 + 12, n // 2 + 8, n // 2 + 4]` since `n // 2 + 12` is the starting value of `i`.***
