`results` is a list with two elements, and `x` is an element from `ans`. The code appends the result of `' '.join(map(str, x))` to the `results` list. Since `x` is an element from `ans`, let's assume `x` is a list of integers or strings. The code converts each element in `x` to a string, joins them with a space, and appends this joined string to `results`.

Let's denote the initial elements of `ans` as `a1, a2, ..., an` and the initial elements of `results` as `r1, r2`.

After executing the code:
- `results` will have its original elements plus the joined string of `x`.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty list with at least one more element; `results` is a list with three elements: `r1, r2, ' '.join(map(str, x))`**
