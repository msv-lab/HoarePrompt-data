Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 8.
- If `ost` is `[8, 8]`, then `ans` is `[[8, 8]]`.
- If `ost` is `[8]`, then `ans` is `[[8, 4, 0]]`.

### Loop Information:
```
for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Function**: The `range(per, n // 2, -12)` generates numbers starting from `per` (inclusive) down to `n // 2` (exclusive) with a step of `-12`.
2. **Current State**: `i` is currently 8.
3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` should decrease by 12 and still satisfy the condition `per <= i < n // 2`.

Given `i` is 8, let's calculate the next value of `i`:
- Decreasing `i` by 12 gives us `i = 8 - 12 = -4`.

Since `-4` does not fall within the valid range defined by the `range` function, we need to consider the constraints:

- `per` is not explicitly given, but it must be less than or equal to 8 (since `i` starts from 8).
- `n // 2` must be greater than 8 (since `i` is currently 8 and the loop is designed to decrement by 12).

For the loop to continue:
- `per` must be such that the range includes 8 (let's assume `per` is 8 for simplicity).
- `n // 2` must be greater than 8, meaning `n` must be greater than 16 (since `n // 2 > 8` implies `n > 16`).

### Adjusted States:
- `n` must be greater than 16.
- `i` will be -4 (though this is outside the loop range, we need to ensure the loop can continue with valid values).
- `ost` and `ans` remain as they were since they are not directly affected by the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 16, `i` is -4 (though not in range), `ost` is `[8, 8]` or `[8]`, and `ans` remains as specified.**

However, to ensure the loop can continue with valid states, we need to adjust the `per` and `n` to ensure the loop can continue properly.

State: **`n` must be greater than 16, `i` is 8, `per` must be less than or equal to 8, and `ost` and `ans` remain as specified.**

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 16, `i` is 8, `per` must be less than or equal to 8, and `ost` and `ans` remain as specified.**
