Postcondition: ***`pos` must be less than `n`, and `n` must be a positive integer. If the current value of `i` is in the range `pos + 1` to `n` and satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, then `ost` contains the value of `i`. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
