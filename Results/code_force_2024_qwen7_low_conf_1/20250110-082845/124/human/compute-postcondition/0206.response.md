Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`
   - `per` is its initial value (not used in this code snippet)
   - `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12` down to `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`
   - `n` is `int(data[index])`
   - `results` is a list of string representations of all elements in `ans`
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `index` is increased by 1

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `ans = ans2[ans1.index(n)]`

   This line of code means that `ans` is being reassigned to the element in `ans2` at the index where `n` is found in `ans1`. 

   Since `n` is defined as `int(data[index])`, let's assume `data[index]` is a value that allows us to find `n`. We know that `ans` was initially defined as a list of lists with elements `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` for a specific range. However, the exact content of `ans2` and `ans1` is not given, so we cannot determine the exact content of `ans` after the assignment.

   Given the initial state, the key changes are:
   - `ans` is now set to `ans2[ans1.index(n)]`.

Since the exact content of `ans2` and `ans1` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact contents of `ans` after the assignment. But we can state the change clearly.

Output State: **`i` is `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is `ans2[ans1.index(n)]`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is a list of string representations of all elements in `ans`, `t` is `t - 1`, `index` is increased by 1**
