The code appends `' '.join(map(str, x))` to the `results` list. Since `x` is not defined in the given context, we assume it is a list. The value of `results` before the operation is `['r1', 'r2', ' '.join(map(str, x))]`. After appending, `results` will contain its previous elements plus the new element.

Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty list with at least two elements; `results` is ['r1', 'r2', ' '.join(map(str, x)), ' '.join(map(str, x))]**
