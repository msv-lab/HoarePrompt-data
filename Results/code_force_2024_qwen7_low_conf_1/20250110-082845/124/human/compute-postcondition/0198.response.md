According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `ans`. The loop can execute again if there are more elements in the list `ans`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `total` is unspecified.
- `i` is 8.
- `per` is its initial value.
- `ans` is a list containing at least one element.
- `n` is greater than 16.
- `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `ans` must contain at least two elements (since it already contains at least one element).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ans` now contains at least two elements.

State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 9, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list containing at least two elements, `n` is greater than 16, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x`.**
