`ans` is appended with the list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`. The value of `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, so the elements added to `ans` are `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `[[i, i + 1, i + 2]]`, `results` is `"[] 0"`, `pos` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`**
