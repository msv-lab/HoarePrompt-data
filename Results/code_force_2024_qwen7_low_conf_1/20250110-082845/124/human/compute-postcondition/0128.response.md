Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `ans` is an empty list (`[]`).
   - `results` is `"[] 0"`.
   - `pos` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 3 to `n-1` with a step of 4.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` becomes `[[i, i + 1, i + 2]]` and `pos` is set to `i + 2`.
   - Otherwise, the values of `ans`, `results`, `pos`, and `n` remain unchanged.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is still an empty list (`[]`).
   - `results` is still `"[] 0"`.
   - `pos` is still 0.
   - `n` is still greater than 3.

5. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 4 each time, we need to determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The last value of `i` was determined based on the condition `i < n // 2 - 2`.

6. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n // 2 - 2`.

7. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - If `i` was the last value before the current iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 4`.

8. **Update the States:**
   - We need to check if the new `i` (i.e., `i + 4`) is still less than `n // 2 - 2`.
   - If it is, then `ans`, `results`, `pos`, and `n` remain unchanged.
   - If it is not, then `ans` becomes `[[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]]` and `pos` is set to `i + 6`.

Given these considerations, let's assume the last value of `i` was such that it was still less than `n // 2 - 2`. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i + 4`, and the conditions will remain unchanged.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ans` is an empty list (`[]`), `results` is `"[] 0"`, `pos` is 0, `n` is greater than 3**.

The values of `i`, `ans`, `results`, `pos`, and `n` remain unchanged because the new `i` (i.e., `i + 4`) is still within the condition where the loop does not change the values.
