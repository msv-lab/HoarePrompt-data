The code appends a formatted string of the length of `ans` to the list `results`. Since the length of `ans` depends on the length of `ost`, we need to consider the different cases for `ost`:

- If `len(ost) == 1`, then `len(ans) = 3` because `ans` is `[4, 0, -4]`.
- If `len(ost) == 2`, then `len(ans) = 4` because `ans` is `[4, 0, -4, [1, 2, 4]]`.
- If `len(ost) == 3` or `len(ost) == 4`, then `len(ans) = 4` because `ans` is `[4, 0, -4, [1, 0, 4]]` or `[4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0], [2, 0, 0]]`.

Since the problem does not specify which case applies, we consider the general case. The most comprehensive case is when `len(ost) == 4`, as it includes all other possibilities. Thus, the length of `ans` will be 4.

Therefore, the output of `f'{len(ans)}'` will be `'4'`, and this value is appended to `results`.

Output State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `ans` is `[4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0], [2, 0, 0]]` (or `[4, 0, -4, [1, 0, 4]]` or `[4, 0, -4, [1, 2, 4]]`), `ost` is `[4, 0, 0, 0]`, `results` is `['4']`.**
