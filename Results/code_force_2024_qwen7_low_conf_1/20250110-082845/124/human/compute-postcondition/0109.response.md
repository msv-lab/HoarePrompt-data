`ans` is reassigned the value of `ans2[ans1.index(n)]`. This means `ans` now holds the element from `ans2` at the index where `n` is found in `ans1`. The value of `results` is still the string representation of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, `n` remains the integer value of `data[index-1]`, and `index` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`ans` is the element from `ans2` at the index where `n` is found in `ans1`, `results` is the string representation of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, and `index` is increased by 1.**
