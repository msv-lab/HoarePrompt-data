Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved**: The key variables involved are `ans` (a non-empty list) and `results` (a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces).

2. **Understand the Loop**: The loop is structured as `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop will iterate `t` times.

3. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are iterations remaining. Since `range(t)` creates a sequence from 0 to `t-1`, the loop will run exactly `t` times.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is a non-empty list.
   - `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are still iterations left to run. Since the loop runs `t` times, if we are at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `t-1` iterations have already occurred. Therefore, there is exactly one iteration left.
   - The state of `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, meaning no modifications are made to `ans` within the loop.
   - The state of `results` also remains unchanged because no operations that modify `results` are performed within the loop body.

Given this analysis, the states do not change for the next iteration since the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `ans` or `results`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces**
