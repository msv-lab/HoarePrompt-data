The code appends a new list `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]` to the variable `ans`. Given the initial state:

- `per` is 5
- `n` is 8
- `ans` is `[4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0]]`
- `ost` is `[4, 0, 0, 0]`

From `ost`, the values of `ost[2]` and `ost[3]` are `0` and `0`, respectively. Thus, the list being appended to `ans` is `[2, 0, 0]`.

After the append operation, `ans` becomes `[4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0], [2, 0, 0]]`.

Output State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `ans` is [4, 0, -4, [1, 4, 0], [2, 0, 0]], `ost` is [4, 0, 0, 0]**
