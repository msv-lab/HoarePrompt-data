The code `ans.append([ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]])` appends the first three elements of the list `ost` to the list `ans`. Given that `len(ost)` is equal to 3, the values of `ost[0]`, `ost[1]`, and `ost[2]` are known and will be added to `ans`.

Here are the specific values:
- `ost[0]` is the first element of `ost`.
- `ost[1]` is the second element of `ost`.
- `ost[2]` is the third element of `ost`.

Since these values are being appended, they will now be part of the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \); `ans` contains all the valid triplets \([i, i - 4, i - 8]\) generated during the loop plus the triplet \([ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]\); `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \); `n` is greater than 3; `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not; `len(ost)` is equal to 3**
