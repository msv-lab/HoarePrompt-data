Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is greater than 16.
- `i` is 8.
- `per` is its initial value.
- `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12 and includes additional elements `[1, 2, None]`, `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]`, `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]`, `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]`, and `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]` if `len(ost)` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively; otherwise, the length of `ans` is 5.

### Loop Execution Condition:
The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans`.

### Analysis:
1. **`n` being greater than 16**: This condition is necessary but not sufficient to determine if the loop will execute because the loop depends on the contents of `ans`.
2. **`i` being 8**: This is the starting value for constructing the `ans` list, but it doesn't directly affect the loop's execution.
3. **`per` being its initial value**: This doesn't affect the loop's execution since it is not used within the loop itself.
4. **`ans` construction**:
   - The list `ans` is constructed based on the values of `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12.
   - Additional elements are added based on the length of `ost`.

### Key Points for Loop Execution:
- **`ans` must not be empty**: For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element.
- **Construction of `ans`**:
  - The inner lists are formed with specific values of `i` (ranging from 8 to `n // 2 + 12`).
  - The additional elements depend on the length of `ost`.

### Required Adjustments:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure `ans` contains at least one element. Given the construction rules, as long as `n > 16`, the loop should have some elements to iterate over.

### Final State Adjustment:
- Ensure `ans` contains at least one element.
- The values of `i` will range from 8 to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12, forming valid inner lists.
- The additional elements based on `ost` will be included if applicable.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 8, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is greater than 16, and the contents of `ans` are constructed based on the specified rules.**

This ensures that the loop can execute with at least one element in `ans`.
