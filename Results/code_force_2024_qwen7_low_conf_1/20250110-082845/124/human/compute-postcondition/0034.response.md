Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 8, `i` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` if `n` is 8, otherwise `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(a_i = i\) for all integers \(i\) in the range \([1, n]\), `data` is unchanged, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans` is `[[8], [3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing the string representations of `['']`, `pos` is 9, `ost` is `[]`. If `i` (which is 7) is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` is modified to include `[7, 8, 9]`; otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` and the other variables remain as initially described.***
