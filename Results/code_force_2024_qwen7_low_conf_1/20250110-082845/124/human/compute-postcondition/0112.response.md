The code snippet `results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a string to the list `results`. The string is created by joining the elements of the list `x` into a single string, with each element converted to a string using `map(str, x)` and then joined with spaces using `' '.join()`.

Given the initial state where `ans` must contain at least one element, this implies that `x` must be a non-empty list (since `ans` is related to `x` in the context of the code snippet). However, the exact values within `x` are not specified. After executing the code, `results` will have a new element added to it, which is the string representation of the elements of `x` separated by spaces.

Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element; `results` contains the previous elements plus a new element which is the string representation of the elements of `x` separated by spaces**
