Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = per` to `i = n // 2` (inclusive), decrementing by 12 each time. For the loop to execute, the condition `per` must be greater than or equal to `n // 2`.

2. **Determine the Value of `per`**:
   - `per` is determined based on the value of `n`:
     - If `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`, then `per = n - 1`.
     - Otherwise, if `(n - 2) % 4 == 2`, then `per = n - 2`.
     - Otherwise, `per = n - 3`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Condition is Met**:
   - We need to ensure that `per >= n // 2` to guarantee the loop executes.

Given these points, let's construct the required states:

- `n` should be such that the value of `per` (based on the given conditions) is at least `n // 2`.

Let's analyze the conditions for `per`:
- If `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`, then `per = n - 1`.
  - This means `n - 1` must be at least `n // 2`, hence `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2) + 1` (which simplifies to `n > 1`).
- If `(n - 2) % 4 == 2`, then `per = n - 2`.
  - This means `n - 2` must be at least `n // 2`, hence `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2) + 2` (which simplifies to `n > 2`).
- If neither of the above conditions is met, then `per = n - 3`.
  - This means `n - 3` must be at least `n // 2`, hence `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2) + 3` (which simplifies to `n > 3`).

In all cases, the minimum value of `n` that ensures the loop condition `per >= n // 2` is met is `n > 3`.

Thus, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 3 and the specific value of `per` will be derived from the conditions given.

So, the required state to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 3**.
