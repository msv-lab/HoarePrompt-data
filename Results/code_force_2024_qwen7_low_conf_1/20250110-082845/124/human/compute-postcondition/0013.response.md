The code appends a formatted string to the list `results`. The string is created using `f'{len(ans)}'`, where `ans` is `[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]`. The length of `ans` is 2. Therefore, `results.append('2')`.

Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer, `n` is 8, `a` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], `data` is unchanged, `ans1` is [8], `ans2` is [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]], `index` is 2, `results` is ['2'], `ans` is [[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]**
