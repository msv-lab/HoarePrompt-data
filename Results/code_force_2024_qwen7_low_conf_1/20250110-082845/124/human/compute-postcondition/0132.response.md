Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `ans` is an empty list (`[]`)
- `results` is `"[] 0"`
- `pos` is 0
- `n` is greater than 3

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(3, n - 1, 4):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 3 up to but not including `n-1` with a step of 4.
2. **Initial Values**: At the start of the first iteration, `i` would be 3 (since the range starts at 3).
3. **State After Previous Iteration**: The exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration isn't specified, but we know `n` is greater than 3. Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`.

### Determining the Next Iteration:

1. **Value of `i`**: The loop increments `i` by 4 each time it executes. Therefore, if `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be `i_prev + 4`.
2. **Condition for Continuing the Loop**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. We need to check if `i_prev + 4` is still less than `n - 1`.
3. **Update States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i_prev + 4`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 3.
   - `ans`, `results`, and `pos` remain unchanged unless the condition `i > n // 2 - 2` is met. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute, these variables don't change.

### Conclusion:

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that the loop can continue based on the value of `i`. If `i_prev + 4` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can continue.

Given that `n` is greater than 3, and assuming the loop condition holds for the next value of `i`, the state adjustments are:

- `i` will be `i_prev + 4`
- `n` must still be greater than 3

Since the loop body doesn't change `ans`, `results`, or `pos` unless the condition `i > n // 2 - 2` is met, these states remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`ans` is an empty list (`[]`), `results` is `"[] 0"`, `pos` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 4`, `n` must be greater than 3**
