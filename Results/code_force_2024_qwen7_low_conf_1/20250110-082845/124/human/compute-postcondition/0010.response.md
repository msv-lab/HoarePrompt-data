The value of `index` is incremented by 1. Initially, `index` is 1, so after incrementing, `index` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is `value_of_data_at_index_1`, `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(a_i = i\) for all integers \(i\) in the range \([1, n]\), `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is `2`, and `results` is an empty list.**
