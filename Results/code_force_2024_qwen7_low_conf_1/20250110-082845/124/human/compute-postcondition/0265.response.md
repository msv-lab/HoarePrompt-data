Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies the condition `i > n // 2`.
   - `ans` contains either `[12, 8, 4]` if `i` is 12, or includes the current value of `i` which is less than or equal to 8.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `per` must be a value less than or equal to `n // 2` but greater than `n // 2 - 12`.
   - `ost` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the condition, now including the current value of `i`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop starts from `per` and goes down by `-12` until it reaches a value less than `n // 2`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, the current value of `i` (at the start of the loop) must be within the range specified by `range(per, n // 2, -12)`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is the largest multiple of 4 that satisfies the conditions.
   - `per` is a value less than or equal to `n // 2` but greater than `n // 2 - 12`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.
   - `ost` includes the current value of `i`.

5. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 12 each time, the next value of `i` will be `i - 12`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i - 12` must still be within the range defined by `per` to `n // 2`.
   - Given that `i` is the largest multiple of 4 that satisfies the conditions, the next valid `i` will be the next lower multiple of 4 that also satisfies the conditions.

6. **Updated State:**
   - `i` becomes `i - 12`.
   - `per` remains the same since the loop's starting point does not change per iteration.
   - `n` remains greater than 3.
   - `ost` includes the new value of `i`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3, satisfies `i > n // 2`, and is `i - 12`.
- `ans` contains either `[12, 8, 4]` if `i - 12` is 12, or includes the current value of `i - 12` which is less than or equal to 8.
- `n` must still be greater than 3.
- `per` must still be a value less than or equal to `n // 2` but greater than `n // 2 - 12`.
- `ost` includes the new value of `i`.

**Answer:**
State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3, satisfies `i > n // 2`, and is `i - 12`, `ans` contains either `[12, 8, 4]` if `i - 12` is 12, or includes the current value of `i - 12` which is less than or equal to 8, `n` must be greater than 3, `per` must be a value less than or equal to `n // 2` but greater than `n // 2 - 12`, `ost` includes the new value of `i`.**
