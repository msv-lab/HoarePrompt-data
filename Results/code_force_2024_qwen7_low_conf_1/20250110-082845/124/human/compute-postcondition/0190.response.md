Let's go through the code step by step:

- Initial State:
  - `n` is greater than 16
  - `i` is 8
  - `per` is the value it was initialized to (though its exact value is not needed for this task)
  - `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12, and the new element `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]` has been appended to `ans`.
  - `ost` is an empty list with a length not equal to 2, and the length of `ost` is now 4.

- Code to execute:
  ```python
  ans.append([2, ost[2], ost[3]])
  ```

- Analysis:
  - `ans` is being appended with a new list `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`.
  - Since `ost` is currently a list of length 4, `ost[2]` and `ost[3]` will refer to the third and fourth elements respectively.

- Updated State:
  - The length of `ost` remains 4.
  - The `ans` list now includes an additional element `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`.

- Final Output State:
  - `n` is greater than 16
  - `i` is 8
  - `per` is the value it was initialized to
  - `ans` is a list of lists including the new element `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]` and now also includes `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`
  - `ost` is a list of length 4

Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 8, `per` is the value it was initialized to, `ans` is a list of lists where one of the inner lists is [1, ost[0], ost[1]], and another inner list is [2, ost[2], ost[3]], `ost` is a list of length 4**
