Postcondition: ***`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies `i > n // 2`. If `i > 8`, `ans` contains `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`. If `i` is 16, `ans` is [12, 8, 4]. `per` must be a value less than or equal to `n // 2` but greater than `n // 2 - 12`. `ost` includes the new value of `i`.***
