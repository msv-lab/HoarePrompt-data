The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `index` and retains the values of all other variables from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12` down to `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is a list of string representations of all elements in `ans`, `t` is `t - 1`, `index` is increased by 1**
