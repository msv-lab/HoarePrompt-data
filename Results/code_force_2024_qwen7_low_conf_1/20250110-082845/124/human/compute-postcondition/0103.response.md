According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `ans`. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `ans`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans` is a non-empty list with at least one more element.
- `results` is a list with three elements: `r1, r2, ' '.join(map(str, x))`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still have at least one more element.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- `ans` should have at least two elements (one more than the previous iteration).
- `results` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the iteration count or the elements of `ans`.

State: **`ans` is a non-empty list with at least two elements; `results` is a list with three elements: `r1, r2, ' '.join(map(str, x))`**
