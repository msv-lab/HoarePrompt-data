`t` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. Since `data[index]` is a list of strings, `t` will be the integer value of the first element of `data[index]`. Given the initial state, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `index` is 0, so `t` will be the integer value of `data[0][0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0][0]`, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 30000, `a` is an array of n integers where a_i = i for all integers i in the range [1, n], and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]], `index` is 0**
