The code snippet `results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a string to the list `results`. Here, `x` is not defined in the given initial state, so we assume it is a variable that was previously defined and its value is being used in this line of code. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `x`, we cannot determine the exact string that will be appended to `results`. We know that `x` is likely a list of integers, as the `map(str, x)` function converts each element of `x` to a string. The resulting string will be a space-separated string of these integers.

Given the initial state, the only change is to the `results` list. Since `results` initially contains one element, which is a string representation of the length of `ans`, and now an additional element is appended, the new `results` list will contain two elements: the original element and the new string.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \), `ans` is not an empty list, `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \) and has a length of 1, 2, 3, or 4, `n` is greater than 3, `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first element is a string representation of the length of `ans` and the second element is a space-separated string of integers from `x`.**
