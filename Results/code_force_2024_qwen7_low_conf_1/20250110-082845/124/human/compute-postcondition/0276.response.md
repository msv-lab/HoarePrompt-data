Postcondition: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and satisfies \( i > n // 2 \); `ans` contains all the valid triplets \([i, i - 4, i - 8]\) generated during the loop; `ost` contains all the values of \( i \) that were added when \( i \leq 8 \). Currently, `ost` has exactly one element; `n` is greater than 3; `per` is \( n - 1 \) if \( (n - 1) \% 4 == 2 \), otherwise it is either \( n - 2 \) or \( n - 3 \) depending on whether \( (n - 2) \% 4 == 2 \) or not.**
