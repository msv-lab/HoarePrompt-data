The code appends a list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to the `ans` list. Given that `i` is 4, the list `[4, 4 - 4, 4 - 8]` simplifies to `[4, 0, -4]`. Since `ans` was initially unchanged, the append operation adds this list to `ans`. The values of `i` and `per` remain unchanged, and `ost` includes the new value of `i` which is 4.

Output State: **`i` is 4; `per` is 10; `ans` is `[ [4, 0, -4] ]; `ost` includes the new value of `i` which is 4**
