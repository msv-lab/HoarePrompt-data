`ost` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `i` is an integer greater than 4 and the condition `i > 8` is false, the value of `i` must be between 4 and 8 (inclusive). However, since `i` is specifically stated to be an integer greater than 4 and the condition `i > 8` is false, the only possible value for `i` is 5, 6, 7. After appending, the list `ost` will contain this value. The states of the other variables (`per`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`per` is 5, `n` is 8, `i` is an integer greater than 4, `ost` contains the value 5, 6, or 7.**
