`ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. Since `i` is 4, the list `ost` now contains the value 4. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`per` and `ans`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `per` is 10, `ans` remains unchanged, `ost` is [4]**
