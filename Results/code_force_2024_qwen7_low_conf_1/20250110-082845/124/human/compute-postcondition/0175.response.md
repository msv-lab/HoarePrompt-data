`ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 8) to the list `ost`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated value of `i` remains 8, and `n` must still be greater than 16, `per` must still be less than or equal to 8, and `ost` now contains the value 8.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 16, `i` is 8, `per` must be less than or equal to 8, `ost` is [8], and `ans` remains as specified.**
