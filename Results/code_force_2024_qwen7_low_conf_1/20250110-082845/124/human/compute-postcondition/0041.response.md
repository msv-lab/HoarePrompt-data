Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is unchanged, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` if `n` is 8, otherwise `a` is an array of `n` integers where \(a_i = i\) for all integers \(i\) in the range \([1, n]\), `data` is unchanged, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing the string representations of `['']`, `ans` contains all sublists `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` for each valid `i` starting from 3 with a step of 4 until `i` no longer satisfies `i > n // 2 - 2`, `pos` is the last value of `i + 2` that was appended to `ans`, `ost` is `[]`, `pos < n`, and the current value of `i` satisfies \((i \% 2 \neq 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > n // 2\)**
