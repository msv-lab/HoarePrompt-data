Postcondition: ***`per` is 5, `n` is 8. If `i` is an integer greater than 8, `ans` contains `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` where `i` is an integer greater than 8, `i - 4` is an integer greater than 4, and `i - 8` is an integer greater than 0. Otherwise, `i` is an integer greater than 4, and `ans` contains the value 5, 6, or 7.***
