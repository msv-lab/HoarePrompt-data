Postcondition: ***`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and `i > n // 2`, `n` is greater than 3, `pos` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `per` is `n - 1` if `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`, otherwise it is either `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on whether `(n - 2) % 4 == 2` or not, `ost` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the condition.***
