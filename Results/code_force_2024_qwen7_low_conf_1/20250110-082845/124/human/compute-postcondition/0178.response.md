Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 8, `per` is the value it was initialized to, `ans` is a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` with `i` ranging from 8 down to `n // 2 + 12` in steps of -12, `ost` is a list containing the values of `i` from `n // 2 + 12` down to `n // 2 + 1` in steps of -12 if any such values exist, otherwise `ost` is an empty list.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization and Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being set to `per` and decreases by 12 each iteration until `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
   - If `i > n // 2` and `i > 8`, the value `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` is appended to `ans`.
   - If `i` is between `n // 2 + 1` and 8, the value `i` is appended to `ost`.

2. **Final State After Loop Completion:**
   - Since `i` decreases by 12 each time, the loop will eventually reach a point where `i` is no longer greater than `n // 2`. This means `i` will end up being 8 (as per the output states provided).
   - At this point, `i` will continue to decrease by 12, which will not be valid since `i` would become less than `n // 2`. Therefore, the loop terminates when `i` is 8.
   - The loop will append all valid `[i, i-4, i-8]` values to `ans` and all remaining `i` values to `ost` until `i` reaches 8.
   - `n` must be greater than 16 for the loop to run at least three times, ensuring that `i` reaches 8.

3. **Variables' Final Values:**
   - `n`: The original value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - `per`: The value of `per` remains unchanged as it is only set at the beginning and doesn't change within the loop.
   - `ans`: Contains all valid `[i, i-4, i-8]` combinations.
   - `ost`: Contains all valid `i` values that did not meet the condition to be in `ans`.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop will reflect these conditions.
