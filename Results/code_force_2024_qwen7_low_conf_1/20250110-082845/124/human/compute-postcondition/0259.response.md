Postcondition: **`i` is the largest multiple of 4 that is at least 3 and `i > n // 2`. `n` must be greater than 3. `per` must be a value less than or equal to `n // 2` but greater than `n // 2 - 12`. `ost` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the condition. The current value of `i` is greater than 8 and more than 8.**
