According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and the list `ans`. The loop iterates over each element in `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list containing at least two elements, `n` is greater than 16, and `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `ans` must contain at least three elements (since it already contains at least two elements, only one more element is needed).
2. The next element `x` from `ans` must be used in the loop.

Given these conditions, we can adjust the states as follows:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 10.
- `per` remains unchanged as it is its initial value.
- `ans` must now contain at least three elements.
- `n` remains greater than 16.
- `results` will contain an additional element, which will be the next element from `ans` (let's call it `x_new`).

State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 10, `per` is its initial value, `ans` is a list containing at least three elements, `n` is greater than 16, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x_new`**
