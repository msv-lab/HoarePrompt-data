The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables directly but changes the flow of the loop. Given that no variables are being reassigned or modified within the context of this `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `int(data[index]) // 2 + 12`, `per` is its initial value, `ans` contains all the elements it had before the loop started, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string representations of all elements in `ans` joined by spaces, `t` is `t - (number of elements in ans)`, `index` is `index + (number of elements in ans)`**
