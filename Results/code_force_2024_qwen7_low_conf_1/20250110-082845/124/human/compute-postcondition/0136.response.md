To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop runs and how the variables change within the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Conditions and Iterations:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `3` to `n - 1` with a step of `4`.
   - The condition `if i > n // 2 - 2:` checks whether the current `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`.

2. **Behavior of Variables:**
   - `ans`: Initially empty, it gets appended with `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` if the condition is met.
   - `pos`: Updated to `i + 2` if the condition is met.
   - `i` increases by `4` each iteration unless the condition is not met, in which case the values of `ans`, `results`, `pos`, and `n` remain unchanged.

3. **Final Values:**
   - The loop will continue until `i` exceeds `n - 1`.
   - For each valid `i` (where `i > n // 2 - 2`), `ans` will get updated to `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` and `pos` will be set to `i + 2`.
   - If no valid `i` satisfies the condition, `ans` and `pos` will remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:

- **If the loop executes at least once:**
  - `ans` will contain a list of lists where each inner list is of the form `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` for valid `i`.
  - `pos` will be the last value of `i + 2` that was updated.
  - `n` must be greater than 3.

- **If the loop does not execute (i.e., no valid `i` found):**
  - `ans` remains empty (`[]`).
  - `results` remains `"[] 0"`.
  - `pos` remains `0`.
  - `n` must still be greater than 3.

### Conclusion:

**Output State:**
```plaintext
ans is a list of lists, where each inner list is [i, i + 1, i + 2] for valid i, or [] if no valid i is found, 'pos' is the last value of i + 2 that was updated or 0 if no valid i is found, 'results' is "[] 0", 'n' is a positive integer greater than 3.
```

This ensures that all possible scenarios are covered based on the loop's behavior and the given conditions.
