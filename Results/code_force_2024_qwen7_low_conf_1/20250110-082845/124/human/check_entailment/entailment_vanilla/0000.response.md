Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure it meets the problem requirements. Let's break down the solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly and handles the number of test cases (`t`) and the size of arrays (`n`).

2. **Output Format**: The program outputs the number of operations followed by the specific operations in the required format.

3. **Operation Generation Logic**:
   - The code generates a sequence of operations that transform the initial array into a form where the GCDs of all subsequences meet the specified criteria.
   - The logic seems to aim at ensuring that the final array allows the generation of all GCDs from 1 to `n`.

4. **Bounds Check**: The operations are designed to keep `a_i \le 10^{18}` which is a requirement.

5. **Guaranteed Solution Existence**: The problem statement guarantees that a solution always exists, and the code appears to generate a valid sequence of operations.

By analyzing the provided example, we can see that the generated operations are consistent with the problem requirements:
- For each test case, the number of operations is within the allowed limit.
- The resulting array allows generating GCDs from 1 to `n`.
- All elements of the array remain bounded by `10^{18}`.

Based on the above reasoning, the program seems to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
