### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program against the problem description and the given example.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of each array. This part is correct.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the number of operations followed by the specific operations in the required format. This part is also correct.

3. **Operation Generation Logic**:
   - The code aims to generate a sequence of operations that transform the initial array into a form where the GCDs of all subsequences meet the specified criteria. However, there are some issues with the logic.

   - **Issue 1: Fixed Operations**:
     - The code uses fixed sets of operations for certain values of `n`. Specifically, it checks if `n` is in `ans1` and uses corresponding operations from `ans2`. While this works for specific values, it doesn't handle all possible `n` values effectively.

   - **Issue 2: Operation Construction**:
     - The operations are constructed based on a series of conditional checks and loops. However, the logic to ensure that all GCDs from 1 to `n` are covered is not fully robust. For example, the logic for handling different lengths of `ost` (the remaining elements) may not always produce the optimal sequence of operations.

   - **Issue 3: Bounds Check**:
     - The operations are designed to keep `a_i \le 10^{18}`, but the current logic does not explicitly enforce this condition. It relies on the operations being chosen in a way that naturally keeps the values bounded, which is not guaranteed.

   - **Issue 4: Guaranteed Solution Existence**:
     - The problem guarantees that a solution always exists, but the current implementation does not always produce a valid sequence of operations for all `n`.

4. **Verification with the Example**:
   - Let's verify the example provided in the problem description.
     - For `n = 3`, the output is:
       ```
       1
       1 2 3
       ```
     - For `n = 4`, the output is:
       ```
       1
       1 3 4
       ```
     - For `n = 7`, the output is:
       ```
       3
       3 5 7
       5 6 7
       2 3 4
       ```
   - The operations do not always cover all GCDs from 1 to `n`. For example, for `n = 7`, the operations do not ensure that all GCDs from 1 to 7 are covered.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not fully meet the problem requirements. While it sometimes produces valid sequences of operations, it does not guarantee that all GCDs from 1 to `n` are covered for all possible values of `n`. Additionally, the logic for constructing the operations is not robust enough to handle all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
