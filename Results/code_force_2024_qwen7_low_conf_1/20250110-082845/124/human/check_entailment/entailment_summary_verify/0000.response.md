### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the program and its logic against the problem description and the provided example. The goal is to verify if the program indeed generates a sequence of operations that meets the criteria of covering all numbers from 1 to \( n \) in the GCDs of all subsequences with a size greater than 1.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Operations**: The program should perform at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rf-type: text/x-python
