You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Given an integer n , you construct an array a of n integers, where a_i = i for
all integers i in the range [1, n] . An operation on this array is defined as
follows:

  * Select three distinct indices i , j , and k from the array, and let x = a_i , y = a_j , and z = a_k . 
  * Update the array as follows: a_i = \operatorname{lcm}(y, z) , a_j = \operatorname{lcm}(x, z) , and a_k = \operatorname{lcm}(x, y) , where \operatorname{lcm} represents the least common multiple. 

Your task is to provide a possible sequence of operations, containing at most
\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5 operations such that after executing these
operations, if you create a set containing the greatest common divisors (GCDs)
of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 , then all numbers from 1 to n
should be present in this set.

After all the operations a_i \le 10^{18} should hold for all 1 \le i \le n .

We can show that an answer always exists.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^2 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^{4} ) — the length of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^{4} .

Output

The first line should contain an integer k (0 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{6}
\rfloor + 5 ) — where k is the number of operations.

The next k lines should contain the description of each operation i.e. 3
integers i , j and k , where 1 \leq i, j, k \leq n and all must be distinct.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    4
    
    7

Output

    1
    1 2 3
    1
    1 3 4
    3
    3 5 7
    5 6 7
    2 3 4

Note

In the third test case, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] .

First operation:

i = 3 , j = 5 , k = 7

x = 3 , y = 5 , z = 7 .

a = [1, 2, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), 4, \operatorname{lcm}(x,z), 6,
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)] = [1, 2, \color{red}{35}, 4, \color{red}{21}, 6,
\color{red}{15}] .

Second operation:

i = 5 , j = 6 , k = 7

x = 21 , y = 6 , z = 15 .

a = [1, 2, 35, 4, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), \operatorname{lcm}(x,z),
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)] = [1, 2, 35, 4, \color{red}{30}, \color{red}{105},
\color{red}{42}] .

Third operation:

i = 2 , j = 3 , k = 4

x = 2 , y = 35 , z = 4 .

a = [1, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), \operatorname{lcm}(x,z),
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y), 30, 105, 42] = [1, \color{red}{140}, \color{red}{4},
\color{red}{70}, 30, 105, 42] .

Subsequences whose GCD equal to i is as follows:

\gcd(a_1, a_2) = \gcd(1, 140) = 1

\gcd(a_3, a_4) = \gcd(4, 70) = 2

\gcd(a_5, a_6, a_7) = \gcd(30, 105, 42) = 3

\gcd(a_2, a_3) = \gcd(140, 4) = 4

\gcd(a_2, a_4, a_5, a_6) = \gcd(140, 70, 30, 105) = 5

\gcd(a_5, a_7) = \gcd(30, 42) = 6

\gcd(a_2, a_4, a_6, a_7) = \gcd(140, 70, 105, 42) = 7

# Execution Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \), and for each test case, an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it constructs a list of lists `ans` where each inner list represents a subsequence of integers such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each subsequence covers all numbers from 1 to \( n \). The function ensures that the length of `ans` is minimal and that all elements in `a` are within the limit \( 10^{18} \). If \( n \) is in the predefined list `ans1`, it retrieves a precomputed solution from `ans2`. Otherwise, it generates a new solution based on specific rules and appends it to `results`. Finally, it writes the results to standard output in a specified format. The function handles edge cases such as when the number of elements in `ost` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and it ensures that the generated subsequences satisfy the required conditions. However, it does not explicitly check if all elements in `a` are within the limit \( 10^{18} \) during the execution, only ensuring this condition through the construction of `ans`.
