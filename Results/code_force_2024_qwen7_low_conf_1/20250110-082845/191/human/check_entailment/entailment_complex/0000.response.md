Reasoning:
1. The problem involves calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard, given some initial moves that ensure no two rooks attack each other.
2. The solution provided correctly implements the logic for determining the number of valid configurations. Specifically:
   - It reads input values for each test case and processes them iteratively.
   - It maintains sets of used rows and columns to track occupied positions.
   - For each move, it updates the sets and ensures that mirrored moves are accounted for.
   - It calculates the number of free rows and columns, and then determines the minimum between these two.
   - It computes the product of numbers from 1 to the minimum value (inclusive) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. The code correctly handles the constraints and examples provided, ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem statement.
4. The solution is modular and efficient, given the constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the provided program appears to correctly solve the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
