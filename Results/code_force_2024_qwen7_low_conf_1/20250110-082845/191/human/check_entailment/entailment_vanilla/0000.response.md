Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. It processes each test case by extracting the values of `n` and `k`.
3. For each test case, it initializes sets `rows` and `cols` to keep track of the occupied rows and columns, respectively.
4. It iterates through the moves, adding the row and column indices to the sets. If the row and column indices are different, it adds them again, reflecting the mirroring effect of the computer's moves.
5. It calculates the number of free rows (`free_rows`) and free columns (`free_cols`).
6. It determines `m`, the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, which represents the number of additional rooks that can be placed without attacking each other.
7. The program then calculates the factorial of `m` modulo `10^9 + 7` to determine the number of possible final configurations.
8. Finally, it appends the result to the `results` list and prints each result at the end.

The logic and implementation of the program match the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
