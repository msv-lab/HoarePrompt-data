Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into tokens. This handles the multiple test cases and their respective inputs.
   - It iterates through each test case, extracting `n` and `k` for each, and then the coordinates `r` and `c` for each of the `k` moves.

2. **Tracking Used Rows and Columns:**
   - Sets `rows` and `cols` are used to keep track of all unique row and column indices used by the rooks placed so far.
   - For each move `(r, c)`, the program adds `r` and `c` to the sets. If `r` is not equal to `c`, it also adds `c` and `r` to ensure symmetry when the computer places its rook.

3. **Calculating Free Rows and Columns:**
   - The program calculates the number of free rows (`free_rows`) and columns (`free_cols`) by subtracting the sizes of the sets `rows` and `cols` from `n`.

4. **Determining Minimum Free Space:**
   - The minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` (`m`) determines the number of positions where additional rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

5. **Computing the Result:**
   - The program computes the number of possible final configurations using the factorial of `m` modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is done using a loop that multiplies numbers from `1` to `m` and takes the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

6. **Outputting Results:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, ensuring the output is correct and within the specified format.

### Summary:
The program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description. It accurately tracks the placement of rooks, calculates the available spaces, and computes the number of valid configurations as required. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem specification.
