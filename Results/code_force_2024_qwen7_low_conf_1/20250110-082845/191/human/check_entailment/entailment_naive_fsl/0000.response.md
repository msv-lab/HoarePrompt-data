Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic for determining `free_rows` and `free_cols` and then calculating the number of ways to place rooks is flawed.

The program assumes that the number of free rows and columns can be calculated by subtracting the number of used rows and columns from the total number of rows and columns. However, this approach does not account for the symmetry in the board due to the mirroring behavior of the computer. When a rook is placed at position (r, c), the computer places a rook at (c, r). This means that the number of free rows and columns that are actually available for placing additional rooks is less than simply subtracting the used ones.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to consider the following:

1. For each row and column, keep track of whether it is free or not.
2. After accounting for the initial moves, determine the number of free rows and columns that are not mirrored.
3. Calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the free rows and columns, considering the mirroring behavior.

The provided solution does not handle these considerations properly, leading to incorrect results. For example, in the given test case:

- For the 4x4 grid with one move at (1, 2), the program calculates the number of free rows and columns incorrectly, leading to the wrong number of configurations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
