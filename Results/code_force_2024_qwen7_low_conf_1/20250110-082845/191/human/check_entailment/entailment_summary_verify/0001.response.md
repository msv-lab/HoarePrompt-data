### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Reading and Processing:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.read` to read the entire input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`), the size of the board (`n`), the number of moves (`k`), and the positions of the rooks.

2. **Tracking Occupied Rows and Columns:**
   - The program maintains sets `rows` and `cols` to keep track of occupied rows and columns.
   - When a rook is placed at `(r, c)`, the program adds both `r` and `c` to these sets. This ensures that if the rook is mirrored, both `r` and `c` are considered occupied.

3. **Calculating Free Rows and Columns:**
   - The program calculates the number of free rows (`free_rows`) and free columns (`free_cols`).
   - It correctly identifies the minimum of these two values, `m`, which represents the number of additional non-attacking rooks that can be placed.

4. **Calculating Possible Configurations:**
   - The program calculates the factorial of `m` modulo `10^9 + 7` to determine the number of possible final configurations.
   - This step is crucial and aligns with the problem statement, ensuring that no two rooks attack each other.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the number of available rows or columns might be zero, ensuring the calculation remains valid.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary. The calculations and logic steps are well-matched and correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description, function summary, and the logical steps taken in the code.
