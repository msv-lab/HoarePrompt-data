You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `results` is a list containing the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD` for each iteration, where `m` is the minimum of `n - len(rows)` and `n - len(cols)` for each iteration, `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices `r` and column indices `c` encountered during all loop iterations, `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices `c` and row indices `r` encountered during all loop iterations, `index` is the final value of `index` after all iterations (`val + 2 * t`), `k` is the total number of pairs processed during all iterations, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, and the loop executes at least `len(results)` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (the size of the board), an integer `k` (the number of rook pairs), and pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i` (representing row and column indices of rooks). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of non-attacking rooks that can be placed on the board by considering the available rows and columns after placing the given rook pairs. It then computes the product of all integers from 1 to this minimum number modulo a constant `MOD` and stores these results in a list. Finally, it prints each result from the list. The function handles edge cases where the number of available rows or columns might be zero and ensures that no two rooks attack each other based on the given rules.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. It processes each test case by extracting the values of `n` and `k`.
3. For each test case, it initializes sets `rows` and `cols` to keep track of the occupied rows and columns, respectively.
4. It iterates through the moves, adding the row and column indices to the sets. If the row and column indices are different, it adds them again, reflecting the mirroring effect of the computer's moves.
5. It calculates the number of free rows (`free_rows`) and free columns (`free_cols`).
6. It determines `m`, the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, which represents the number of additional rooks that can be placed without attacking each other.
7. The program then calculates the factorial of `m` modulo `10^9 + 7` to determine the number of possible final configurations.
8. Finally, it appends the result to the `results` list and prints each result at the end.

The logic and implementation of the program match the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
