### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is done correctly and efficiently, especially for large inputs.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program processes each test case by extracting the values of `n` and `k`. This is done accurately and is essential for determining the size of the board and the number of moves already played.

3. **Tracking Occupied Rows and Columns**:
   - Sets `rows` and `cols` are initialized to keep track of the occupied rows and columns, respectively. This is crucial for ensuring that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The program correctly updates these sets as it iterates through the moves. If the row and column indices are different, it adds both to the sets, reflecting the mirroring effect of the computer's moves.

4. **Calculating Free Rows and Columns**:
   - The number of free rows (`free_rows`) and free columns (`free_cols`) is calculated correctly by subtracting the size of the sets from `n`.

5. **Determining the Minimum Number of Non-Attacking Rooks**:
   - The variable `m` is correctly determined as the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, representing the maximum number of additional non-attacking rooks that can be placed.

6. **Calculating the Number of Possible Configurations**:
   - The program calculates the factorial of `m` modulo `10^9 + 7` to determine the number of possible final configurations. This is done using a simple loop and the modulo operation, ensuring that the result fits within the required constraints.

7. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the number of available rows or columns might be zero, ensuring that the calculations do not lead to errors.

8. **Outputting Results**:
   - The program appends the result to the `results` list and prints each result at the end, ensuring that the output matches the required format.

Given the detailed analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and the correctness of its implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
