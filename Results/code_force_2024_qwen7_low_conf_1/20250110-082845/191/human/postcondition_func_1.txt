The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `x` and `mod`. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `x` modulo `mod` using the formula \( x^{(mod - 2)} \mod mod \). The function returns the result of this calculation. This is essentially finding a number \( y \) such that \( x \cdot y \equiv 1 \mod mod \), assuming \( x \) and `mod` are coprime. If `mod` is 1 or `x` and `mod` are not coprime, the function will still execute but the result might not have a meaningful multiplicative inverse in the usual sense.
