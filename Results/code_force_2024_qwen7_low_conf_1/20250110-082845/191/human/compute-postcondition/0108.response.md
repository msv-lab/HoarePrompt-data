The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `c`. Since `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, the value of `data[index + 1]` is unknown, but it will be converted to an integer and assigned to `c`. The value of `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
