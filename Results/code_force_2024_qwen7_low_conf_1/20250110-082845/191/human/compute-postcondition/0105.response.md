The code `cols = set()` creates a new empty set named `cols`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`free_rows` is `val - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `val - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, `result` is `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing `[result]` and a new result appended to it, `n` is `val`, `index` is `index + 2`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `rows` is an empty set, `cols` is an empty set**
