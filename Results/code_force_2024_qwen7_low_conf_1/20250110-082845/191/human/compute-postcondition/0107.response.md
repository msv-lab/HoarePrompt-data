The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `r` after converting it to an integer. Since the initial state of `k` is a positive integer and `data[index]` is not mentioned, `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only variable affected is `r`, which is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
