The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` converted to an integer to the variable `c`. Based on the initial state, `k` is a positive integer, `rows` is a tuple `{r, c}`, `index` is incremented by 4, and `c` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration. The state of `cols` depends on whether `r` (from the initial `rows` tuple) is equal to `c` or not.

Given the initial conditions, let's update the variables:
- `k` remains unchanged and is a positive integer.
- `rows` remains `{r, c}`.
- `index` is now `index + 4`.
- `c` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is {r, c}, `index` is index + 4, `c` is the integer value of data[index + 1]**
