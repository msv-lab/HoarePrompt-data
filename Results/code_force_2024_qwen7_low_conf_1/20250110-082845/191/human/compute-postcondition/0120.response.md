The code `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. Given that `rows` initially contains `r` and `c`, adding `r` again does not change the set because sets cannot contain duplicate elements. The value of `index` is increased by 2 more (making it increased by 4 in total from the initial increase by 2), `c` remains the same as its value from the previous iteration (since it is derived from `data[index + 1]` and that value has not been altered), and `cols` remains unchanged unless `r` equals `c`, in which case it would add both `r` and `c` to the set.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is {r, c}, `index` is increased by 4, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration, `cols` is a set containing the values `c` and `r` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise `cols` remains unchanged.**
