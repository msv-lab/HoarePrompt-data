Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (the size of the board), an integer `k` (the number of rook pairs), and pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i` (representing row and column indices of rooks). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of non-attacking rooks that can be placed on the board by considering the available rows and columns after placing the given rook pairs. It then computes the product of all integers from 1 to this minimum number modulo a constant `MOD` and stores these results in a list. Finally, it prints each result from the list. The function handles edge cases where the number of available rows or columns might be zero and ensures that no two rooks attack each other based on the given rules.**
