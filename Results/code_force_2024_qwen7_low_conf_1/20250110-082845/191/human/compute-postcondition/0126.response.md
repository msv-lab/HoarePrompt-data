The code `r = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `r`. Given the initial state:

- `k` is a positive integer,
- `rows` is a dictionary with keys `r` and `c`,
- `index` is `index + 4`,
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration,
- `cols` contains the value `r` if `r` is not equal to `c`; otherwise, `cols` remains unchanged and includes the value of `c`.

Since `r` is now assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, and no other variables are directly affected, we need to express `cols` in terms of its updated value based on the condition.

If `r` (which is now `data[index]`) is not equal to `c`, then `cols` is set to `r`. Otherwise, `cols` remains unchanged and still contains the value of `c`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is {r, c}, `index` is `index + 4`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration, `cols` is `r` if `r` is not equal to `c` and `cols` remains `c` if `r` is equal to `c`.**
