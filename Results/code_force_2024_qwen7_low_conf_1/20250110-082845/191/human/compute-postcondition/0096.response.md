Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `free_rows` is \( n - \text{len(rows)} \)
   - `free_cols` is \( n - \text{len(cols)} \)
   - `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` and \( m \geq 1 \)
   - `result` is `result * i % MOD`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(1, m + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented from its current value to `i + 1`.
   - Since the loop starts at `i = 1` and increments by 1, the next valid value for `i` would be `i + 1`.

5. **Determine the New Value of `m`:**
   - `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`.
   - These values do not change within the loop body (since they depend on `rows` and `cols`, which are not modified within the loop).

6. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `m` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.

7. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `free_rows` remains the same.
   - `free_cols` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `result` is updated to `result * i % MOD`, where `i` is now `i + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`free_rows` is \( n - \text{len(rows)} \), `free_cols` is \( n - \text{len(cols)} \), `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` and \( m \geq 1 \), `result` is `result * (i + 1) % MOD`**
