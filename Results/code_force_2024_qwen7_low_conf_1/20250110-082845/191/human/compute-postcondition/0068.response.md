Postcondition: ***`k` must be greater than 0; `rows` contains `r` and `c`; `cols` contains either `r` or `c` depending on whether the condition `r != c` holds. The current value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 2`. If `r != c`, the condition `r != c` is satisfied; otherwise, `cols` contains `r`.***
