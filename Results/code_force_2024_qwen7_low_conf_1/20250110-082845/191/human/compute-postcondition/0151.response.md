The code `print(res)` prints the value of `res`. Since `res` is the next element from `results`, and `results` must contain at least one element, `res` will be set to the first element of `results`. However, the actual value of `res` is printed, not updated in the variable itself. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` contains at least one element, `res` is the first element of `results`, and the first element of `results` is printed.**
