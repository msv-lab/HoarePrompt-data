The code adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Given that `c` is `data[1]`, and from the initial state, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, we know that `c` is the same as `data[1]`. Since `rows` was initially a set containing `int(n)`, which is `int(data[0])`, after adding `c`, `rows` will contain both `int(data[0])` and `data[1]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `rows` is a set containing `int(data[0])` and `data[1]`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]`, `r` is `int(data[0])`, `c` is `data[1]`, and `r` is not equal to `c`**
