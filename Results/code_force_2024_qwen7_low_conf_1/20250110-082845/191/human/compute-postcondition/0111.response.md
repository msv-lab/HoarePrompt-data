`cols` is a set that adds the value of `c` to itself. Since `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `index` is increased by 2 from its previous value, `c` is now the integer value of `data[previous_index + 3]`. The states of the other variables (`k`, `rows`, `index`, and `c`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is a positive integer, `rows` contains `r`, `index` is increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `cols` is a set containing the value of `c`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` contains `r`, `index` is increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `cols` is a set containing the value of `c`.**
