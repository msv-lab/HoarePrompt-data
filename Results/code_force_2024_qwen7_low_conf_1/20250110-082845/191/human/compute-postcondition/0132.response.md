`cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` (which is part of the tuple `rows`) to the set `cols`. The initial value of `cols` is a set containing the value of `c`, which is the integer value of `data[index + 7]`. The other variables (`k`, `rows`, `index`, and `c`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is `{r, c}`, `index` is `index + 12`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 7]`, `cols` is a set containing `c` and `r`**
