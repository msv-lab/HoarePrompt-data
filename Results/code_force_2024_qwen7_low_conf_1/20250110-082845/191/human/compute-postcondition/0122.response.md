The code `rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Since `rows` is initially `{r, c}`, adding `c` again does not change the set because sets do not allow duplicate elements. The value of `index` is increased by 4 as per the precondition, and `c` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration. However, since the code only affects `rows`, `index`, and `c`, and the other variables remain unchanged, we update those accordingly.

- `k` is a positive integer (unchanged).
- `rows` is still `{r, c}` (since adding `c` again does not change the set).
- `index` is increased by 4 (so the new value of `index` is `index + 4`).
- `c` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is {r, c}, `index` is increased by 4, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration**
