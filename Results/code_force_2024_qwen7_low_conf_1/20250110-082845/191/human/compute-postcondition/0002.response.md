The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `index`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the state of the list `data` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is 0; no values have been assigned to `n`, `k`, `r_i`, or `c_i`**
