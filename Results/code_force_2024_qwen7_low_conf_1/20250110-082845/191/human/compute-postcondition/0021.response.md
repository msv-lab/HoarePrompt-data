Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)` and `data[1]`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]` and `int(n)`, `r` is `int(n)`, `c` is `data[1]`, and either `r` is not equal to `c` or the initial state is maintained since there is no else part specified in the postcondition.***
