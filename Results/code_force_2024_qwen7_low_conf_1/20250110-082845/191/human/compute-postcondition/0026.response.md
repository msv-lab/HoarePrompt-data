`rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. Given that `r` is equal to `int(data[2])`, and assuming `data[2]` is a specific value (let's denote it as `value_2`), `r` is specifically `int(value_2)`. The set `rows` originally contains `int(n)` and `data[1]`. After adding `r` to `rows`, the set `rows` will now contain `int(n)`, `data[1]`, and `int(value_2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `index` is 4, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)`, `data[1]`, and `int(value_2)`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]` and `int(n)`, `r` is `int(data[2])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[3]`**
