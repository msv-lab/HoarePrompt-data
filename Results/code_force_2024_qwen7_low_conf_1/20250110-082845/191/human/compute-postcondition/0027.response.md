`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. The value of `c` is the integer value of `data[3]`. The set `cols` originally contains `data[1]` and `int(n)`. After adding `c`, `cols` will contain `data[1]`, `int(n)`, and `c`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `index` is 4, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)`, `data[1]`, and `int(value_2)`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]`, `int(n)`, and `c`, `r` is `int(data[2])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[3]`**
