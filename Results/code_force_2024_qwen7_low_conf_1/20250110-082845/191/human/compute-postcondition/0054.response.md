The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`. Since `data[index]` is not specified in the initial state, we will denote its value as `value_of_data_at_index`. Therefore, `n` is assigned this value.

Other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. So, the updated states are:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `n` is now `value_of_data_at_index`
- `k` is 0
- `index` remains the same
- `rows` is a set of all unique pairs (r, c) where r and c are elements of `data` up to the index `index + 2*k`
- `cols` is a set of all unique elements c from the pairs (r, c) where r and c are elements of `data` up to the index `index + 2*k`
- `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`
- `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`
- `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`
- `result` is the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`
- `results` is a list containing the current value of `result`

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is `value_of_data_at_index`, `k` is 0, `index` is the same, `rows` is a set of all unique pairs (r, c) where r and c are elements of `data` up to the index `index + 2*0`, `cols` is a set of all unique elements c from the pairs (r, c) where r and c are elements of `data` up to the index `index + 2*0`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, `result` is the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, `results` is a list containing the current value of `result`**
