The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 1, `n` is not assigned, `k` is not assigned, `r_i` is not assigned, `c_i` is not assigned, `results` is an empty list**
