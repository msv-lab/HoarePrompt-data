The given code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` does not perform any operations that would change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, or `c_i`. Instead, it reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `sys.stdin.read` method. This change does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two rooks attack each other based on the described rules. The variable `input` now refers to `sys.stdin.read`.**
