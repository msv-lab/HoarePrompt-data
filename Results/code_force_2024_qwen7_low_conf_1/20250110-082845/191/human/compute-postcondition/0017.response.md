The code `cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. From the initial state, `c` is equal to `data[1]`. Therefore, the set `cols` now contains `data[1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]`, `r` is `int(n)`, `c` is `data[1]`**
