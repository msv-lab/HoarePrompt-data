`index` is incremented by 2. The values of `k`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is a positive integer, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `index` is increased by 2.
Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `index` is increased by 2**
