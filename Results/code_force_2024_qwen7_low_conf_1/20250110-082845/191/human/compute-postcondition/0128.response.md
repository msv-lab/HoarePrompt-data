`index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was `index + 4`, so now it becomes `(index + 4) + 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is a positive integer, `rows` is {r, c}, `index` is `(index + 4) + 2`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is {r, c}, `index` is `(index + 4) + 2`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
