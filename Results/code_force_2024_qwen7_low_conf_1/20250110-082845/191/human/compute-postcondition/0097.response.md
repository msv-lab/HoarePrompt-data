The code updates the value of `result` by multiplying it with `i + 1` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `result`, `i`, and `MOD`. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `result` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`free_rows` remains the same, `free_cols` remains the same, `m` remains the same, `result` is updated to `result * (i + 1) % MOD`**
