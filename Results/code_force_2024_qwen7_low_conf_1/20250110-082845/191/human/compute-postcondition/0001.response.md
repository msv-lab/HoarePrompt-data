The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input (which is represented by `sys.stdin.read` in the initial state) and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i` are not yet defined, but the `input` operation consumes the input string, leaving `data` as a list of the split strings.

Given the initial state conditions:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
- `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq r_i, c_i \leq n\), and no two rooks attack each other.

After the code runs, the input string is consumed and split into a list, which is stored in `data`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i` are not yet assigned values from this input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; no values have been assigned to `n`, `k`, `r_i`, or `c_i`**
