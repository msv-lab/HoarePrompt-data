The code `free_rows = n - len(rows)` calculates the number of free rows available by subtracting the length of the set `rows` from the value of `n`. The value of `n` is originally the value of `val`, and `rows` contains unique row indices encountered during loop iterations.

Let's denote the length of the set `rows` as `len_rows`.

- `free_rows` is updated to `n - len_rows`, which is `val - len_rows`.
- The values of `k`, `index`, `cols`, `result`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices `r` and column indices `c` encountered during the loop iterations where `r` and `c` are integers from the input data, `index` is the final value of `index` after the loop completes (which is `val + 2 * k`), `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices `c` and row indices `r` encountered during the loop iterations where `r` and `c` are integers from the input data, `result` is the final value of the result calculated as `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD` where `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` at the start of the loop, `results` is a list containing all previous values of `result`, `n` is the original value of `val`, and `free_rows` is updated to `val - len_rows`.**
