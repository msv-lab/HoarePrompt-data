`free_rows` is assigned the value `n - len(rows)`. The value of `n` is unchanged, and `len(rows)` is the length of the set `rows`. The value of `rows` is still the set containing all unique values of `r` and `c` where `r = data[index + 2*i]` and `c = data[index + 2*i + 1]` for `i` in `range(k)`. The values of `k`, `index`, `rows`, and `cols` are unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` is 0, `index` is `index + 2*k`, `rows` is a set containing all unique values of `r` and `c` where `r = data[index + 2*i]` and `c = data[index + 2*i + 1]` for `i` in `range(k)`, `cols` is a set containing all unique values of `r` and `c` where `r = data[index + 2*i]` and `c = data[index + 2*i + 1]` for `i` in `range(k)`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`**
