The function `func_1` does not directly accept any parameters from the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, it seems the function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes parameters `n`, `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i`.

For each test case, the function accepts:
- `n`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k`: A positive integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
- `r_i` and `c_i`: Integers such that \(1 \leq r_i, c_i \leq n\), and no two rooks attack each other.

Given the nature of the problem (placement of rooks on a board without attacking each other), the function likely returns a result based on the test case inputs, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided snippet.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing parameters `n`, `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i`. It returns a result based on these inputs, but the exact output is not specified.**
