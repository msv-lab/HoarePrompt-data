The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The initial values of the variables are as follows:
- `free_rows` is `val - len(rows)`
- `free_cols` is `val - len(cols)`
- `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`
- `result` is `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD`
- `results` is a list containing `[result]` and a new result appended to it
- `n` is `val`
- `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`

After executing `index += 2`, the value of `index` is updated, but no other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`free_rows` is `val - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `val - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, `result` is `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing `[result]` and a new result appended to it, `n` is `val`, `index` is `index + 2`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`**
