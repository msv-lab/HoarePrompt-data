According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
- `k` must be greater than 1.
- `rows` contains `data[index - 5]`.
- `cols` contains `r` and `r`.
- `index` is `index + 4`.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`.
- `c` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0 (since the loop runs from 0 to `k-1`). Given that `k` must initially be greater than 1, after one iteration, `k` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Since `k` must be greater than 0, it means `k` could be 1 or any positive integer. However, since we are only checking if the loop can execute again, we focus on the condition that `k` must be greater than 0.

Additionally, the values of `rows`, `cols`, `index`, `r`, and `c` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no changes are mentioned.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `rows` contains `data[index - 5]`; `cols` contains `r` and `r`; `index` is `index + 4`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]`.**
