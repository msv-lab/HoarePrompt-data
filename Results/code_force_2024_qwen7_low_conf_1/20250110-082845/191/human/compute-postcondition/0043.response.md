The code `m = min(free_rows, free_cols)` assigns the minimum value between `free_rows` and `free_cols` to `m`. The values of `free_rows` and `free_cols` are derived from the initial state.

From the initial state:
- `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`
- `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`

Since the code does not change the values of `n`, `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `index`, or `data`, these variables remain unchanged. The variable `m` is newly introduced and assigned the minimum value between `free_rows` and `free_cols`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` is 0, `index` is `index + 2*k`, `rows` is a set containing all unique values of `r` and `c` where `r = data[index + 2*i]` and `c = data[index + 2*i + 1]` for `i` in `range(k)`, `cols` is a set containing all unique values of `r` and `c` where `r = data[index + 2*i]` and `c = data[index + 2*i + 1]` for `i` in `range(k)`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`**.
