The code snippet appends the current value of `result` to the list `results`. This does not change the value of `result` itself but adds it to the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices `r` and column indices `c` encountered during the loop iterations, `index` is the final value of `index` after the loop completes (`val + 2 * k`), `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices `c` and row indices `r` encountered during the loop iterations, `result` is the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, `results` is a list containing all previous values of `result` appended with the current `result`, `n` is the original value of `val`, `free_rows` is `val - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `val - len(rows)` and `n - len(cols)`**.
