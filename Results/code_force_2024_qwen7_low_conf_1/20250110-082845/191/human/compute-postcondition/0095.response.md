`result` is updated by multiplying it with `i` and taking modulo `MOD`. The value of `free_rows`, `free_cols`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The initial state provides that `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` and \( m \geq 1 \). Therefore, after the code is executed, the value of `result` is updated.

Output State: **`free_rows` is \( n - \text{len(rows)} \); `free_cols` is \( n - \text{len(cols)} \); `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` and \( m \geq 1 \); `result` is `result * i % MOD`**
