Postcondition: ***`k` must be greater than 1; `rows` contains `data[index - 5]`; `cols` contains `r` and `r`; `index` is `index + 4`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then `cols` contains `data[index - 5]` twice.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else branches of the if statement. If the condition `r != c` is true, `cols` will contain `data[index - 5]` twice. If the condition is false, the original state of `cols` remains unchanged as specified in the else part (which is essentially no change since there is no else part).
