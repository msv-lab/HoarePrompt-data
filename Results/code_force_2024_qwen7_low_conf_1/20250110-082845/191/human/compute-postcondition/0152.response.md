According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least one element, `res` is the first element of `results`, and the first element of `results` is printed.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, `res` will be set to the second element of `results` if it exists. Therefore, `results` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`results` contains at least one element, `res` is the second element of `results` if it exists**
