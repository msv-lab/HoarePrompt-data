Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `index` is 4, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)`, `data[1]`, `int(value_2)`, and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]`, `int(n)`, `c`, and `int(data[2])`, `r` is `int(data[2])`. This is true regardless of whether `r` is equal to `c` or not since there is no else part and the if part modifies the sets `rows` and `cols` accordingly.***
