Postcondition: ***`k` is a positive integer, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `index` has been increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `cols` is a set containing the values `c` and `r`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then `r` and `c` are both included in `cols`. If `r` equals `c`, then no change occurs in `cols`.***
