The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. According to the initial state, `index` is initially `index + 4`. After executing the code, the new value of `index` will be `(index + 4) + 2`, which simplifies to `index + 6`.

The states of the other variables (`k`, `rows`, `cols`, `r`, and `c`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `rows` contains `data[index - 5]`; `cols` contains `r` and `r`; `index` is `index + 6`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.**
