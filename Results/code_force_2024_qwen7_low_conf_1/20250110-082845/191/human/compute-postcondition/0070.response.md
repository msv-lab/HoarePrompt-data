`r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 2`. Since `r != c` is true, `cols` will now contain `r`.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `rows` contains `r` and `c`; `cols` contains `r`; `index` is `index + 2`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.**
