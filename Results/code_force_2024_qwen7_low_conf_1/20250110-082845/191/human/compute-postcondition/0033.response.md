The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `c` by converting `data[index + 1]` to an integer. Given the initial state, `index` is 4. Therefore, `c` will be assigned the value of `data[5]`.

Here are the steps:
1. The value of `index` is 4.
2. `c` is updated to `int(data[index + 1])`, which is `int(data[4 + 1])` or `int(data[5])`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` is `k - 1`, `index` is 4, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)`, `data[1]`, `int(value_2)`, and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]`, `int(n)`, `c`, and `int(data[2])`, `r` is `int(data[4])`, `c` is `int(data[5])`**
