The code `cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Initially, `cols` contains the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, which is `c`. After executing this line, `cols` will contain `c` again, but since sets do not allow duplicate elements, the set `cols` remains unchanged.

The values of other variables remain the same as per the initial state. So, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `rows` contains `r` and `c`; `cols` contains `r`; `index` is `index + 4`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]`.**
