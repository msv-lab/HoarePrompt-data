Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `free_rows = val - len(rows)`
- `free_cols = val - len(cols)`
- `m = min(free_rows, free_cols)`
- `result = (1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD`
- `results` is a list containing `[result]` and a new result appended to it
- `n = val`
- `index = index + 2`
- `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`
- `rows` is an empty set
- `cols` is an empty set

### Loop:
```
for _ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop runs for `k` iterations, where `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be a positive integer.

2. **Adjusting the states:**
   - Since `k` is derived from `data[index + 1]`, we need to ensure that `k` is a positive integer. This means `data[index + 1]` should be a valid integer and it should be greater than 0.
   - The value of `index` is already incremented by 2 (`index = index + 2`), so no further adjustment is needed for `index`.
   - The values of `free_rows`, `free_cols`, `m`, `result`, `results`, `n`, `rows`, and `cols` do not directly affect the loop's ability to run as they are only used within the loop body.

### Final State Adjustment:
To ensure the loop can execute, the key state to adjust is `k` being a positive integer.

### Final Answer:
State: **`k` must be a positive integer**
