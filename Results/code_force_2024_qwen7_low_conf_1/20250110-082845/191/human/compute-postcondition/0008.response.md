The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `k`. Since `n` is equal to `data[index]`, `k` will be assigned the value of `data[index + 1]`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is equal to `data[index]`; `k` is equal to `data[index + 1]`**
