To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `rows` contains `r` and `c`.
- `index` has been increased by 2.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `cols` is a set containing the values `c` and `r`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then both `r` and `c` are included in `cols`. If `r` equals `c`, then no change occurs in `cols`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for _ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `k` is a positive integer (unchanged).
   - `rows` contains `r` and `c`.
   - `index` has been increased by 2.
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
   - `cols` is a set containing the values `c` and `r`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then both `r` and `c` are included in `cols`. If `r` equals `c`, then no change occurs in `cols`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `k` times.
   - For each iteration, the value of `c` changes based on the value of `data[index + 1]`, where `index` is increased by 2 for each iteration.
   - After each iteration, `cols` is updated based on the current values of `r` and `c`.

3. **State Adjustments for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `k` is a positive integer, it remains unchanged.
   - `rows` contains `r` and `c` from the previous iteration.
   - `index` is increased by 2 for each iteration, so for the next iteration, `index` will be increased by 2 from its current value.
   - `c` will be the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration.
   - `cols` will be updated based on the new values of `r` and `c`.

For the next iteration of the loop:
- `index` will be increased by 2 from its current value.
- `c` will be the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration.
- `cols` will be updated based on the new values of `r` and `c`.

State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `index` is increased by 2 from its current value, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration, and `cols` is a set containing the values `c` and `r`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then both `r` and `c` are included in `cols`. If `r` equals `c`, then no change occurs in `cols`.**
