Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `index` is `index`, `rows` is a set of all unique pairs (r, c) where r and c are elements of `data` up to the index `index + 2*k`, `cols` is a set of all unique elements c from the pairs (r, c) where r and c are elements of `data` up to the index `index + 2*k`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, `result` is the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`.**
