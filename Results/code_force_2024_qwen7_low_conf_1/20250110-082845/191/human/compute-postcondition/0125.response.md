Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( k \) is a positive integer.
- \( \text{rows} \) is a set containing two elements \( r \) and \( c \).
- \( \text{index} \) has been increased by 4 from its previous value.
- \( c \) is the integer value of \( \text{data}[\text{index} + 1] \) for the next iteration.
- \( \text{cols} \) contains the value \( r \) if \( r \neq c \). If \( r = c \), \( \text{cols} \) remains unchanged and includes the value of \( c \).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
The loop runs \( k \) times. Each iteration of the loop updates the values of the relevant variables based on the conditions given.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States:

1. **Incrementing the Index**: The index is increased by 4 from its previous value.
   - Therefore, the new value of `index` is \( \text{index} + 4 \).

2. **Determining the New Value of \( c \)**: 
   - \( c \) is updated to be the integer value of \( \text{data}[\text{index} + 1] \).
   - Thus, the new value of \( c \) is \( \text{data}[\text{index} + 1] \).

3. **Updating \( \text{rows} \) and \( \text{cols} \)**:
   - If \( r \neq c \), then \( \text{rows} \) becomes \( \{r, c\} \).
   - If \( r = c \), then \( \text{cols} \) remains unchanged and still includes the value of \( c \).

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- The loop will run one more time, so we need to adjust the state according to the above analysis.

- The new value of \( \text{index} \) is \( \text{index} + 4 \).
- The new value of \( c \) is \( \text{data}[\text{index} + 1] \).
- \( \text{rows} \) remains as \( \{r, c\} \) unless \( r \neq c \).
- \( \text{cols} \) remains unchanged if \( r = c \); otherwise, it updates to include \( c \).

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is {r, c}, `index` is `index + 4`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration, `cols` contains the value `r` if `r` is not equal to `c`. If `r` equals `c`, `cols` remains unchanged and includes the value of `c`.**
