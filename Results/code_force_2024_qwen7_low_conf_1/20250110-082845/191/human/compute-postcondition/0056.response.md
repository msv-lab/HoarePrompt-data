The value of `index` is incremented by 2. This directly changes the value of `index`. All other variables remain in their previous states since the code does not affect them directly. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is `value_of_data_at_index`, `k` is `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `index + 2`, `rows` is a set of all unique pairs (r, c) where r and c are elements of `data` up to the index `index + 2*0`, `cols` is a set of all unique elements c from the pairs (r, c) where r and c are elements of `data` up to the index `index + 2*0`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, `result` is the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, `results` is a list containing the current value of `result`**
