`index` is incremented by 2. The original value of `index` was 4, so the new value of `index` is 4 + 2 = 6. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` is `k - 1`, `index` is 6, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)`, `data[1]`, `int(value_2)`, and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]`, `int(n)`, `c`, and `int(data[2])`, `r` is `int(data[4])`, `c` is `int(data[5])`**
