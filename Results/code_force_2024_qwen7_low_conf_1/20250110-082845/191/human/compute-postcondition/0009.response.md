The code increments the value of `index` by 2. The previous value of `index` was such that `n` was assigned `data[index]` and `k` was assigned `data[index + 1]`. After executing `index += 2`, the new value of `index` will be the original value of `index` plus 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is equal to `data[index]`; `k` is equal to `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2**
