The code `cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` (from the initial state) to the set `cols`. Other variables remain unchanged.

- `k` is a positive integer.
- `rows` is still `{r, c}`.
- `index` is increased by 4.
- `c` remains the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is {r, c}, `index` is increased by 4, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration, `cols` contains the value `r`**
