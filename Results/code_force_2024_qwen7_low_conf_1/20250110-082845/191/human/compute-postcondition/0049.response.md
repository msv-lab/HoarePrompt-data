Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `index` is `index`.
   - `rows` is an empty set.
   - `cols` is an empty set.
   - `free_rows` is `n`.
   - `free_cols` is `n`.
   - `m` is `n`.
   - `result` is `2 % MOD`.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `1` to `m + 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration Check**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m + 1`.
   - Given `m = n` and `i = 2`, the condition for the next iteration is `i < n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` needs to be increased by 1 for the next iteration, `i` will become 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is still dependent on `m` being `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain unchanged.
   - All other states (`t`, `k`, `index`, `rows`, `cols`, `free_rows`, `free_cols`, `result`) remain the same as they are not affected by the loop itself.

6. **Final States**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `index` is `index`.
   - `rows` is an empty set.
   - `cols` is an empty set.
   - `free_rows` is `n`.
   - `free_cols` is `n`.
   - `m` is `n`.
   - `result` is `2 % MOD`.
   - `i` is 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `k` is 0, `index` is `index`, `rows` is an empty set, `cols` is an empty set, `free_rows` is `n`, `free_cols` is `n`, `m` is `n`, `result` is `2 % MOD`, `i` is 3**
