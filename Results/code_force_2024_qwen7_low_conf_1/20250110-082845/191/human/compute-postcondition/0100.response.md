Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`
   - `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`
   - `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, and `m` is at least 1.
   - `result` is `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD`
   - `results` is a list containing `[result]`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates `t` times.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it will modify the states of `free_rows`, `free_cols`, `m`, `result`, and `results`.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - After each iteration of the loop, `free_rows`, `free_cols`, and `m` will be recalculated based on the current values of `rows` and `cols`.
   - `result` will be updated based on the new value of `m`.
   - `results` will be appended with the new `result`.

5. **Final State Calculation:**
   - Since the loop is iterating `t` times, after the first iteration, the states will change as follows:
     - `free_rows` and `free_cols` will be recalculated based on the new values of `rows` and `cols`.
     - `m` will be the minimum of the new `free_rows` and `free_cols`.
     - `result` will be updated to `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD`.
     - `results` will contain the new result.

Given the above analysis, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `free_rows` and `free_cols` will be recalculated based on the new values of `rows` and `cols`.
- `m` will be the minimum of the new `free_rows` and `free_cols`.
- `result` will be updated to `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD`.
- `results` will contain the new result.

Since the exact values of `rows` and `cols` are not provided, we can only express the states in terms of the new values:

**State: **`free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` and `m` is at least 1, `result` is `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing `[result]` and a new result appended to it.**
