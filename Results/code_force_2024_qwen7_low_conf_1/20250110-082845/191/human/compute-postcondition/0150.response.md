According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop will execute as long as `results` contains at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `results` must contain at least one element.
- `res` is printed, meaning that `res` is the current element from `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element. Since `res` was just printed, it means that `results` had at least one element to begin with, but one element has now been consumed by the loop.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `results` must contain at least one element (since one element has already been processed).
- `res` will be the next element from `results`.

State: **`results` must contain at least one element, `res` will be the next element from `results`**
