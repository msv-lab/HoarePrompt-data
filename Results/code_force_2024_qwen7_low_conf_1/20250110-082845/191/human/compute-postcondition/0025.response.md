The value of `index` is incremented by 2, changing it from its initial value of 2 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `index` is 4, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)` and `data[1]`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]` and `int(n)`, `r` is `int(data[2])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[3]`**
