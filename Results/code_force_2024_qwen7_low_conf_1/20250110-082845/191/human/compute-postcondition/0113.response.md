The code `rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Given the initial state, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `r` is not equal to `c`. Since `rows` initially contains `r`, adding `c` to the set `rows` will include both `r` and `c` in the set.

Therefore, the updated state of `rows` will contain both `r` and `c`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `index` has been increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `cols` is a set containing the value of `c`, and `r` is not equal to `c`**
