The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The previous value of `index` was increased by 2, but the specific value of `index` before this operation is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the increment of `index`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `index` is increased by 4 (previous increase by 2 plus current increase by 2), `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration, `cols` is a set containing the values `c` and `r` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise `cols` remains unchanged.**
