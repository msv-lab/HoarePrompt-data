The code adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Let's go through the changes step by step:

1. Initially, `rows` contains `data[index - 5]` and `r`.
2. The code `rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`.

Since sets do not allow duplicate values, the set `rows` will now contain the unique elements from its previous contents and the new value `c`. 

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `k` is still greater than 0.
- `rows` now contains `data[index - 5]`, `r`, and `c`.
- `cols` remains unchanged, containing `r`, `r`, and `c`.
- `index` is updated to `index + 6`.
- `r` is still the integer value of `data[index - 2]`.
- `c` is still the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `rows` contains `data[index - 5]`, `r`, and `c`; `cols` contains `r`, `r`, and `c`; `index` is `index + 6`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
