`rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. The value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 7]`. The initial state shows that `index` is `index + 6`, so after this operation, `index` will be `index + 12`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is `{r, c}`, `index` is `index + 12`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 7]`, `cols` is a set containing `c`**
