Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices `r` and column indices `c` encountered during the loop iterations where `r` and `c` are integers from the input data, `index` is the final value of `index` after the loop completes (which is `val + 2 * k`), `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices `c` and row indices `r` encountered during the loop iterations where `r` and `c` are integers from the input data, `result` is the final value of the result calculated as `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD` where `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` at the start of the loop, `results` is a list containing all previous values of `result`, and `n` is the original value of `val`.**
