The code snippet sets `cols` to an empty set, which means the set `cols` now contains no elements. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is `value_of_data_at_index`, `k` is `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `index + 2`, `rows` is an empty set, `cols` is an empty set, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, `result` is the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, `results` is a list containing the current value of `result`.**
