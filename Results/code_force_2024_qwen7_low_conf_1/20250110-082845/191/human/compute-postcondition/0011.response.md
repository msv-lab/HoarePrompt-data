The code initializes the `cols` variable as an empty set. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is equal to `data[index]`; `k` is equal to `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `rows` is an empty set; `cols` is an empty set**
