`c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. Given that `index` is 2, `data[index + 1]` is `data[3]`. The previous value of `c` was `data[1]`. Therefore, `c` is updated to be the integer value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `index` is 2, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)` and `data[1]`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]` and `int(n)`, `r` is `int(data[2])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[3]`**
