The code initializes the variable `result` to 1. This assignment does not affect the values of `free_rows`, `free_cols`, or `m`. Therefore, the only change is the new value of `result`.

Output State: **`free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum value between `free_rows` and `free_cols`, `result` is 1**
