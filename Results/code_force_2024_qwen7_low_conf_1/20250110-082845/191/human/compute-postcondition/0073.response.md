`rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. The initial state tells us that `rows` contains `r` and `c`. After adding `r` to the set, `r` will already be in the set, so adding it again does not change the set. The value of `r` remains the same as its current value, which is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`.

The values of `k`, `cols`, `index`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `rows` contains `r` and `c`; `cols` contains `r`; `index` is `index + 4`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]`.**
