`index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 1, `n` is not assigned, `k` is not assigned, `r_i` is not assigned, `c_i` is not assigned.
