The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The initial values of `k`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` must be greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2.
Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2**
