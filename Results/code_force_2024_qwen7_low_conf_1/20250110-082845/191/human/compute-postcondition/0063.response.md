`rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. The value of `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`. The value of `index` is increased by 2, so `index` is now `index + 2`. The states of the other variables (`k`, `c`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `rows` contains `r`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 2`**
