The code `rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Based on the initial state, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`. Since `index` was previously updated by `index = index + 4`, `c` is now the integer value of `data[index - 5]`.

After executing the code, the set `rows` will contain the value of `c`, which is `data[index - 5]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `rows` contains `data[index - 5]`; `cols` contains `r`; `index` is `index + 4`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]`.**
