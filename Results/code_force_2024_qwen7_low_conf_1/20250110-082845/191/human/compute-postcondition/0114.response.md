The code `cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Since `cols` is initially a set containing the value of `c`, and `r` is not equal to `c`, adding `r` to `cols` will result in `cols` now containing both `c` and `r`.

All other variables remain unchanged: `k` is a positive integer, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `index` has been increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `r` is not equal to `c`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `index` has been increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `cols` is a set containing the values `c` and `r`, and `r` is not equal to `c`.**
