The code `rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. The initial state shows that `rows` is a set containing `int(n)`, `data[1]`, and `int(value_2)`. Since `c` is added to this set, the updated set will include `int(n)`, `data[1]`, `int(value_2)`, and `c`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `index` is 4, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)`, `data[1]`, `int(value_2)`, and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]`, `int(n)`, and `c`, `r` is `int(data[2])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[3]`**
