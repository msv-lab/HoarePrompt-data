The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The initial state shows that `index` was previously updated by adding 2 (`index = index + 2`). Now, the value of `index` is further incremented by 2. The states of the other variables (`k`, `rows`, `cols`, `r`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `rows` contains `r` and `c`; `cols` contains `r`; `index` is `index + 4`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]`.**
