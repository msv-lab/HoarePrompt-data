`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. From the initial state, we know that `c` is the integer value of `data[(index + 6) + 1]`, which simplifies to `data[index + 7]`. The value of `cols` is a set, and adding an element to a set does not change the fact that it is a set, but it now contains the new element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is `{r}`, `index` is `index + 6`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 7]`, `cols` is a set containing `c`**
