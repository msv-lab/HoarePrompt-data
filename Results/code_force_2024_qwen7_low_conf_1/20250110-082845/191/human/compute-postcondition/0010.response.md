The code initializes an empty set named `rows`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `index`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `rows` set.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is equal to `data[index]`; `k` is equal to `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `rows` is an empty set**
