`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the `cols` list. Given the initial state, we know that `cols` initially contains `r` and `r`. After adding `c` to `cols`, the updated list will contain `r`, `r`, and `c`.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `index` is incremented by 6: `index` is now `index + 6`.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `cols` now contains `r`, `r`, and `c`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0; `rows` contains `data[index - 5]` and `r`; `cols` contains `r`, `r`, and `c`; `index` is `index + 6`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `rows` contains `data[index - 5]` and `r`; `cols` contains `r`, `r`, and `c`; `index` is `index + 6`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
