`rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Since `rows` initially contains `r`, after adding `c`, `rows` will contain both `r` and `c`. The value of `c` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `index` is updated to `index + 2`. The precondition that `r != c` remains valid.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `rows` contains `r` and `c`; the current value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 2`. The current state satisfies the condition `r != c`.**
