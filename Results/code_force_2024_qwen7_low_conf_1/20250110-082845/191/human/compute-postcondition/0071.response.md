`c` is assigned the value of `data[index + 1]` converted to an integer. The value of `data[index + 1]` is unknown, but it will be an integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `rows` contains `r` and `c`; `cols` contains `r`; `index` is `index + 2`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is an integer value of `data[index + 1]`.**
