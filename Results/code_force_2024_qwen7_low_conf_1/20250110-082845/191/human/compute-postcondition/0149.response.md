The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of the variable `res`. It does not modify the value of `res` or any other variable. The initial state is that `results` must contain at least one element, but the code only references `res`, which is not mentioned in the initial state. Since no changes are made to any variable, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `res` is printed.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least one element, `res` is printed**
