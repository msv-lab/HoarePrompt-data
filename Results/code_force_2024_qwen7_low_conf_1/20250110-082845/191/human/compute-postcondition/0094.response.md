Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `free_rows` is \( n - \text{len(rows)} \) and \( n - \text{len(rows)} \geq 1 \).
   - `free_cols` is \( n - \text{len(cols)} \) and \( n - \text{len(cols)} \geq 1 \).
   - `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` and \( m \geq 1 \).
   - `result` is `result * i % MOD`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, m + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`.
   - After each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < m + 1`.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `m` (since the loop starts from 1 and ends at `m`).
   - Since `i` reaches `m` at the end of the current iteration, the loop will stop executing in the next iteration.

5. **New State:**
   - `free_rows` remains the same: \( n - \text{len(rows)} \) and \( n - \text{len(rows)} \geq 1 \).
   - `free_cols` remains the same: \( n - \text{len(cols)} \) and \( n - \text{len(cols)} \geq 1 \).
   - `m` remains the same: the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` and \( m \geq 1 \).
   - `result` is updated by multiplying it with `i % MOD`, so after the last iteration, `result` will be `result * m % MOD`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`free_rows` is \( n - \text{len(rows)} \) where \( n - \text{len(rows)} \geq 1 \), `free_cols` is \( n - \text{len(cols)} \) where \( n - \text{len(cols)} \geq 1 \), `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` and \( m \geq 1 \), `result` is `result * m % MOD`**
