Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0; `rows` contains `data[index - 5]`, `r`, and `c`; `cols` contains `r`, and `r`; `index` is `index + 6`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then `cols` contains three occurrences of `r`. Otherwise, the values of `rows` and `cols` remain unchanged.***
