`cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `cols` now includes `r`, and the conditions for `k`, `rows`, `c`, `index`, and the condition `r != c` remain valid.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `rows` contains `r` and `c`; `cols` contains `r`; the current value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 2`. The current state satisfies the condition `r != c`.**
