`rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. The value of `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`. After adding `r` to `rows`, the value of `k` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, and the value of `c` (the integer value of `data[index + 1]`) is not directly affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` contains `r`, `index` is increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
