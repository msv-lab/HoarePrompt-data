The code `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. Since `rows` is initially a set containing `{r, c}`, adding `r` to it will not change the set because `r` is already in the set. The value of `c` remains unchanged. The value of `index` is updated to `(index + 4) + 2`, which simplifies to `index + 6`. The value of `c` is still the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, but since `index` has changed, the exact value of `c` is now the integer value of `data[(index + 6) + 1]`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is `{r}`, `index` is `index + 6`, `c` is the integer value of `data[(index + 6) + 1]`**
