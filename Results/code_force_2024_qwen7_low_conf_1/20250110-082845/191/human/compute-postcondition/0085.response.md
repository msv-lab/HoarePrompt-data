`cols` is a set containing `r`, `r`, and `c`. The code adds `r` to the set `cols`. Since sets do not allow duplicate values, the second `r` will be ignored. The value of `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, and the value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `rows` contains `data[index - 5]`, `r`, and `c`; `cols` contains `r`, `c`, and `r` (which is equivalent to just `r` since sets do not contain duplicates); `index` is `index + 6`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
