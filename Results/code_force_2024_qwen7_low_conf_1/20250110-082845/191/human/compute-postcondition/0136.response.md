The code updates the variable `free_cols` by subtracting the length of the set `cols` from `n`. The length of `cols` is the number of unique column indices encountered during the loop iterations.

Let's denote the length of `cols` as `len(cols)`. The updated value of `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`.

Since the other variables are not affected by this line of code, they retain their initial states.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices `r` and column indices `c` encountered during the loop iterations, `index` is the final value of `index` after the loop completes (`val + 2 * k`), `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices `c` and row indices `r` encountered during the loop iterations, `result` is the final value of the result calculated as `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD` where `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` at the start of the loop, `results` is a list containing all previous values of `result`, `n` is the original value of `val`, `free_rows` is updated to `val - len_rows`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`**.
