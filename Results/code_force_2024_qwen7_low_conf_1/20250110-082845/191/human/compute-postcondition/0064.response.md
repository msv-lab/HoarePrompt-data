`cols` is a set that adds the value of `c` to itself. Since sets do not allow duplicate values, `cols` will now contain `c`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` must be greater than 0; `rows` contains `r`; `cols` contains `c`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 2`.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `rows` contains `r`; `cols` contains `c`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 2`.**
