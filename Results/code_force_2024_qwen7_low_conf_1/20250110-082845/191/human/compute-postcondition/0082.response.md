The code `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the list `rows`. Based on the initial state, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`. Since `rows` was initially `data[index - 5]`, after adding `r`, `rows` will contain the original elements plus `r`.

So, updating the variables:
- `k` remains greater than 0.
- `rows` now contains `data[index - 5]` and `r`.
- `cols` contains `r` and `r` (no change).
- `index` is now `index + 6`.
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[index - 2]`.
- `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `rows` contains `data[index - 5]` and `r`; `cols` contains `r` and `r`; `index` is `index + 6`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.**
