`results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD`, which is already defined in the initial state. The variables `free_rows`, `free_cols`, `m`, and `result` themselves do not change as a result of this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the addition of `result` to the `results` list.

Output State: **`free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols` and `m` is at least 1, `result` is `(1 * 2 * ... * m) % MOD`, `results` is a list containing `[result]`**
