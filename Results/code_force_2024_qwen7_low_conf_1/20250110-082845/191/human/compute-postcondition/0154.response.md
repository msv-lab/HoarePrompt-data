Output State: **`results` is a list containing the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD` for each iteration, where `m` is the minimum of `n - len(rows)` and `n - len(cols)` for each iteration, `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices `r` and column indices `c` encountered during all loop iterations, `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices `c` and row indices `r` encountered during all loop iterations, `index` is the final value of `index` after all iterations (`val + 2 * t`), `k` is the total number of pairs processed during all iterations, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`, and the loop executes at least `len(results)` times.**
