The code assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `c`. The value of `data[index + 1]` is not specified in the initial state, so we will denote it as `value`. The initial conditions state that `k` must be greater than 0 and `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.

After executing the code, `c` will hold the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
