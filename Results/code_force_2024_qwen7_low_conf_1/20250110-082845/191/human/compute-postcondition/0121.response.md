The code snippet adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. The initial state is given as follows:
- `k` is a positive integer
- `rows` is a set containing `{r, c}`
- `index` is increased by 4
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration
- `cols` is a set containing the values `c` and `r` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise `cols` remains unchanged.

After executing the line `cols.add(c)`:
- `cols` will include the value of `c`
- If `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` will contain `{r, c}`; otherwise, `cols` will remain unchanged

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `rows` is {r, c}, `index` is increased by 4, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` for the next iteration, `cols` contains {r, c} if r is not equal to c, otherwise `cols` remains unchanged and includes the value of `c`**
