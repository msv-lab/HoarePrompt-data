Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is equal to `data[0]`, `k` is `k - 1`, `index` is 6, `rows` is a set containing `int(n)`, `data[1]`, `int(value_2)`, `int(data[4])`, and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `data[1]`, `int(n)`, `int(data[2])`, `int(data[4])`, and `int(data[5])`, `r` is `int(data[4])`, `c` is `int(data[5])`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then the values of `rows` and `cols` remain unchanged.**
