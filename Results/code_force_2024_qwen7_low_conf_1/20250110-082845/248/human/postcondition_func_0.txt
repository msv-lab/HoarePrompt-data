The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `p`, where `a` is a positive integer and `p` is the prime number 999,999,893. It returns the modular inverse of `a` modulo 999,999,893, which is calculated as \(a^{999999893-2} \mod 999999893\). This calculation is performed using the built-in `pow` function in Python, which efficiently computes the modular exponentiation. The function handles the case where `a` and `p` are coprime, as required for the modular inverse to exist. If `a` and `p` are not coprime, the function will still execute but will return an incorrect result because the modular inverse does not exist in such cases. There are no explicit checks for this condition within the function.
