#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the numerator (p) of the irreducible fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) to find its modular inverse modulo \(999\,999\,893\); p is the prime number \(999\,999\,893\).
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the modular inverse of 'a' modulo 999999893, which is calculated as \(a^{999999893-2} \mod 999999893\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `p`, where `a` is a positive integer and `p` is the prime number 999,999,893. It returns the modular inverse of `a` modulo 999,999,893, which is calculated as \(a^{999999893-2} \mod 999999893\). This calculation is performed using the built-in `pow` function in Python, which efficiently computes the modular exponentiation. The function handles the case where `a` and `p` are coprime, as required for the modular inverse to exist. If `a` and `p` are not coprime, the function will still execute but will return an incorrect result because the modular inverse does not exist in such cases. There are no explicit checks for this condition within the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_2(N):
    if (N == 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        if (N == 2) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            return 714285638
            #The program returns 714285638
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `N` and returns one of three possible values based on the value of `N`. Specifically, it returns 0 if `N` is 1, 1 if `N` is 2, and 714285638 for any other value of `N`. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond checking the value of `N` and returning the appropriate result. The function does not modify any external state and solely relies on the input `N` to determine its output.
