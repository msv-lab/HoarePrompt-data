Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `N` and returns one of three possible values based on the value of `N`. Specifically, it returns 0 if `N` is 1, 1 if `N` is 2, and 714285638 for any other value of `N`. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond checking the value of `N` and returning the appropriate result. The function does not modify any external state and solely relies on the input `N` to determine its output.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `N` is 1, the function returns 0.
- If `N` is 2, the function returns 1.
- For any other value of `N`, the function returns 714285638.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle non-integer inputs. If a non-integer value is passed as `N`, the behavior is undefined and could lead to unexpected results or errors. However, since the problem statement only focuses on the functionality based on the given code, this is noted as a potential issue but not included in the primary functionality description.
