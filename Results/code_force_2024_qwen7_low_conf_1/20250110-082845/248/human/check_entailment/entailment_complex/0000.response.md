Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating \(\frac{M}{V}\) after performing folding operations on a square piece of paper \(N\) times. The result should be in the form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\), where \(B\) is reduced to an irreducible fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot \text{inv}(q) \mod 999,999,893\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, p)`**: This function calculates the modular inverse of `a` modulo \(999,999,893\) using Fermat's Little Theorem, which is valid since \(999,999,893\) is a prime number. The implementation is correct.
   - **`func_2(N)`**: This function returns specific values based on the value of \(N\):
     - If \(N = 1\), it returns \(0\).
     - If \(N = 2\), it returns \(1\).
     - For \(N > 2\), it returns \(714285638\).
   - However, the function does not match the expected behavior for the problem. Based on the problem description, the value of \(\frac{M}{V}\) should be \(0\) for \(N = 1\), \(\sqrt{2} - 1\) for \(N = 2\), and \(1 + \sqrt{2}\) for \(N = 3\), etc. The function `func_2` does not reflect these calculations correctly.

3. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - Given the analysis, `func_2` does not accurately calculate the required value of \(\frac{M}{V}\) based on \(N\). Therefore, the program as a whole cannot be considered correct because it does not solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
