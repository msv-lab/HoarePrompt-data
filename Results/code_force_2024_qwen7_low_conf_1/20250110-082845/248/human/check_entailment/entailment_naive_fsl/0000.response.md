Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform the necessary calculations for the given problem.

- `func_1` calculates the modular inverse, but it is not used anywhere in the program.
- `func_2` attempts to return a hardcoded value based on the number of operations `N`, which does not reflect the actual calculation of \(\frac{M}{V}\).

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to compute the values of \(M\) and \(V\) based on the number of operations \(N\). The ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) for the given operations can be derived mathematically, and the program should output the result in the form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\), where \(B\) is represented as an irreducible fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and the final output is \(p \times \text{inv}(q) \mod 999999893\).

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem description.
