You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a square piece of paper with a side length equal to 1 unit. In one
operation, you fold each corner of the square to the center of the paper, thus
forming another square with a side length equal to \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} units.
By taking this square as a new square, you do the operation again and repeat
this process a total of N times.

Performing operations for N = 2 .

After performing the set of operations, you open the paper with the same side
up you started with and see some crease lines on it. Every crease line is one
of two types: a mountain or a valley. A mountain is when the paper folds
outward, and a valley is when the paper folds inward.

You calculate the sum of the length of all mountain crease lines on the paper
and call it M . Similarly, you calculate for valley crease lines and call it V
. You want to find the value of \dfrac{M}{V} .

It can be proved that this value can be represented in the form of A +
B\sqrt{2} , where A and B are rational numbers. Let this B be represented as
an irreducible fraction \dfrac{p}{q} , your task is to print p*inv(q) modulo
999\,999\,893 (note the unusual modulo), where inv(q) is the [modular
inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) of q .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains an integer N (1 \leq N \leq 10^9 ),
the number of operations you perform on the square paper.

Output

For each test case, print on a new line the required answer.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the numerator (p) of the irreducible fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) to find its modular inverse modulo \(999\,999\,893\); p is the prime number \(999\,999\,893\).
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the modular inverse of 'a' modulo 999999893, which is calculated as \(a^{999999893-2} \mod 999999893\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `p`, where `a` is a positive integer and `p` is the prime number 999,999,893. It returns the modular inverse of `a` modulo 999,999,893, which is calculated as \(a^{999999893-2} \mod 999999893\). This calculation is performed using the built-in `pow` function in Python, which efficiently computes the modular exponentiation. The function handles the case where `a` and `p` are coprime, as required for the modular inverse to exist. If `a` and `p` are not coprime, the function will still execute but will return an incorrect result because the modular inverse does not exist in such cases. There are no explicit checks for this condition within the function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_2(N):
    if (N == 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        if (N == 2) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            return 714285638
            #The program returns 714285638
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `N` and returns one of three possible values based on the value of `N`. Specifically, it returns 0 if `N` is 1, 1 if `N` is 2, and 714285638 for any other value of `N`. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond checking the value of `N` and returning the appropriate result. The function does not modify any external state and solely relies on the input `N` to determine its output.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) after \(N\) operations on a square piece of paper.
   - After each operation, the side length of the square decreases, and the number of crease lines increases.
   - The final value of \(\frac{M}{V}\) is in the form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\).
   - We need to print \(p \cdot \text{inv}(q) \mod 999999893\), where \(\frac{p}{q}\) is the irreducible fraction form of \(B\).

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - **func_1(a, p):** This function computes \(a^{(p-2)} \mod p\), which is the modular inverse of \(a\) under modulo \(p\). However, the function signature suggests it should handle large primes like 999999893, but \(p\) is not used in the computation.
   - **func_2(N):** This function returns different values based on \(N\):
     - If \(N = 1\), it returns 0.
     - If \(N = 2\), it returns 1.
     - For \(N > 2\), it returns 714285638.

3. **Correctness of func_2(N):**
   - For \(N = 1\), \(\frac{M}{V} = 0\), so \(B = 0\), and the output is 0, which is correct.
   - For \(N = 2\), \(\frac{M}{V} = \sqrt{2} - 1\), so \(B = 1\), and the output is 1, which is correct.
   - For \(N > 2\), \(\frac{M}{V} = 2^{N-2} - 1\). The given value 714285638 is the result of \(2^{31} - 1 \mod 999999893\), which matches the pattern for \(N > 2\).

4. **Overall Functionality:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the cases for \(N = 1\), \(N = 2\), and \(N > 2\).
   - The modular arithmetic is correctly applied for \(N > 2\).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic for calculating \(\frac{M}{V}\) for the specified test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
