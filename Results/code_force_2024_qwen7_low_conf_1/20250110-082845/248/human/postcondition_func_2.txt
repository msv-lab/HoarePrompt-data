The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of operations performed on a square paper, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It calculates the values of `p` and `q` based on the given formulas and returns `func_2(p, q, MOD)` where `q` is computed as \((\_2_pwr_k^2 \times (2 \times a^2 - 4) + \_2_pwr_k \times 8 - 4) \mod \text{MOD}\). Here, `a` is derived from `n` using the operation `divmod(n, 2)`, which splits `n` into `k` and `r` such that \(n = 2k + r\). The function `func_1` is called to compute \(_2_pwr_k\), and `func_2` is used to process `p` and `q` modulo `999999893`.
