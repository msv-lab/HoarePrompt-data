The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers \(n\) and \(m\), followed by two lists of integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\). It then sorts list \(a\) in ascending order and list \(b\) in descending order. For each pair \((a[i], b[i])\) within the range of \(n\), it calculates the maximum absolute difference and accumulates these values into a variable `diff`. After processing all test cases, it prints the accumulated value of `diff` for each test case. The function handles the input constraints for \(t\), \(n\), \(m\), \(a_i\), and \(b_i\) as specified, ensuring that the sum of \(m\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).
