Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to maximize the total difference \(D\) by sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order before calculating the differences. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible difference \(D\). For example, consider the following input:

```
3 6
1 2 3 4
6 5 4 3 2 1
```

The program would sort `a` as `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `b` as `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. It then calculates the differences as follows:
- \(|1-6| + |2-5| + |3-4| + |4-3|\)

This results in:
- \(5 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 10\)

However, the optimal solution would be to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` in a way that maximizes the absolute differences. In this case, the optimal pairing would be:
- \(|1-1| + |2-2| + |3-5| + |4-6|\)

This results in:
- \(0 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 5\)

Therefore, the program does not always produce the maximum possible difference \(D\), making it incorrect.
