Reasoning:
The given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Reading and Sorting**:
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It then reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
   - The array \( a \) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array \( b \) is sorted in descending order.
3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - For each element in the arrays up to the length \( n \), it calculates the maximum absolute difference between the corresponding elements of the sorted arrays.
   - This ensures that the differences are maximized by pairing the smallest element of \( a \) with the largest element of \( b \), the second smallest element of \( a \) with the second largest element of \( b \), and so on.
4. **Accumulation of Differences**:
   - The program correctly accumulates the calculated differences into the variable `diff`.
5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the accumulated difference for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation details, the program should produce the correct results as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
