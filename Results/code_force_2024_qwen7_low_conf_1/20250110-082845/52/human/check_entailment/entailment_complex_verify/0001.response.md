### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) between Petya's array \(a\) and Vasya's array \(c\), where \(c\) is constructed from the elements of \(b\).

2. **Key Logic in the Program**:
   - The program sorts \(a\) in ascending order.
   - The program sorts \(b\) in descending order.
   - For each element in \(a\), it calculates the maximum possible difference by considering both the current position and the potential wrap-around (i.e., using the last element of \(b\) if the current index exceeds the bounds of \(b\)).

3. **Sorting and Pairing Strategy**:
   - Sorting \(a\) in ascending order ensures that the smallest elements in \(a\) are matched with the largest elements in \(b\).
   - Sorting \(b\) in descending order ensures that the largest elements in \(b\) are matched with the smallest elements in \(a\).
   - This strategy aims to maximize the absolute differences.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the index might exceed the bounds of \(b\) by using `a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]`. However, there is a mistake in the logic here. The correct approach should be to use the elements from the beginning of \(b\) since we are trying to maximize the differences by pairing smaller elements of \(a\) with larger elements of \(b\).

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should be: For each element in \(a\), pair it with the corresponding element in \(b\) starting from the end of \(b\). This ensures that the smallest elements in \(a\) are paired with the largest elements in \(b\), and vice versa.

6. **Review of the Program**:
   - The program currently uses `a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]`, which does not align with the intended logic of maximizing the differences.
   - The correct logic should use `b[i]` directly without the wrap-around.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the program correctly pairs the elements from the end of \(b\). The actual implementation does not follow this correct logic, leading to an incorrect result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the pairing of elements from \(a\) and \(b\) to maximize the differences. The correct approach involves pairing the smallest elements of \(a\) with the largest elements of \(b\) and vice versa, which is not achieved by the current implementation.
