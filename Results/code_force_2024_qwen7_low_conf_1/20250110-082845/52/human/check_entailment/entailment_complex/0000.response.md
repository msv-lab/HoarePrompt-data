Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.
3. It sorts list `a` in ascending order and list `b` in descending order.
4. It then iterates through the first `n` elements of both sorted lists and calculates the maximum absolute difference for each pair `(a[i], b[i])`.
5. The sum of these maximum absolute differences is stored in the variable `diff`.
6. The program ensures that the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed `2 Ã— 10^5`, as specified in the problem statement.
7. Finally, it prints the accumulated value of `diff` for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program logic appears to be correct. It correctly sorts the arrays `a` and `b` in the required orders and computes the maximum absolute differences as needed.

Therefore:
Correctness: **True**
