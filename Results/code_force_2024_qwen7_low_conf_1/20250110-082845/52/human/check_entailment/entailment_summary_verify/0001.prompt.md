You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        b.sort(reverse=True)
        diff = 0
        for i in range(n):
            diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))
        print(diff)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers \(n\) and \(m\), followed by two lists of integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\). It then sorts list \(a\) in ascending order and list \(b\) in descending order. For each pair \((a[i], b[i])\) within the range of \(n\), it calculates the maximum absolute difference and accumulates these values into a variable `diff`. After processing all test cases, it prints the accumulated value of `diff` for each test case. The function handles the input constraints for \(t\), \(n\), \(m\), \(a_i\), and \(b_i\) as specified, ensuring that the sum of \(m\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The given program attempts to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) between Petya's array \(a\) and Vasya's array \(c\).

2. To achieve this, the program:
   - Sorts Petya's array \(a\) in ascending order.
   - Sorts Vasya's array \(b\) in descending order.
   - For each element in \(a\), it calculates the maximum possible difference by considering both the current position and the potential wrap-around (i.e., using the last element of \(b\) if the current index exceeds the bounds of \(b\)).

3. The logic used in the program is sound. By sorting \(a\) in ascending order and \(b\) in descending order, the largest elements in \(b\) will be paired with the smallest elements in \(a\), and vice versa, thus maximizing the absolute differences.

4. The program correctly handles the edge case where the index might exceed the bounds of \(b\) by using `a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]`.

5. The overall approach ensures that the total difference \(D\) is maximized, as required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.
