Reasoning:

1. The given program attempts to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) between Petya's array \(a\) and Vasya's array \(c\).

2. To achieve this, the program:
   - Sorts Petya's array \(a\) in ascending order.
   - Sorts Vasya's array \(b\) in descending order.
   - For each element in \(a\), it calculates the maximum possible difference by considering both the current position and the potential wrap-around (i.e., using the last element of \(b\) if the current index exceeds the bounds of \(b\)).

3. The logic used in the program is sound. By sorting \(a\) in ascending order and \(b\) in descending order, the largest elements in \(b\) will be paired with the smallest elements in \(a\), and vice versa, thus maximizing the absolute differences.

4. The program correctly handles the edge case where the index might exceed the bounds of \(b\) by using `a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]`.

5. The overall approach ensures that the total difference \(D\) is maximized, as required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
