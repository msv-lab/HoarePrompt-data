Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.
   - `n` is an integer from the input.
   - `m` is an integer from the input.
   - `a` is a list of integers created from the input and now sorted.
   - `b` is a list of integers created from the input and now sorted in descending order.
   - `diff` is 0.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(0)` would result in no iterations).

3. **Required Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - Other variables like `t`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `diff` do not directly affect the ability of the loop to execute and thus do not need to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to run.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
