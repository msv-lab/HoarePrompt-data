`e1` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `e1` was unchanged from its initial state, and now it is reduced by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is `(s1 + 2) + 1`, `e1` is decreased by 1, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`, `s2` is `(s1 + 2) + 1`, `e2` is `e1 - 3`.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is `(s1 + 2) + 1`, `e1` is decreased by 1, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`, `s2` is `(s1 + 2) + 1`, `e2` is `e1 - 3**.
