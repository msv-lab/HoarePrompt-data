The code snippet `arr2.sort()` sorts the list `arr2`. Since the initial state does not provide the exact contents of `arr2`, we know that sorting will rearrange the elements of `arr2` in ascending order. However, since no specific values are given for `arr2`, we cannot determine the exact new order but we can state that `arr2` is now sorted.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states:
- `total` is unchanged
- `i` is `cases`
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order based on the input
- `s1` is `n - 1`
- `s2` is `m - 1`
- `e1` is 0
- `e2` is 0
- `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations plus `max(abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]), abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]))`
- `arr2` is updated based on user input (but its contents are now sorted)
- The condition `s1 == e1` is true

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order based on the input, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations plus `max(abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]), abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]))`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, and the condition `s1 == e1` is true.**
