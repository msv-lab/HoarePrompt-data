Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`.
  - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
  - `i` is `i + 1`.
  - `n` remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values and Conditions**:
   - `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `i` now is `i + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - To allow the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `i + 2` (since it was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `n` remains the same.

### Final State:
- `diff` will be updated according to the rule given.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `i` must be `i + 2`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` remains unchanged**.
