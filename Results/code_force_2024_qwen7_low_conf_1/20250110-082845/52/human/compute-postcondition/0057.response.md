The code updates the variable `d` by adding the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2`. The values of `sum1` and `sum2` are defined in terms of elements from `arr1` and `arr2`. However, the actual values of `arr1` and `arr2` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `sum1` and `sum2`. We only know that `sum1` and `sum2` are defined as follows:

- `sum1 = abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`
- `sum2 = abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`

The value of `d` is updated to include the maximum of these two sums. Since the exact values of `sum1` and `sum2` are not known, we can only state that `d` is now equal to `d + max(sum1, sum2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 3, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2]), `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1]), `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`**
