The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `diff`, `b`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `t` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`diff` is the sum of the maximum differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` remains unchanged, `i` is `2n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0**
