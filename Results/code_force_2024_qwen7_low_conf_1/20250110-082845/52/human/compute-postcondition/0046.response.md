Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `diff` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for all pairs `(a[i], b[i])` for all valid `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `diff` is printed after processing all test cases.**
