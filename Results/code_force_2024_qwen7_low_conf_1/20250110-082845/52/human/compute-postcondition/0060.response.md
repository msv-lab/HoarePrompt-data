`e1` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n - 2` to `n - 3`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `e1`.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 3, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`**
