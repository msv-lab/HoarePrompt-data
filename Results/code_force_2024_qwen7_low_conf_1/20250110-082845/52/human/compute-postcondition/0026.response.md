`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged.**
