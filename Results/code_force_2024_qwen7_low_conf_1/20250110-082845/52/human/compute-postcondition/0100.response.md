The code updates the value of `sum1` based on the given formula. Let's break it down:

1. The value of `s1` is `s1 + 2`.
2. The value of `e2` is `e1 - 3`.

The formula for `sum1` is:
\[ \text{sum1} = \left| \text{arr1}[\text{s1}] - \text{arr2}[\text{s2}] \right| + \left| \text{arr1}[\text{e1}] - \text{arr2}[\text{e2}] \right| \]

Since `s2` is updated to `s1 + 2` and `e2` is updated to `e1 - 3`, we can substitute these into the formula:
\[ \text{sum1} = \left| \text{arr1}[\text{s1} + 2] - \text{arr2}[\text{s1} + 2] \right| + \left| \text{arr1}[\text{e1}] - \text{arr2}[\text{e1} - 3] \right| \]

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is updated to `s1 + 2`, `e1` is unchanged, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is updated to \(\left| \text{arr1}[\text{s1} + 2] - \text{arr2}[\text{s1} + 2] \right| + \left| \text{arr1}[\text{e1}] - \text{arr2}[\text{e1} - 3] \right|\), `sum2` is unchanged, `s2` is `s1 + 2`, `e2` is `e1 - 3`**
