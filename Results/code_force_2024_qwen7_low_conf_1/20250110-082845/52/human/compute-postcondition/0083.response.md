To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the current state:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while s1 < e1 and s2 < e2:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the current state:
- `total` is unchanged
- `i` is `cases`
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order based on the input
- `s1` is 0
- `s2` is 0
- `e1` is 0
- `e2` is 0
- `d` is 0
- `arr2` is now sorted based on user input
- The condition `s1 == e1` is true

For the loop to execute at least once, the following conditions must be met:
1. `s1 < e1`
2. `s2 < e2`

Currently, both `s1` and `s2` are 0, and `e1` and `e2` are also 0. This means:
- `s1 == 0`
- `e1 == 0`
- `s2 == 0`
- `e2 == 0`

Since `s1 == e1` and `s2 == e2`, both conditions `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2` are false.

To make the loop execute at least once, we need to change either `s1` or `e1` such that `s1 < e1` becomes true, and similarly for `s2` and `e2`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `s1` must be less than `e1`
- `s2` must be less than `e2`

Since the values of `s1` and `s2` are currently 0 and `e1` and `e2` are also 0, we need to set `e1` and `e2` to some positive values greater than 0, and `s1` and `s2` to values less than `e1` and `e2`, respectively.

Here is the modified state:
State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order based on the input, `s1` must be less than `e1` (both non-zero), `s2` must be less than `e2` (both non-zero), `e1` and `e2` must be non-zero, `d` is 0, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, and the condition `s1 == e1` is no longer true.**

In practice, this means setting `e1` and `e2` to any positive values and setting `s1` and `s2` to values less than those positive values. For simplicity, we can assume initial values like `e1 = 1` and `e2 = 1` and `s1 = 0` and `s2 = 0` but ensuring they satisfy the loop condition.

So the final state is:
State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order based on the input, `s1` must be less than `e1` (both non-zero), `s2` must be less than `e2` (both non-zero), `e1` and `e2` must be non-zero, `d` is 0, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, and the condition `s1 == e1` is no longer true.**
