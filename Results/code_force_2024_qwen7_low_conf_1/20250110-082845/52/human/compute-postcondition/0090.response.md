The code `e2 -= 1` decrements the value of `e2` by 1. Since the initial value of `e2` is less than its original value (as indicated by `e2 < e2`), this operation changes its value but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is `s1 + 1`, `s2` is `s2 + 1`, `e2` is decreased by 1, `e1` is `e1 - 1`, `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])**
