The code `b.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `b` in descending order. This means that the elements of `b` will be arranged from the largest to the smallest value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers created from the input and now sorted; `b` is a list of integers created from the input and now sorted in descending order.**
