According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`, and `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 since the loop body will update `i` to the next value.

Given that `i` and `n` are unchanged from the previous iteration, and `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur, the condition for the next iteration is that `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is increased by 1, making it `i + 1`.

State: **`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged.**
