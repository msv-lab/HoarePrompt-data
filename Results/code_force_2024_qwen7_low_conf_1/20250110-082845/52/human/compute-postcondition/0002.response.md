The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100. However, the code provided does not use `t`, and only modifies `n` and `m`.

Since `t` is not affected by the code, its value remains the same. `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input split and converted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100; `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**
