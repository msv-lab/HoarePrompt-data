`s1` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 3, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`.
