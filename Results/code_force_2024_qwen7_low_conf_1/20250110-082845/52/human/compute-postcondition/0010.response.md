According to the given information, the state at the end of the previous iteration includes the following:

- `diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The value of `i` will increase by 1 because the loop iterates over `range(n)`.
2. Since the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, these variables will retain their previous values.
3. The value of `diff` will depend on the new value of `i` and the unchanged arrays `a` and `b`.

Let's denote the initial value of `i` at the start of the current iteration as `i_start`. At the end of the iteration, `i` becomes `i_start + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the range `0` to `n-1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `i_start + 1`, and `diff` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Since the exact initial value of `i` is not specified, we can represent it symbolically. Let's assume the initial value of `i` was `i_start`.

State: **`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i_start + 1] - b[i_start + 1])` and `abs(a[i_start + 1 - n] - b[i_start + 1 - n])`, `i` is `i_start + 1`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged**.
