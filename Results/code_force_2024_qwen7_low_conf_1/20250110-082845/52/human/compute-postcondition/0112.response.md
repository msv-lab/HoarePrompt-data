Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, `n` and `m` are input integers for each test case, `arr1` and `arr2` are lists of integers for each test case, `arr1` and `arr2` are sorted in ascending order, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the accumulated value of `max(sum1, sum2)` for each iteration, and the value of `d` is printed after all iterations.**
