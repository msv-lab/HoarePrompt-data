The code calculates `sum2` using the formula `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`. The values of `arr1`, `s1`, `e1`, `arr2`, `s2`, and `e2` remain unchanged from their previous values. The only new value calculated is `sum2`, which is the sum of two absolute differences.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is less than `e1`, `s2` is less than `e2`, `e1` and `e2` are non-zero, `d` is 0, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])**
