The code snippet `print(diff)` prints the value of the variable `diff`. However, it does not modify the value of `diff` itself. Therefore, the value of `diff` remains unchanged after executing this line of code.

Output State: **`diff` is the sum of the maximum differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for each pair (a[i], b[i]) and (a[i - n], b[i - n]) for i from 0 to n-1, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `2n`, `n` remains unchanged.**
