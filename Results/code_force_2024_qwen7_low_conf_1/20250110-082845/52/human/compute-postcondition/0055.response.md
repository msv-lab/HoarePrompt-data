`s1` and `s2` are both set to 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, and `e2` is `m - 2`. The code calculates `sum1` as the sum of two absolute differences between elements from `arr1` and `arr2`. Specifically, it computes `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s1` is 1
- `s2` is 1
- `e1` is `n - 2`
- `e2` is `m - 2`

We substitute these into the calculation for `sum1`:
- `sum1 = abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`

The values of `cases`, `n`, `m`, `arr1`, and `arr2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 3, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])**
