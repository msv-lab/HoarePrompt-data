The code `print(d)` simply prints the value of the variable `d`. Since no operations are performed on `d` within this line of code, the value of `d` remains unchanged. All other variables and their conditions also remain the same.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` is the original value of `n`, `m` is the original value of `m`, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations plus `max(abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]), abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]))`, and the condition `s1 == e1` is true.**
