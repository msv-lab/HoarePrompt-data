The code `arr1.sort()` sorts the list `arr1` in ascending order. Since `arr1` was initially in ascending order based on the input, sorting it again does not change its order. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` is still a list of integers in ascending order based on the input, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations plus `max(abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]), abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]))`, `arr2` is updated based on user input, and the condition `s1 == e1` is true.**
