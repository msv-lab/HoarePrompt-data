`s2` is incremented by 1. The value of `s2` was initially 0, so after the increment, `s2` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])).

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]))**
