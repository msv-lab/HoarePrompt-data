`a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, or the structure of `b`. After sorting, the list `a` will contain the same elements as before but in sorted order.

Since the initial state only mentions `a` as a list of integers created from the input, and no specific values are given for the elements of `a`, the output state will simply reflect that `a` is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers created from the input and now sorted; `b` is a list of integers created from the input**
