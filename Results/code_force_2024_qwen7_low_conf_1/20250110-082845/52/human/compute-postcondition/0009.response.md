The given code snippet updates the variable `diff` by adding the maximum of two absolute differences to it. However, the initial values of the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` are not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the changes made to the variables involved in the operation.

Let's assume the following for clarity (though the actual values are not provided):
- `a` and `b` are lists or arrays.
- `i` is an index within the range of both `a` and `b`.
- `n` is a positive integer (as per the initial state).

The code `diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` will execute as follows:

1. Calculate `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, which computes the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` in the lists `a` and `b`.
2. Calculate `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`, which computes the absolute difference between the elements at index `i - n` in the lists `a` and `b`.
3. Determine the maximum of these two absolute differences.
4. Add this maximum value to `diff`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` are not specified, we cannot provide specific numerical values for the changes. However, we can express the changes in terms of the variables involved.

Output State: **`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
