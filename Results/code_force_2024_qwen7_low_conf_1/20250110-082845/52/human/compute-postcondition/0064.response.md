The code updates the value of `sum2` to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`. We know the following from the initial state:
- `s1` is 2
- `e2` is `m - 3`
- `e1` is `n - 3`
- `s2` is 2

Substituting these values into the expression for `sum2`:

\[
sum2 = abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])
\]

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 6, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`**
