The code `e1 -= 1` decrements the value of `e1` by 1. Initially, `e1` is `n - 3`. After decrementing, the new value of `e1` is `(n - 3) - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 4`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 6, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 3, `s2` is 3, `e1` is `n - 4`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`**
