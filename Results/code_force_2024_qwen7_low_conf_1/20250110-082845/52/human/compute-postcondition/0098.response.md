The code `e2 -= 1` decrements `e2` by 1. Based on the initial state, `e2` was previously `e1 - 2`. After this operation, `e2` becomes `(e1 - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `e1 - 3`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is increased by 1, `e1` is `e1 - 2`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2 - 1]) + abs(arr1[e1 - 1] - arr2[s2]), `s2` is `s1 + 2`, `e2` is `e1 - 3`**
