According to the code, the loop continues as long as `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2`. We need to ensure both conditions are met for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `cases` is greater than 3
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `arr1` is sorted in ascending order
- `s1` is 1
- `s2` is 1
- `e1` is `n - 2`
- `e2` is `m - 2`
- `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]))

For the loop to continue:
1. `s1` must be less than `e1`: Currently, `s1` is 1 and `e1` is `n - 2`. For the loop to continue, `n` must be such that `s1 < e1`, meaning `n` must be at least 3 (since `s1` is already 1).
2. `s2` must be less than `e2`: Currently, `s2` is 1 and `e2` is `m - 2`. For the loop to continue, `m` must be such that `s2 < e2`, meaning `m` must be at least 3 (since `s2` is already 1).

No other states need to be adjusted based on the given conditions. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` and `m` to ensure they are at least 3.

State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 3, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]))**
