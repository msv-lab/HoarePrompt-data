The code reads a list of integers from input and assigns it to `b`. This means that the previous value of `b`, which was a sorted list of integers in descending order, is no longer relevant, and `b` now contains the newly input list of integers.

The output state will reflect this change:

Output State: **`diff` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input (not necessarily sorted or in descending order)**
