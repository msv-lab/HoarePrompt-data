To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current values of the relevant variables.

The given `while` loop condition is:
```python
while s1 < e1 and s2 < e2:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's break down the condition:
- The loop continues as long as `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2`.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s1` is 2
- `s2` is 2
- `e1` is `n - 3`
- `e2` is `m - 3`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2` must hold true.

### Analyzing `s1 < e1`:
- `s1` is currently 2.
- `e1` is `n - 3`.

For `s1 < e1` to be true, `2 < n - 3`, which simplifies to `n > 5`.

### Analyzing `s2 < e2`:
- `s2` is currently 2.
- `e2` is `m - 3`.

For `s2 < e2` to be true, `2 < m - 3`, which simplifies to `m > 5`.

### Summary of Required Adjustments:
- To ensure `s1 < e1` is true, `n` must be greater than 5.
- To ensure `s2 < e2` is true, `m` must be greater than 5.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 5
- `m` must be greater than 5

The final answer is:
State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 6, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`**
