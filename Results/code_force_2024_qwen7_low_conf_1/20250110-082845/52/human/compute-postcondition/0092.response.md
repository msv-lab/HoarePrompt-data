Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` must be less than `e1` initially, `s2` must be less than `e2` initially, `e2` is decreased by 1, `e1` is `e1 - 1`, `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` remains unchanged**.

The code updates `sum1` to the value of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
