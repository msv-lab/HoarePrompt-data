The code `d += max(sum1, sum2)` increments the value of `d` by the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2`. The variables `s1`, `e1`, `s2`, `e2`, `arr1`, `arr2`, `sum1`, and `sum2` are updated according to the previous steps, but their exact values are not specified. The only change here is to `d`.

Since the exact values of `sum1` and `sum2` are not given, we represent them as `sum1` and `sum2` respectively.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` must be less than `e1` initially, `s2` must be less than `e2` initially, `e2` is decreased by 1, `e1` is `e1 - 1`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2 - 1]) + abs(arr1[e1 - 1] - arr2[s2])**
