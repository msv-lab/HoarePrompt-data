The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The other variables (`diff`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `b`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`diff` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**
