According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i_start + 1] - b[i_start + 1])` and `abs(a[i_start + 1 - n] - b[i_start + 1 - n])`.
- `i` is `i_start + 2`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently `i_start + 2`, the next value of `i` will be `i_start + 3`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be `i_start + 3`.
- The other variables (`diff`, `a`, `b`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

State: **`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i_start + 1] - b[i_start + 1])` and `abs(a[i_start + 1 - n] - b[i_start + 1 - n])`, `i` is `i_start + 3`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged**
