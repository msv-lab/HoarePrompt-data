The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers separated by a space from the standard input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This means the variables `n` and `m` are now assigned new values from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`diff` is the sum of the maximum differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `2n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0**
