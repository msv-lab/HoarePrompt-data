The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this operation.

Since the initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `m` are integers with specific conditions, and the code only manipulates the input related to the `input()` function, the output state will include the updated list `a` and the unchanged variables `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers created from the input**
