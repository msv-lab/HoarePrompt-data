The code initializes `diff` to 0, which means it sets `diff` to an integer value of 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `diff` has been updated to 0, while all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`diff` is 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers read from input sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order**
