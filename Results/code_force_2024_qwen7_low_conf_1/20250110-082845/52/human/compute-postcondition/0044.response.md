Output State: **`a` is sorted, `b` is sorted in reverse order, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` for all valid `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, `diff` accumulates the maximum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements in the arrays `a` and `b`.
- After the loop completes, `diff` contains the sum of these maximum absolute differences for all pairs of elements in the specified range.

Since the loop runs `n` times (from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`), the final value of `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` for all valid `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.
