The code snippet `n, m = [int(a) for a in input().split()]` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This changes the values of `n` and `m`. All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations plus `max(abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]), abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]))`, and the condition `s1 == e1` is true.**
