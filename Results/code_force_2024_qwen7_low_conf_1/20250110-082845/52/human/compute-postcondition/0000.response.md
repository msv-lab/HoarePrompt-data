The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, after executing the code, the value of `t` will be updated to the integer input from the user, but it will still be within the range of 1 to 100 because the input is constrained to this range.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input from the user, and it is between 1 and 100**
