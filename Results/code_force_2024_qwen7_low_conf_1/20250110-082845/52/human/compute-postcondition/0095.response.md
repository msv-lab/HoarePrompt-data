`s1` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is increased by 1, `e1` is `e1 - 1`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2 - 1]) + abs(arr1[e1 - 1] - arr2[s2])`.
