Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `s1 < e1 and s2 < e2`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `total` is unchanged.
   - `i` is `cases`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order.
   - `s1` is `s1 + 1`.
   - `s2` is `s2 + 1`.
   - `e2` is decreased by 1.
   - `e1` is `e1 - 1`.
   - `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`.
   - `arr2` is now sorted based on user input.
   - `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`.
   - `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop must be true:
- `s1 < e1`
- `s2 < e2`

Given the current states:
- `s1` has been incremented by 1 (`s1 = s1 + 1`).
- `s2` has been incremented by 1 (`s2 = s2 + 1`).
- `e2` has been decreased by 1 (`e2 = e2 - 1`).
- `e1` has been decremented by 1 (`e1 = e1 - 1`).

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time:
- `s1` must be less than `e1` before the increment.
- `s2` must be less than `e2` before the increment.

Since `s1` and `s2` were incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `s1 - 1 < e1` and `s2 - 1 < e2` before the increment happens. This means:
- `s1` must be initially within range such that `s1 - 1 < e1`.
- `s2` must be initially within range such that `s2 - 1 < e2`.

Thus, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- Ensure `s1` is initially less than `e1` (i.e., `s1 < e1`).
- Ensure `s2` is initially less than `e2` (i.e., `s2 < e2`).

So, the adjusted states are:
- `s1` must be less than `e1` initially.
- `s2` must be less than `e2` initially.

The final answer is:
State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` must be less than `e1` initially, `s2` must be less than `e2` initially, `e2` is decreased by 1, `e1` is `e1 - 1`, `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])**
