`s2` is incremented by 1. The value of `s1` is `s1 + 1`, and it was already in this form, so it remains the same. All other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `s2`.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is `s1 + 1`, `s2` is `s2 + 1`, `e2` is less than `e2`, `e1` and `e2` are non-zero, `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])**
