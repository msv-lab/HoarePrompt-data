The code initializes the variable `diff` to 0. None of the existing variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `t`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is sorted, `b` is sorted in reverse order, `i` is 2n, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `diff` is 0**
