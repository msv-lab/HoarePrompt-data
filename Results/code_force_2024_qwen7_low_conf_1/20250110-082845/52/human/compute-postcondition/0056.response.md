`sum2` is assigned the value of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`. Given the initial conditions, `s1` is 1 and `s2` is 1, and `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`. So, `sum2` becomes `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 3, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2]), `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])**
