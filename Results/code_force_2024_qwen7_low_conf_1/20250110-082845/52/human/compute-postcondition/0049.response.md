The code `d += max(sum1, sum2)` updates the variable `d` by adding the maximum value between `sum1` and `sum2` to `d`. Given the initial state, we know that:

- `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`
- `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`

Since both `sum1` and `sum2` are sums of absolute differences, `max(sum1, sum2)` will be one of these two values. Therefore, `d` is updated by adding this maximum value.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]))**, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`
