The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state specifies that `diff` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order. After executing this line of code, the values of `diff`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, but `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`diff` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**
