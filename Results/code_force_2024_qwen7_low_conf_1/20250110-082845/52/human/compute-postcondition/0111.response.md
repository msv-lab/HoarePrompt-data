The code snippet `print(d)` simply prints the value of `d`. No new variables are assigned, and no changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is equal to `e1`, `s2` is equal to `e2`, `e1` is equal to `s1`, `e2` is equal to `s2`, `d` is the accumulated value of `max(sum1, sum2)` for each iteration. If `s1 == e1`, `d` is additionally incremented by `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2])`. After executing `print(d)`, the value of `d` is printed.**
