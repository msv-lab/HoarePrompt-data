Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` is the original value of `n`, `m` is the original value of `m`, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations where `sum1 = abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])` and `sum2 = abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`**

This output state reflects that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `s1` and `s2` will both be equal to `n - 1` and `m - 1` respectively, while `e1` and `e2` will both be 0. The value of `d` will be the cumulative sum of `max(sum1, sum2)` for each iteration of the loop.
