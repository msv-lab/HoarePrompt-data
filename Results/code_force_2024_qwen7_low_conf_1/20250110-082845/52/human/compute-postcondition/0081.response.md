The code assigns the values of `0` to `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, and `e2`. These assignments do not change the actual values of these variables but set them to specific values (`0` for `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, and `e2`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order based on the input, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations plus `max(abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]), abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]))`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, and the condition `s1 == e1` is true.**
