The code `e1 -= 1` decrements the value of `e1` by 1. The value of `e1` was previously defined such that `e1` and `e2` are non-zero, and `e2` is less than `e2`. Since `e2` is less than itself, this condition is inherently true and does not provide new information. The value of `e1` is now `e1 - 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is `s1 + 1`, `s2` is `s2 + 1`, `e2` is less than `e2`, `e1` is `e1 - 1`, `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])**
