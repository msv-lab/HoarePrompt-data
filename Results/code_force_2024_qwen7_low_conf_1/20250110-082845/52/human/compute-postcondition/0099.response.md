Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States:
- `total` is unchanged.
- `i` is `cases`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order.
- `s1` is increased by 1.
- `e1` is `e1 - 2`.
- `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`.
- `arr2` is now sorted based on user input.
- `sum1` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`.
- `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2 - 1]) + abs(arr1[e1 - 1] - arr2[s2])`.
- `s2` is `s1 + 2`.
- `e2` is `e1 - 3`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is:
```python
while s1 < e1 and s2 < e2:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2` must hold true.

1. **Condition `s1 < e1`:**
   - After the previous iteration, `s1` was increased by 1.
   - Let's denote the value of `s1` after the previous iteration as `s1_prev` and the value of `e1` as `e1_prev`.
   - Therefore, `s1 = s1_prev + 1` and `e1 = e1_prev - 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, we need `s1 + 1 < e1 - 2`.
   - Substituting the values: `(s1_prev + 1) < (e1_prev - 2)`.
   - Simplifying: `s1_prev + 3 < e1_prev`.

2. **Condition `s2 < e2`:**
   - After the previous iteration, `s2` is set to `s1 + 2` and `e2` is set to `e1 - 3`.
   - Therefore, `s2 = s1_prev + 2` and `e2 = e1_prev - 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, we need `s2 < e2`.
   - Substituting the values: `(s1_prev + 2) < (e1_prev - 3)`.
   - Simplifying: `s1_prev + 5 < e1_prev`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following conditions must be satisfied:
- `s1_prev + 3 < e1_prev`
- `s1_prev + 5 < e1_prev`

Since `s1` and `e1` are directly dependent on `s1_prev` and `e1_prev`, we need to adjust `s1` and `e1` to satisfy these conditions. However, since `s1` and `e1` are already defined in terms of `s1_prev` and `e1_prev`, we need to ensure that the initial values of `s1_prev` and `e1_prev` are such that the above conditions hold true.

Given that `s1` and `e1` are derived from the previous iteration, the adjustments should focus on ensuring the loop condition holds true based on the current values of `s1` and `e1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` must be such that `s1 + 3 < e1`, `e1` must be such that `s1 + 5 < e1`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2 - 1]) + abs(arr1[e1 - 1] - arr2[s2])`, `s2` is `s1 + 2`, `e2` is `e1 - 3`**
