According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is sorted, `b` is sorted in reverse order, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, and `diff` is `max(abs(a[0] - b[0]), abs(a[-n] - b[-n]))`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `i` is currently 0, so for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`a` is sorted, `b` is sorted in reverse order, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `diff` is `max(abs(a[0] - b[0]), abs(a[-n] - b[-n]))`**
