`e1` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `e1` is `n - 1`, so the new value of `e1` is now `(n - 1) - 1 = n - 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]))**
