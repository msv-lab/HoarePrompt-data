`sum1` is reassigned the value of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`. Given the initial values, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, and `e2` is `m - 3`. So, the expression simplifies to `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`.

The other variables are not affected, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 6, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`**
