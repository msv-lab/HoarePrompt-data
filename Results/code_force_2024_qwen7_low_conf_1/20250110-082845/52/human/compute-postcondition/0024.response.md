The code snippet updates the variable `diff` by adding the maximum of two absolute differences: `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n`. We know that `diff` is being updated, but we cannot determine its exact value without more context.

Output State: **`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` and `n` are unchanged.**
