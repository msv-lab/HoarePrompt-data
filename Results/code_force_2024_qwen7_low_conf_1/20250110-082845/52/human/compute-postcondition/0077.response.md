The code snippet `arr1 = [int(a) for a in input().split()]` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr1`. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`, `d`) are not affected by this operation.

Since the initial state of `arr1` being sorted in ascending order is preserved and the input is converted to integers, the new `arr1` will also be a list of integers in ascending order. However, the specific values of the elements in `arr1` depend on the input provided.

Given the precondition that `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, the output state will be:

- `arr1` is updated to a list of integers in ascending order based on the input.
- All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` is a list of integers in ascending order based on the input, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations plus `max(abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]), abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]))`, and the condition `s1 == e1` is true.**
