The code `print(diff)` simply prints the value of `diff`. It does not change the value of `diff` or any other variable. Therefore, the only change is that the value of `diff` is printed. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`diff` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `diff` is printed.**
