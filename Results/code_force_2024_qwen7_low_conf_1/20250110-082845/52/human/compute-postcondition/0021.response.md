The code snippet sorts the list `b` in descending order using `b.sort(reverse=True)`. This operation changes the order of elements in `b` without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`diff` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`; `n` is an integer read from input; `m` is an integer read from input; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order.**
