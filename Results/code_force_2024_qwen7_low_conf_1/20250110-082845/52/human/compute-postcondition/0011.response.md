The code updates the variable `diff` by adding to it the maximum of two values: `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `i_start + 1`, and `diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i_start + 1] - b[i_start + 1])` and `abs(a[i_start + 1 - n] - b[i_start + 1 - n])`.

After the code execution:
- `diff` is updated to include the maximum of `abs(a[i_start + 1] - b[i_start + 1])` and `abs(a[i_start + 1 - n] - b[i_start + 1 - n])`.
- `i` is now `i_start + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `i_start + 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i_start + 1] - b[i_start + 1])` and `abs(a[i_start + 1 - n] - b[i_start + 1 - n])`, `i` is `i_start + 2`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
