Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cases` is greater than 3.
   - `n` is the original value of `n`.
   - `m` is the original value of `m`.
   - `arr1` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `s1` is `n - 1`.
   - `s2` is `m - 1`.
   - `e1` is 0.
   - `e2` is 0.
   - `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations plus `max(abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]), abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]))`.
   - The condition `s1 == e1` is true.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(cases):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `i < cases`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to `cases - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `cases`.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `i` will become `cases`.
   - Since `cases` is greater than 3, `i < cases` will still be true, meaning the loop can continue.
   - Other variables like `n`, `m`, `arr1`, `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`, and `d` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.

6. **Final State:**
   - `total` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it remains unchanged or is updated within the loop body.
   - `i` becomes `cases`.
   - `n` remains the original value of `n`.
   - `m` remains the original value of `m`.
   - `arr1` remains sorted in ascending order.
   - `s1` remains `n - 1`.
   - `s2` remains `m - 1`.
   - `e1` remains 0.
   - `e2` remains 0.
   - `d` remains the same unless modified within the loop body.

Given these points, the final state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is the original value of `n`, `m` is the original value of `m`, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations plus `max(abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]), abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]))`, and the condition `s1 == e1` is true.**
