The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will take inputs through other means (such as global variables or external calls) within its scope. Given the constraints, it appears that the function will process a series of test cases, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`.

The function will handle multiple test cases, where for each test case:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).

Given the nature of the problem, the function likely returns some form of result for each test case, possibly a list or dictionary containing results for all test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases consisting of integers \(n\), \(m\), \(a_i\), and \(b_i\) with specified constraints, and returns results for each test case.**
