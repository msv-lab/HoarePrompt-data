`e2` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `m - 3` to `m - 4`. The value of `m` remains unchanged, so `e2` is now `m - 4`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 6, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 3, `s2` is 3, `e1` is `n - 4`, `e2` is `m - 4`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 6, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 3, `s2` is 3, `e1` is `n - 4`, `e2` is `m - 4`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`**
