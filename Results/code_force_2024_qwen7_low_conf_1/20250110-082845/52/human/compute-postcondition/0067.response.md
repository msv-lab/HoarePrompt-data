`s2` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s2` is 2, so the new value of `s2` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 6, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 3, `s2` is 3, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`**
