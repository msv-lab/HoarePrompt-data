`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 2`, and `n` remains unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` remain unchanged, their values are not altered. The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`diff` is increased by the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` remains unchanged**
