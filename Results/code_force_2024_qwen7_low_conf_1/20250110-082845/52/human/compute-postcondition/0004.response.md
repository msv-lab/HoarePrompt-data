The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `b`. 

Since the initial state includes that `t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` is an integer from the input, and `m` is an integer from the input, and `a` is a list of integers created from the input, the new list `b` will contain the same integers as `a`, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers created from the input; `b` is a list of integers created from the input**.
