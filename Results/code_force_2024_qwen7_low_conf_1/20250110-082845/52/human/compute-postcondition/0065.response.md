The code updates the value of `d` by adding `max(sum1, sum2)` to it. The values of `sum1` and `sum2` are defined as follows:

- `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`
- `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])`

Since `max(sum1, sum2)` will be one of these two sums (depending on which is larger), we need to determine which sum is larger. However, without specific values for `arr1`, `arr2`, `n`, and `m`, we cannot determine which sum is larger directly. Instead, we know that `d` will be updated by the larger of the two sums.

Therefore, the updated state of the variable `d` will be `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, where `max(sum1, sum2)` is the larger of the two sums calculated above.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 6, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`**
