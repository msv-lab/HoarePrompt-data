`a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables are not affected. The initial state is given as follows:

- `diff` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `n` is an integer read from input.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `b` is a list of integers read from input.

After executing `a.sort()`, the list `a` will be sorted in ascending order, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`diff` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`; `n` is an integer read from input; `m` is an integer read from input; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers read from input.**
