Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 3, `n` is the original value of `n`, `m` is the original value of `m`, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated during the loop iterations where `sum1 = abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])` and `sum2 = abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`. The condition `s1 == e1` is true.***
