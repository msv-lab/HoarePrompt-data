`e2` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `e2` is `m - 1`. Therefore, the new value of `e2` is `(m - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `m - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr1` is sorted in ascending order, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1]), abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]))**
