Let's go through the code step by step:

- The initial state includes:
  - `total` is unchanged
  - `i` is `cases`
  - `n` is an input integer
  - `m` is an input integer
  - `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order
  - `s1` must be less than `e1` initially
  - `s2` must be less than `e2` initially
  - `e2` is decreased by 1, so `e2 = e2 - 1`
  - `e1` is `e1 - 1`
  - `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`
  - `arr2` is now sorted based on user input
  - `sum1` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`
  - `sum2` remains unchanged

The code snippet provided is:
```python
sum2 = abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])
```

This line updates the value of `sum2` based on the new indices `s1` and `e1` (both decremented), and the elements from `arr1` and `arr2` at those indices.

Given the initial conditions, let's update `sum2`:

- `s1` is unchanged
- `e1` is updated to `e1 - 1`
- `e2` is updated to `e2 - 1`

So, the updated `sum2` is:
\[ \text{sum2} = \text{abs}(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2 - 1]) + \text{abs}(arr1[e1 - 1] - arr2[s2]) \]

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` must be less than `e1` initially, `s2` must be less than `e2` initially, `e2` is decreased by 1, `e1` is `e1 - 1`, `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum1` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`, `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2 - 1]) + abs(arr1[e1 - 1] - arr2[s2])**
