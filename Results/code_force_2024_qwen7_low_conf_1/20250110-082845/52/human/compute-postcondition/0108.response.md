Postcondition: ***`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is equal to `e1`. The current value of `s1` equals `e1`. `s2` is equal to `e2`, `e1` is equal to `s1`, `e2` is equal to `s2`, `d` is the accumulated value of `max(sum1, sum2)` for each iteration.***
