The code `e2 -= 1` decrements the value of `e2` by 1. Given that `e2` was previously `e1 - 3`, after this operation, `e2` will be `e1 - 4`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is `(s1 + 2) + 1`, `e1` is decreased by 1, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`, `s2` is `(s1 + 2) + 1`, `e2` is `e1 - 4`**
