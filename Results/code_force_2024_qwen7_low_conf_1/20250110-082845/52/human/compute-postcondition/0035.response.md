The code sorts the list `a`. Sorting `a` changes its order, but does not affect the values of other variables. The value of `i` remains `2n`, `n` remains an input integer, `m` remains an input integer, and `t` remains greater than 0.

Output State: **`a` is sorted, `b` is unchanged, `i` is 2n, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0**
