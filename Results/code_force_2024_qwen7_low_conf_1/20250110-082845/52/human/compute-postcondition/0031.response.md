According to the code, the loop iterates `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `diff` is the sum of the maximum differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` and `(a[i - n], b[i - n])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `i` is `2n`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the condition under which the loop continues. The loop will continue if `t` is greater than 0. Since `i` is `2n`, it does not affect the loop continuation directly, and `n` remains unchanged. The only variable that changes is `t`, which decreases by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `diff` remains unchanged.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `i` remains `2n`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `t` is reduced by 1, so `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`diff` is the sum of the maximum differences between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for each pair `(a[i], b[i])` and `(a[i - n], b[i - n])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `2n`, `n` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0**
