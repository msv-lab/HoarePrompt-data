`s2` is incremented by 1. The value of `s2` was `s1 + 2`, so now it becomes `(s1 + 2) + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is `(s1 + 2) + 1`, `e1` is unchanged, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`, `s2` is `(s1 + 2) + 1`, `e2` is `e1 - 3`.**
