The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. Instead, it appears to operate based on implicit input, possibly from external sources such as a list of test cases. The constraints provided describe the ranges and properties of potential input values but do not indicate that these are passed directly to the function.

Given the output description, it seems the function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes:
- `t`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- For each of the `t` test cases:
  - `n` and `m`: Integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).
  - `a_i` and `b_i`: Integers such that \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).

The function likely processes each test case and returns results based on the input data, but since the function definition does not show any parameters being passed in, we infer the input is derived from some external source.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and `m`, and for each pair, two integers `a_i` and `b_i`. It returns results based on the processed input data.**
