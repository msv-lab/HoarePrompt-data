The code updates the value of `d` by adding `max(sum1, sum2)` to its current value. Since `sum1` and `sum2` are not defined in the initial state, their values remain unchanged from the previous state. The other variables are also unaffected.

Therefore, the updated state of `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`.

Output State: **`total` is unchanged, `i` is `cases`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr1` remains a list of integers in ascending order, `s1` is updated to `s1 + 2`, `e1` is unchanged, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `arr2` is now sorted based on user input, `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`, `s2` is `s1 + 2`, `e2` is `e1 - 3`.**
