Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key aspects of the program and how they align with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case, extracting the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for each case. This part correctly handles the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Score Validation and Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the program checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is even and if `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`. If either condition is violated, the result is `-1`, which matches the requirement to print `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.
   - If the conditions are met, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. This calculation ensures that the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins, losses, and draws, which aligns with the problem description.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program prints the calculated maximum number of draws or `-1` for each test case. The output format matches the problem description, where for each test case, one number (either `-1` or the maximum possible number of draws) is printed.

Given these points, the program accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases, including edge cases like when the total points are odd or when the highest score exceeds the sum of the other two scores. Therefore, the program is correct.
