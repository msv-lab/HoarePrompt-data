You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((p1, p2, p3))
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in test_cases:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        
        max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)
        
        results.append(max_draws)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `results` is a list of integers where each element is either -1 or `max_draws`, `max_draws` is defined as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` if the conditions `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2` are not met, otherwise the element is -1.
    return results
    #`The program returns a list of integers where each element is either -1 or max_draws, with max_draws being defined as min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1) if the conditions total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2 are not met, otherwise the element is -1`

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
