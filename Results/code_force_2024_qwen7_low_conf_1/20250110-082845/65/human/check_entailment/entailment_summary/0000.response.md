Reasoning:
The given program appears to be correctly designed to solve the problem. Let's break down the solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by splitting the input into \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It iterates over each test case.
   - It calculates the total points which is the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `total_points % 2 != 0`: This ensures that the total points must be even because each game contributes either 2 points to the winners or 2 points in total (1 point each in a draw).
     - `p3 > p1 + p2`: This condition checks if the score of the highest scorer can be achieved by winning all games against the other two without drawing, which would contradict the given score distribution.
   - If either condition is true, it appends \(-1\) to the results list, indicating an invalid score configuration.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula \( \min(p_1, p_3 - p_2) + \min(p_2, p_3 - p_1) \). This formula considers the possible maximum draws based on the scores:
     - \(p_3 - p_2\) gives the difference in points between the top two players, and similarly, \(p_3 - p_1\) for the difference between the top and middle players.
     - The minimum of these differences plus the minimum of the middle and top player's scores accounts for the potential draws.

Given this analysis, the program correctly handles the conditions and computes the maximum possible number of draws for each test case. Therefore, the program logic matches the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
