You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((p1, p2, p3))
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in test_cases:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)
        results.append(max_draws)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \) such that \( 0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 \). It returns a list of integers where each element is either \(-1\) or `max_draws`. Here, `max_draws` is defined as \( \min(p_1, p_3 - p_2) + \min(p_2, p_3 - p_1) \) if the conditions `total_points % 2 != 0` or \( p_3 > p_1 + p_2 \) are not met; otherwise, the element is \(-1\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and calculating the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \).

Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \).

2. **Validation and Calculation:**
   - It checks if the total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) are even because an odd total points cannot be achieved from a combination of wins and draws where wins give 2 points and draws give 1 point to each player.
   - It checks if \( p_3 \leq p_1 + p_2 \) to ensure that the highest score does not exceed the sum of the other two scores.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the above conditions are satisfied, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{max\_draws} = \min(p1, p3 - p2) + \min(p2, p3 - p1)
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the calculation considers the possible maximum draws between the pairs while respecting the constraints.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

Given the logic and the conditions checked, the program correctly handles the validation and the calculation of the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the provided program is correct for the given problem statement.
