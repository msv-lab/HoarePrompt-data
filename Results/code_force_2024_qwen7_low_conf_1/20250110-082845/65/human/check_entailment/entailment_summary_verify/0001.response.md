### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the given function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the scores for each test case.

2. **Validation and Calculation:**
   - The program checks if the total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) are even. This is a necessary condition because the total points must be even to be achievable from combinations of wins (2 points) and draws (2 points each for two players).
   - The program also checks if \( p_3 \leq p_1 + p_2 \). This ensures that the highest score does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be achievable.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{max\_draws} = \min(p1, p3 - p2) + \min(p2, p3 - p1)
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - \(\min(p1, p3 - p2)\): This term accounts for the possibility of draws between the player with score \( p_1 \) and the difference between the highest score \( p_3 \) and the middle score \( p_2 \).
     - \(\min(p2, p3 - p1)\): This term accounts for the possibility of draws between the player with score \( p_2 \) and the difference between the highest score \( p_3 \) and the lowest score \( p_1 \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of draws or \(-1\) if the conditions are not met.

### Evaluation

Let's use the provided examples to verify the correctness of the program:

- **Example 1:** \( (0, 0, 0) \)
  - Total points: \( 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \) (even)
  - \( p_3 \leq p_1 + p_2 \) holds true.
  - \(\text{max\_draws} = \min(0, 0 - 0) + \min(0, 0 - 0) = 0 + 0 = 0\)
  - Output: \( 0 \)

- **Example 2:** \( (0, 1, 1) \)
  - Total points: \( 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \) (even)
  - \( p_3 \leq p_1 + p_2 \) holds true.
  - \(\text{max\_draws} = \min(0, 1 - 1) + \min(1, 1 - 0) = 0 + 1 = 1\)
  - Output: \( 1 \)

- **Example 3:** \( (1, 1, 1) \)
  - Total points: \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \) (odd)
  - Output: \(-1\)

- **Example 4:** \( (1, 1, 2) \)
  - Total points: \( 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \) (even)
  - \( p_3 \leq p_1 + p_2 \) holds true.
  - \(\text{max\_draws} = \min(1, 2 - 1) + \min(1, 2 - 1) = 1 + 1 = 2\)
  - Output: \( 2 \)

- **Example 5:** \( (3, 3, 3) \)
  - Total points: \( 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \) (odd)
  - Output: \(-1\)

- **Example 6:** \( (3, 4, 5) \)
  - Total points: \( 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 \) (even)
  - \( p_3 \leq p_1 + p_2 \) does not hold (\(5 \not\leq 3 + 4\)).
  - Output: \(-1\)

- **Example 7:** \( (1, 1, 10) \)
  - Total points: \( 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 \) (even)
  - \( p_3 \leq p_1 + p_2 \) does not hold (\(10 \not\leq 1 + 1\)).
  - Output: \(-1\)

The program correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem statement. The logic and the conditions checked in the program match the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
