Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the scores for each test case.
- The function `func_1` processes each test case to determine if the given scores can be achieved through a series of chess games and calculates the maximum possible number of draws.
- The logic in the function is as follows:
  1. It checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are odd or if `p3` exceeds `p1 + p2`. If either condition is true, it returns `-1` because these conditions make it impossible to achieve the given scores through any series of games.
  2. If the conditions are not met, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.
- The calculations and logic in the function seem to align with the problem statement and constraints. The conditions and the formula used are appropriate for determining if the scores are achievable and for calculating the maximum number of draws.
- The output is formatted correctly as required by the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
