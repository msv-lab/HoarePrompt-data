Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and calculating the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \).

Here is a detailed breakdown of the solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \).

2. **Validation and Calculation:**
   - It checks if the total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) are even because an odd total points cannot be achieved from a combination of wins and draws where wins give 2 points and draws give 1 point to each player.
   - It checks if \( p_3 \leq p_1 + p_2 \) to ensure that the highest score does not exceed the sum of the other two scores.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the above conditions are satisfied, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{max\_draws} = \min(p1, p3 - p2) + \min(p2, p3 - p1)
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the calculation considers the possible maximum draws between the pairs while respecting the constraints.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

Given the logic and the conditions checked, the program correctly handles the validation and the calculation of the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the provided program is correct for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
