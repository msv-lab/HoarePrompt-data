### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the annotations and the original assessment:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the scores \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \).

2. **Validation and Calculation:**
   - The validation step checks if the total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) are even. This is necessary because the total points must be even for the scores to be achievable.
   - The second validation checks if \( p_3 \leq p_1 + p_2 \). This ensures that the highest score does not exceed the sum of the other two scores, which is a logical constraint given the scoring system.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{max\_draws} = \min(p1, p3 - p2) + \min(p2, p3 - p1)
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - \( \min(p1, p3 - p2) \) calculates the maximum number of draws between players 1 and 3.
     - \( \min(p2, p3 - p1) \) calculates the maximum number of draws between players 2 and 3.
   - The sum of these minimum values gives the maximum possible number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the total points are odd or if \( p_3 > p1 + p2 \), the program correctly outputs -1, indicating that the scores are inconsistent with the rules of the game.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Test Case Analysis:**
  - **Case 1:** \( (0, 0, 0) \)
    - Total points: \( 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \) (even)
    - \( p3 \leq p1 + p2 \): True
    - Max draws: \( \min(0, 0 - 0) + \min(0, 0 - 0) = 0 \)
    - Result: 0
  - **Case 2:** \( (0, 1, 1) \)
    - Total points: \( 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \) (even)
    - \( p3 \leq p1 + p2 \): True
    - Max draws: \( \min(0, 1 - 1) + \min(1, 1 - 0) = 1 \)
    - Result: 1
  - **Case 3:** \( (1, 1, 1) \)
    - Total points: \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \) (odd)
    - Result: -1
  - **Case 4:** \( (1, 1, 2) \)
    - Total points: \( 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \) (even)
    - \( p3 \leq p1 + p2 \): False
    - Result: -1
  - **Case 5:** \( (3, 3, 3) \)
    - Total points: \( 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \) (odd)
    - Result: -1
  - **Case 6:** \( (3, 4, 5) \)
    - Total points: \( 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 \) (even)
    - \( p3 \leq p1 + p2 \): False
    - Result: -1
  - **Case 7:** \( (1, 1, 10) \)
    - Total points: \( 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 \) (even)
    - \( p3 \leq p1 + p2 \): False
    - Result: -1

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or return -1 if the scores are inconsistent. The original assessment correctly identified the logic and the edge cases handled properly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
