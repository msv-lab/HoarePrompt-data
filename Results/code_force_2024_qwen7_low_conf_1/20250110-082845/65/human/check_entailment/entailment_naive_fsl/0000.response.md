Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to check whether the distribution of points among the players is consistent with the rules of the game. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 0`, and `p3 = 0`, the output is `0` which is correct.
   - **Case 2**: When `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 1`, the output is `1` which is correct.
   - **Case 3**: When `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 1`, the output is `-1` which is correct because this is impossible with the given scoring system.
   - **Case 4**: When `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`, the output is `2` which is correct.
   - **Case 5**: When `p1 = 3`, `p2 = 3`, and `p3 = 3`, the output is `-1` which is incorrect. This case should be possible with the following breakdown:
     - Player 1 wins against Player 2 and loses to Player 3 (1-2: Win-Lose, 1-3: Lose-Win).
     - Player 2 loses to Player 1 and wins against Player 3 (2-1: Lose-Win, 2-3: Win-Lose).
     - Player 3 wins against both Player 1 and Player 2 (3-1: Win-Win, 3-2: Win-Win).

     In this scenario, Player 1 gets 2 points from the draws and 0 from the losses, Player 2 gets 2 points from the draws and 0 from the losses, and Player 3 gets 4 points from the wins and 2 points from the draws. This configuration is valid but the program returns `-1`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The current logic only checks if the total points are even and if `p3` is not greater than `p1 + p2`. However, it does not consider the specific distribution of points which can sometimes lead to valid configurations being incorrectly marked as invalid.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to correctly determine if certain score distributions are valid under the given game rules.
