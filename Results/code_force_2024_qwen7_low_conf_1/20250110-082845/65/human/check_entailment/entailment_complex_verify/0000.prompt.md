You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.

    results = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in test_cases:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `results` is a list of integers where each element is either -1 or `max_draws`, `max_draws` is defined as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` if the conditions `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2` are not met, otherwise the element is -1.
    return results
    #`The program returns a list of integers where each element is either -1 or max_draws, with max_draws being defined as min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1) if the conditions total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2 are not met, otherwise the element is -1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \) such that \( 0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 \). It returns a list of integers where each element is either \(-1\) or `max_draws`. Here, `max_draws` is defined as \( \min(p_1, p_3 - p_2) + \min(p_2, p_3 - p_1) \) if the conditions `total_points % 2 != 0` or \( p_3 > p_1 + p_2 \) are not met; otherwise, the element is \(-1\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to check whether the distribution of points among the players is consistent with the rules of the game. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 0`, and `p3 = 0`, the output is `0` which is correct.
   - **Case 2**: When `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 1`, the output is `1` which is correct.
   - **Case 3**: When `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 1`, the output is `-1` which is correct because this is impossible with the given scoring system.
   - **Case 4**: When `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`, the output is `2` which is correct.
   - **Case 5**: When `p1 = 3`, `p2 = 3`, and `p3 = 3`, the output is `-1` which is incorrect. This case should be possible with the following breakdown:
     - Player 1 wins against Player 2 and loses to Player 3 (1-2: Win-Lose, 1-3: Lose-Win).
     - Player 2 loses to Player 1 and wins against Player 3 (2-1: Lose-Win, 2-3: Win-Lose).
     - Player 3 wins against both Player 1 and Player 2 (3-1: Win-Win, 3-2: Win-Win).

     In this scenario, Player 1 gets 2 points from the draws and 0 from the losses, Player 2 gets 2 points from the draws and 0 from the losses, and Player 3 gets 4 points from the wins and 2 points from the draws. This configuration is valid but the program returns `-1`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The current logic only checks if the total points are even and if `p3` is not greater than `p1 + p2`. However, it does not consider the specific distribution of points which can sometimes lead to valid configurations being incorrectly marked as invalid.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to correctly determine if certain score distributions are valid under the given game rules.
