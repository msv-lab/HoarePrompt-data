### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the provided program is correct for the given problem statement. However, upon closer inspection and systematic evaluation, we can identify several issues with the logic used to calculate the maximum number of draws.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Total Points:**
   - The program checks if `total_points % 2 != 0` to determine if the total points are even. This condition is unnecessary and misleading because the total points will always be even. The reason is that every game either results in a win/loss (2 points) or a draw (1 point for each player, totaling 2 points). Hence, the total points should always be even, and this check is redundant.

2. **Incorrect Formula for Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{max\_draws} = \min(p1, p3 - p2) + \min(p2, p3 - p1)
     \]
   - This formula can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Specifically, it doesn't correctly account for the fact that the maximum number of draws should be calculated considering the constraints of the problem. The formula might overestimate the number of draws.

3. **Handling of Invalid Scores:**
   - The program correctly sets the result to `-1` when the conditions `p3 > p1 + p2` are met, which is good. However, the overall logic still has flaws due to the incorrect formula.

Let's analyze the examples given in the problem statement to illustrate these issues:

- **Example 4:** (1, 1, 2)
  - The correct output should be 2 (one game between the first and third player, resulting in one win and one draw).
  - Using the formula, the result is \(\min(1, 2-1) + \min(1, 2-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\), which seems correct. However, let's consider another valid scenario:
    - If there were two draws between the first and third player, the scores would be (1, 1, 2), which matches the requirement.
  - Despite the formula appearing to work here, the overall logic might fail in more complex scenarios.

- **Example 5:** (3, 3, 3)
  - The correct output should be -1 because it's impossible to achieve (3, 3, 3) with the given rules.
  - Using the formula, the result is \(\min(3, 3-3) + \min(3, 3-3) = 0 + 0 = 0\), which is incorrect.

- **Example 7:** (1, 1, 10)
  - The correct output should be -1 because it's impossible to achieve (1, 1, 10) with the given rules.
  - Using the formula, the result is \(\min(1, 10-1) + \min(1, 10-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is incorrect.

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct for the given problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
