### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided code and the original assessment step-by-step using the annotated code and the example cases.

#### Key Points in the Code:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases, each containing three integers representing the scores of three players.
   - These scores are stored in a list of tuples, `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the total points.
   - It then checks if the total points are odd (`total_points % 2 != 0`) or if the highest score is greater than the sum of the other two scores (`p3 > p1 + p2`).
   - If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` and appends this value to the results list.

#### Detailed Analysis of Example Cases:

1. **Case 1: `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 0`, `p3 = 0`**
   - Total points: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (even)
   - No conditions violated.
   - Result: `0` (correct)

2. **Case 2: `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 1`**
   - Total points: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even)
   - No conditions violated.
   - Result: `1` (correct)

3. **Case 3: `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 1`**
   - Total points: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (odd)
   - Condition violated.
   - Result: `-1` (correct)

4. **Case 4: `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 2`**
   - Total points: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
   - No conditions violated.
   - Result: `2` (correct)

5. **Case 5: `p1 = 3`, `p2 = 3`, `p3 = 3`**
   - Total points: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (odd)
   - Condition violated.
   - Result: `-1` (incorrect according to the original assessment, but let's verify the logic).

To verify Case 5, we need to check if the distribution of points is possible:
- Player 1: 3 points
- Player 2: 3 points
- Player 3: 3 points

We can achieve this with the following scenarios:
- Player 1 vs Player 2: Draw (1 point each)
- Player 1 vs Player 3: Draw (1 point each)
- Player 2 vs Player 3: Draw (1 point each)

This gives:
- Player 1: 2 points (draws) + 1 point (loss) = 3 points
- Player 2: 2 points (draws) + 1 point (loss) = 3 points
- Player 3: 2 points (draws) + 1 point (win) = 3 points

This configuration is valid, so the result `-1` is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment identified the issue in Case 5 correctly. The program fails to recognize valid configurations due to its simplified logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly and fails to recognize valid configurations, as demonstrated by Case 5.
