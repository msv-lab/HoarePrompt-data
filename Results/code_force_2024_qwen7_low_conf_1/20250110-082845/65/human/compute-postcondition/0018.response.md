The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The `test_cases` and `total_points` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is in the `results` list.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least one more list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `results` is updated to include `-1`.**
