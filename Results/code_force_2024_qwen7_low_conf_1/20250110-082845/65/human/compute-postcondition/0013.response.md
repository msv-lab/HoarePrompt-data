Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must have at least two lists, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`. If `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, `results` is a list containing `-1`. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged and now contains an additional element which is `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)` if applicable.***
