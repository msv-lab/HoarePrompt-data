The code assigns `max_draws` the value of `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. This calculation depends on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. However, since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `max_draws`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least one more list, `total_points` is updated to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`, if `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, then `results` includes `-1`, otherwise `results` does not include `-1`.**
