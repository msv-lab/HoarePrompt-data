Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must have at least one list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. After the execution of the if-else block, if `total_points` is not divisible by 2 or `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `results` is a list containing `-1`. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged.***
