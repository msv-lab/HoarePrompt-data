The code initializes the variable `max_draws` with the value of `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`. This means that `max_draws` is calculated based on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Since `max_draws` is calculated from the existing values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and no other changes are made to the variables in the initial state, the only new information we get is the value of `max_draws`. The initial conditions about `total_points` and the content of `results` remain unchanged unless `max_draws` affects them, but since the condition checks in the initial state are not met (no change to `total_points` or `results`), the values of `total_points` and `results` stay the same.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least two lists, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `results` is a list containing `-1` if `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, otherwise `results` remains unchanged and now contains an additional element which is `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`.**
