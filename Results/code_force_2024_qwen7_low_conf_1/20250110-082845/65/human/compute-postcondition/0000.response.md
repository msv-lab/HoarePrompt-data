The given code initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. After executing the line `results = []`, the variable `results` is now an empty list, but the `test_cases` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30; `results` is an empty list**
