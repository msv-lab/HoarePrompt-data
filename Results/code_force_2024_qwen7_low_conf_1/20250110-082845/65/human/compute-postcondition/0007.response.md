The code assigns a value to `max_draws` based on the minimum values between `p1` and `p3 - p2`, and between `p2` and `p3 - p1`. The values of `test_cases`, `total_points`, `results`, and other variables are not affected. 

The calculation for `max_draws` is specific to the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. However, without specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can only express `max_draws` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least one list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `results` is a list containing `-1` if `total_points` is not divisible by 2 or `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, otherwise `results` remains unchanged, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**
