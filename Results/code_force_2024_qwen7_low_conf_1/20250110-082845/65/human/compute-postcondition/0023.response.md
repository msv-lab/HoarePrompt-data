Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `results` is a list of integers where each element is either -1 or `max_draws`, `max_draws` is defined as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` if the conditions `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2` are not met, otherwise the element is -1.**
