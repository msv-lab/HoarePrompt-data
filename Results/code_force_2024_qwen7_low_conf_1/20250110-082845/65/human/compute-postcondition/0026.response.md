Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \) such that \( 0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 \). It returns a list of integers where each element is either \(-1\) or `max_draws`. Here, `max_draws` is defined as \( \min(p_1, p_3 - p_2) + \min(p_2, p_3 - p_1) \) if the conditions `total_points % 2 != 0` or \( p_3 > p_1 + p_2 \) are not met; otherwise, the element is \(-1\).**

This function iterates over each inner list in `test_cases`, calculates the total points as the sum of \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \), and checks two conditions:
1. If the total points are odd (`total_points % 2 != 0`), or
2. If \( p_3 \) is greater than the sum of \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) (`p3 > p1 + p2`).

If either condition is met, the corresponding element in the result list is set to \(-1\). Otherwise, it calculates `max_draws` using the formula \( \min(p_1, p_3 - p_2) + \min(p_2, p_3 - p_1) \) and appends this value to the result list.

The function handles all the specified edge cases and ensures that the conditions are checked before calculating `max_draws`.
