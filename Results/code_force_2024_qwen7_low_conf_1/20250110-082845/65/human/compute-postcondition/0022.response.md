The code appends the value of `max_draws` to the `results` list. The value of `max_draws` is defined as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. The condition for including `-1` in `results` is `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`. Since this condition is not explicitly evaluated in the given code, we cannot determine if `-1` is included or not without additional information. However, the code itself only appends `max_draws` to `results`.

Given the initial state and the code provided, the output state will be:

- `total_points` is updated to `p1 + p2 + p3`
- `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`
- `results` is updated to include `max_draws`

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least one more list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`, and `results` includes `max_draws`.**
