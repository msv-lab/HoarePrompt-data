The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, \) and \( p_3 \) such that \( 0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 \).

The function returns a list of integers where each element is either \(-1\) or `max_draws`, with `max_draws` being defined as \( \min(p_1, p_3 - p_2) + \min(p_2, p_3 - p_1) \) if the conditions `total_points % 2 != 0` or \( p_3 > p_1 + p_2 \) are not met, otherwise the element is \(-1\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of three integers, and for each test case, compute a value based on specific conditions and return a list of results accordingly.
