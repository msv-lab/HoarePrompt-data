Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `test_cases` must have at least two lists.
- `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`.
- `results` is a list containing `-1` if `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, otherwise `results` remains unchanged and now contains an additional element which is `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`.
- `results` is appended with `max_draws`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `test_cases`.

### Key Points:
1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `test_cases` must have at least one more tuple.
2. Each iteration processes one tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` and updates `results` based on the conditions given.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Condition**: `test_cases` must have at least two lists. This means there are at least two tuples `(p1, p2, p3)` in the list.
2. **After One Iteration**:
   - `total_points` is updated as `p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - If the conditions for `-1` are met, `results` starts with `-1`.
   - Otherwise, `results` appends `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must still have at least one more tuple.
   - After processing the first tuple, we remove it from `test_cases`.

### Adjusted States:
- Since we are moving to the next iteration, we need to ensure `test_cases` has at least one more tuple.
- `total_points` is recalculated for the new tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`.
- `results` is updated based on the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

### Updated State:
- `test_cases` must have at least one more list (one more tuple).
- `total_points` is recalculated as `p1 + p2 + p3` for the new tuple.
- `results` is updated based on the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`test_cases` must have at least one more list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3` for the new tuple, and `results` is updated based on the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.**

This ensures that the loop can continue to the next iteration.
