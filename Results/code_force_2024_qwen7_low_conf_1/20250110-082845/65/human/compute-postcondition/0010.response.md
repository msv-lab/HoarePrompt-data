The code calculates `total_points` as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. This updates the value of `total_points` but does not change the values of `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. The condition for updating `results` is checked based on the new value of `total_points`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. `total_points` is updated to `p1 + p2 + p3`.
2. The condition for `results` to contain `-1` or to add `max_draws` is evaluated based on the new `total_points` value.

Given the initial conditions:
- `results` is a list containing `-1` if `total_points` is not divisible by 2 or `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, otherwise `results` remains unchanged and now contains an additional element which is `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`.

After executing the code, the only change is in the value of `total_points`, and the condition for updating `results` might change based on the new value of `total_points`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least two lists, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `results` is a list containing `-1` if `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is not divisible by 2 or `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, otherwise `results` remains unchanged and now contains an additional element which is `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`**.
