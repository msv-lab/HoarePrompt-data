To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues:

1. **Initial Condition**: The `test_cases` list must have at least one list.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
- `results` is a list containing `-1` if `total_points` is not divisible by 2 or `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, otherwise `results` remains unchanged and now contains an additional element which is `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `test_cases` list must still have at least one tuple left to process. This means that after processing one tuple, there should still be at least one tuple remaining in `test_cases`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `test_cases` must have at least one list.
2. **After One Iteration**: After processing one tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, the `test_cases` list should still have at least one tuple left. 

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this condition:

State: **`test_cases` must have at least two lists, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `results` is a list containing `-1` if `total_points` is not divisible by 2 or `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, otherwise `results` remains unchanged and now contains an additional element which is `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`**.
