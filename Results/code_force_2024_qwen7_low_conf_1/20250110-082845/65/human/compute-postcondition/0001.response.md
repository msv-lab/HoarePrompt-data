State before the loop starts: `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) such that \( 0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 \); `results` is an empty list.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `test_cases`, and in each iteration, it takes a tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` from `test_cases`.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `test_cases`: A list of lists containing triples of integers.
   - `results`: An empty list.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element (list). If `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Variables within the Loop**: Inside the loop, the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned the values from the current tuple in `test_cases`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `test_cases` must have at least one list. Additionally, the loop will assign `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` the values from this list, but since we are only concerned with ensuring the loop executes, the initial state of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` does not need to be explicitly stated here.

**State:**
- **`test_cases` must have at least one list**.

So, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`test_cases` must have at least one list**.
