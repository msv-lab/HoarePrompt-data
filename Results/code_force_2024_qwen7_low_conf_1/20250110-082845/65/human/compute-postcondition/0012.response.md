The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, since no loop context is provided, the `continue` statement does not have any direct impact on the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least two lists, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `results` is a list containing `-1`, `total_points`, and `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)` if applicable.**
