The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. Therefore, all the conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least one list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_points` is not divisible by 2 or the current value of `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `results` is a list containing `-1`.**
