The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. The states of `test_cases`, `total_points`, and `results` are unaffected.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least one more list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `results` includes `-1`**
