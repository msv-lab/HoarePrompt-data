The code `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3` assigns the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to the variable `total_points`. However, the initial values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `total_points`. The output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least one list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`**
