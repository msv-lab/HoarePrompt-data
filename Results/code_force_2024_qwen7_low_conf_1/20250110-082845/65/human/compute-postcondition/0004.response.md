The code appends the value `-1` to the list `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` and the calculation of `total_points` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the list `results`.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least one list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_points` is not divisible by 2 or the current value of `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `results` is a list containing `-1`.**
