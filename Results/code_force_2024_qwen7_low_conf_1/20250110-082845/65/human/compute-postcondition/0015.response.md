The code appends `max_draws` to the `results` list. Given the initial state:

- `test_cases` must have at least two lists
- `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`
- `results` is a list containing `-1` if `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, otherwise `results` remains unchanged and now contains an additional element which is `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`.

After executing the line `results.append(max_draws)`:

- The value of `results` is updated to include `max_draws`.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least two lists, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `results` is a list containing `-1` if `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, otherwise `results` remains unchanged and now contains an additional element which is `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)`; `results` is appended with `max_draws`.**
