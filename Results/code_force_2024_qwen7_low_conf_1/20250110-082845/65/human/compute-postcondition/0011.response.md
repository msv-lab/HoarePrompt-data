The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially a list containing `-1` if `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is not divisible by 2 or `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, appending `-1` does not change its content because the condition for appending `-1` is already satisfied. The `total_points` and `max_draws` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least two lists, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `results` is a list containing `-1`, `total_points`, and `max_draws`, where `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1)` if applicable.**
