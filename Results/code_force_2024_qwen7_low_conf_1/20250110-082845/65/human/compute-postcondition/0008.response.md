`results` is a list that contains `-1` if `total_points` is not divisible by 2 or `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged. `max_draws` is defined as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. The code appends `max_draws` to the `results` list.

Since `results` is a list, appending `max_draws` to it will create a new list with an additional element. The previous state of `results` is maintained except for the addition of `max_draws`.

Output State: **`test_cases` must have at least one list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `results` is a list containing `-1` if `total_points` is not divisible by 2 or `p3` is greater than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, otherwise `results` is unchanged and now contains an additional element which is `max_draws`, `max_draws` is `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**
