The given code snippet is a single print statement that outputs the value of the variable `ans`. Since no operations are performed on any variable inside the code snippet, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `dist` is \((a[0] - a[n-1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \(((a[0] - a[n-1]) \% m * inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is the cumulative sum of \((prob_last * expected_getting_moved \% MOD * expected_time \% MOD) \% MOD\) for all iterations from 0 to `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `inv_m` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`, `inv_2` is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo `MOD`, `inv_3` is the modular multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo `MOD`, and `ans` is within the range 0 to `MOD-1`.**
