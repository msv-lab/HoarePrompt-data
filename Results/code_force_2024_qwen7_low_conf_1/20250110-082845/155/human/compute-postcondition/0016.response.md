Let's break down the problem step-by-step to understand how the states should be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct.
- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\).
- `inv_2` is \(500000000\).
- `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- `tc` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is the second integer from input.
- `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\).
- `ans` is \((dist * inv_m \mod MOD) * (n * inv_2 \mod MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \mod MOD) \mod MOD\) and has been taken modulo `MOD`.
- `n` must be a positive integer.
- `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\).
- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
- `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`.
- `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\).

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again
For the loop to execute again, the value of `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented within the loop body, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

### Adjusting States
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the current value of `i` (let's denote it as `current_i`).
- The condition `i < n` must hold true for the loop to continue.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `current_i + 1`.
- The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Updated States
Since `i` is incremented by 1 and the condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, the updated states will be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `MOD`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`, `tc`, `m`, `inv_m`, `ans`, `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time` remain the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` becomes `current_i + 1`.

### Final State
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct, `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `inv_2` is \(500000000\), `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), `tc` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from input, `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\), `ans` is \((dist * inv_m \mod MOD) * (n * inv_2 \mod MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \mod MOD) \mod MOD\) and has been taken modulo `MOD`, `n` must be a positive integer, `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\), `i` is `current_i + 1`**.
