The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, the function also accepts `n` and `m` as integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` as a list of `n` integers where each \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all \(a_i\)'s are pairwise distinct.

The output of the function depends on the internal logic, but based on the provided constraints, the function likely processes these inputs in some way. However, since the specific output is not detailed, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `t`, along with `n`, `m`, and a list `a` of integers, where `t` indicates the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `a` follow the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, and for each test case within `t`, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers.**
