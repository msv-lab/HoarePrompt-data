The code snippet reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `input().split()`, and then converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This affects the variables `n` and `m`. However, the values of the other variables (`i`, `dist`, `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, `expected_time`, `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not referenced or modified within the given code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `dist` is \((a[0] - a[n-1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is the sum of \((dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)\) for each iteration of the loop, modulo \(MOD\); `ans` is printed.**
