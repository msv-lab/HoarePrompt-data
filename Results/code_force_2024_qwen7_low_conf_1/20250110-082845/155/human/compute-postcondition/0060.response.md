Let's analyze the given problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `dist` is \((a[0] - a[n-1]) \% m\)
   - `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\)
   - `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\)
   - `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\)
   - `ans` is the sum of \((dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)\) for each iteration of the loop, modulo \(MOD\)
   - `ans` is printed

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(tc):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

From the for loop statement, we know that the loop will execute `tc` times. The loop does not depend on any variables like `i` or `n` within the loop itself, but rather it is controlled by the number of iterations specified by `tc`.

Since the loop body is omitted, we can infer that the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `dist` is \((a[0] - a[n-1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is the sum of \((dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)\) for each iteration of the loop, modulo \(MOD\); `ans` is printed.**
