The code calculates `inv_3` using the formula `pow(3, MOD - 2, MOD)`. Given that `MOD` is `10^9 + 7`, this computes the modular multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo `10^9 + 7`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `inv_2`) remain unchanged.

The calculation for `inv_3` can be broken down as follows:
- `inv_3` is the value of `3^(10^9 + 6) mod (10^9 + 7)`.

Since the exact numerical value of `inv_3` is derived from a large exponentiation operation, we will leave it in its computed form rather than expanding it fully.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m and all a_i's are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is 10^9 + 7; `inv_2` is 500000000; `inv_3` is 3^(10^9 + 6) mod (10^9 + 7)**
