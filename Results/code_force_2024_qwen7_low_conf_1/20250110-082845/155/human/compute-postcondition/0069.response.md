The code updates the value of `expected_time` to \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\). The value of `dist` is \((a[1] - a[0]) \% m\), and `inv_3` is the modular multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo `MOD`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `dist` is \((a[1] - a[0]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((a[1] - a[0]) \% m * inv_m \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `inv_m` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`, `inv_2` is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo `MOD`, `inv_3` is the modular multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo `MOD`**
