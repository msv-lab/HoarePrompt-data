The code assigns the value of `n * inv_2 % MOD` to `expected_getting_moved`. The value of `n` is greater than 3, and all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `dist` is `(a[4] - a[3]) % m`, `prob_last` is `(a[4] - a[3]) % m * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`, `ans` is `ans % MOD`, `n` must be greater than 3**
