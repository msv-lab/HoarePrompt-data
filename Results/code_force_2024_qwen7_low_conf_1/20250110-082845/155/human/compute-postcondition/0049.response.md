`ans` is updated by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`. The value of `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\), the value of `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), and the value of `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\). Therefore, the new value of `ans` is the current value of `ans` plus the product of these three values.

Let's express this mathematically:
- Current `ans`: \((a[2 \% n] - a[1]) \% m\)
- `prob_last`: \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\)
- `expected_getting_moved`: \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\)
- `expected_time`: \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\)

The updated `ans` is:
\[ ans \leftarrow (ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD \]

Since we are updating `ans`, the final output state will include the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is \((a[2 \% n] - a[1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is \((ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD\)**
