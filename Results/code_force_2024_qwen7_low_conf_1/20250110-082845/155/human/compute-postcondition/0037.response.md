Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\).
- `inv_2` is \(500000000\).
- `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- `tc` must be greater than 1.
- `m` is the second integer from input.
- `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\).
- `ans` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from input.
- `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\).
- `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\).
- `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \mod MOD\).
- `expected_time` is \(((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3) \mod MOD\).

### For Loop:
The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs as long as `i < n`.
- For each iteration, `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until `i` reaches `n-1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` must start from 0 and be less than `n` for the loop to execute correctly.
- The variable `n` must be a positive integer and at least 1 for the loop to run.

Given the above analysis, we need to adjust the following states for the loop to execute:

- `i` should start from 0.
- `n` should be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
