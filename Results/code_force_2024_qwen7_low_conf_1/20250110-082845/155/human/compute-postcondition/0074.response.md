The code `prob_last = dist * inv_m % MOD` calculates `prob_last` by multiplying `dist` with `inv_m` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The values of `i`, `dist`, `inv_m`, and `MOD` are as follows in the initial state:

- `i` is 2
- `dist` is `(a[2 % n] - a[1]) % m`

Let's calculate the value of `dist` first since it depends on `a` and `n`, which are not specified. We will keep it in its current form because we don't have the actual values of `a` and `n`.

After executing the code, `prob_last` is assigned the value of `dist * inv_m % MOD`. The values of `i` and `dist` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `dist` is `(a[2 % n] - a[1]) % m`; `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`**
