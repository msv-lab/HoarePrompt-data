The code assigns a value to `expected_getting_moved`, but this assignment does not depend on any existing variables and only uses constants or previously defined variables (`n` and `inv_2`). The values of `i`, `dist`, and `prob_last` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `dist` is `(a[2 % n] - a[1]) % m`; `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`; `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`**
