The code updates the value of `prob_last` to be the product of `dist` and `inv_m` modulo `MOD`. No other variables are affected. 

Given:
- `dist` is defined as \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\)
- `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\)

After the code executes, the value of `prob_last` is updated to \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\); `inv_2` is \(500000000\); `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\); `tc` must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from input; `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\); `n` must be a positive integer; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\); `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\); `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \mod MOD\); `expected_time` is \(((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3) \mod MOD\); `i` is `current_i + 2`; `ans` is updated by the equation above; `ans` is `ans % MOD.`**
