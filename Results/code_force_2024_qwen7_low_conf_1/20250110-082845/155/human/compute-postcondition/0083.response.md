The code snippet updates the value of `expected_time` using the formula `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`. The values of `m`, `dist`, and `inv_3` remain unchanged from their initial state, while `expected_time` is recalculated.

- The initial value of `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`.
- After executing the line of code, `expected_time` is updated to the same expression since the right-hand side of the equation does not change.

Therefore, the value of `expected_time` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `dist` is `(a[4] - a[3]) % m`, `prob_last` is `(a[4] - a[3]) % m * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`, `ans` is `ans % MOD`, `n` must be greater than 3**
