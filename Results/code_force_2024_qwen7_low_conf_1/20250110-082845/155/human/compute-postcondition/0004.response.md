According to the code, the loop can execute if `tc` is at least 1. The current state of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `MOD`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`, and `tc` does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `tc` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m and all a_i's are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is 10^9 + 7; `inv_2` is 500000000; `inv_3` is 3^(10^9 + 6) mod (10^9 + 7); `tc` must be greater than 0**
