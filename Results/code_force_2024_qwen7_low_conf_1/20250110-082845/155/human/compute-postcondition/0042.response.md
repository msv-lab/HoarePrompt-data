The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`, all modulo `MOD`. Let's break down the values:

- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`
- `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`
- `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\)

Thus, the updated value of `ans` is:
\[ ans += (dist * inv_m \% MOD) \times (n * inv_2 \% MOD) \times ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD) \% MOD \]

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `inv_m`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`, and `MOD`, we keep these in the expression.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) \% m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m \% MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 \% MOD`, `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is `ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD) \% MOD`**
