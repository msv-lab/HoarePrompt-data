The code updates the value of `prob_last` to be `dist * inv_m % MOD`. This means that `prob_last` is now the result of the calculation `dist * inv_m % MOD`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `prob_last` is updated to `dist * inv_m % MOD`
- All other variables remain in their initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct, `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `inv_2` is \(500000000\), `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), `tc` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from input, `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\), `ans` is \((dist * inv_m \mod MOD) * (n * inv_2 \mod MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \mod MOD) \mod MOD\), `n` must be a positive integer, `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\), and `i` is `current_i + 1`**
