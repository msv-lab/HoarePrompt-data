`prob_last` is assigned the value `dist * inv_m % MOD`. The value of `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, and `inv_m` and `MOD` are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code. The variables `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`
- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`**
