Let's analyze the given information and the task step-by-step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct.
   - `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `inv_2` is \(500000000\).
   - `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `m` is the second integer from input.
   - `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\).
   - `ans` is the sum of \((dist \times inv_m \mod MOD) \times (n \times inv_2 \mod MOD) \times ((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \mod MOD) \mod MOD\) for all valid `i` in the range of `n`.
   - `n` is the first integer from input.
   - Where `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \mod MOD\), `expected_time` is \(((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3) \mod MOD\).
   - The value of `ans` is printed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for _ in range(tc):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `tc` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be decremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\); `inv_2` is \(500000000\); `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\); `tc` must be greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from input; `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\); `ans` is the sum of \((dist \times inv_m \mod MOD) \times (n \times inv_2 \mod MOD) \times ((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \mod MOD) \mod MOD\) for all valid `i` in the range of `n`; `n` is the first integer from input; where `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \mod MOD\), `expected_time` is \(((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3) \mod MOD\); the value of `ans` is printed.**
