According to the given for loop and the current state, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop condition is `i < n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- `dist` is `(a[2 % n] - a[1]) % m`.
- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
- `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`.
- `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`.
- `ans` is `ans % MOD`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

To ensure the loop can continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables (`dist`, `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, `expected_time`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is 3, `dist` is `(a[2 % n] - a[1]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`, `ans` is `ans % MOD`, `n` must be greater than 3**
