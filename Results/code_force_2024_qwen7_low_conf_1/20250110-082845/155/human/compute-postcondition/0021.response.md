The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`, all modulo `MOD`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\)
- `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \mod MOD\)
- `expected_time` is \(((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3) \mod MOD\)

So, the updated `ans` is calculated as follows:
\[ ans = ans + ((dist \times inv_m \mod MOD) \times (n \times inv_2 \mod MOD) \times (((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \mod MOD)) \mod MOD \]

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`. All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\); `inv_2` is \(500000000\); `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\); `tc` must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from input; `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\); `n` must be a positive integer; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\); `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\); `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \mod MOD\); `expected_time` is \(((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3) \mod MOD\); `i` is `current_i + 1`; `ans` is updated by the equation above.**
