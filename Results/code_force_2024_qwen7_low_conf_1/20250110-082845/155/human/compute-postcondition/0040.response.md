The code assigns `n * inv_2 % MOD` to the variable `expected_getting_moved`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `inv_2` is a constant, and `MOD` is also a constant, `expected_getting_moved` will be a specific value. However, without knowing the exact values of `inv_2` and `MOD`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `expected_getting_moved`. The values of `i`, `n`, `dist`, and `prob_last` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`**
