The code snippet defines a constant `MOD` which is set to \(10^9 + 7\). This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or `a`. The values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of the constant `MOD`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m and all a_i's are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is 10^9 + 7.**
