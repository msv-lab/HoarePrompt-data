Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\); `inv_2` is \(500000000\); `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\); `tc` is the number of times the loop has executed; `m` is the last integer read from input; `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\); `ans` is the cumulative sum of \((dist \times inv_m \mod MOD) \times (n \times inv_2 \mod MOD) \times ((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \mod MOD) \mod MOD\) for all iterations from 0 to `n-1`, modulo `MOD`; `n` is the last integer read from input; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \(((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3) \mod MOD\); `ans` is within the range 0 to `MOD-1`.**
