Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `dist` is \((a[0] - a[n-1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is the sum of \((dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)\) for each iteration of the loop, modulo \(MOD\).**
