The code assigns `expected_getting_moved` the value of `n * inv_2 % MOD`. This calculation does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `expected_getting_moved` is calculated using the existing values of `n` and `inv_2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct, `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\), `inv_2` is \(500000000\), `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), `tc` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from input, `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\), `ans` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer, `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`**
