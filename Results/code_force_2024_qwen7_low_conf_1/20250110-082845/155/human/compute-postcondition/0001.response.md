The code assigns the value `(MOD + 1) // 2` to the variable `inv_2`. Given that `MOD` is `10^9 + 7`, the value of `inv_2` will be `(10^9 + 7 + 1) // 2 = 500000000`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m and all a_i's are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is 10^9 + 7; `inv_2` is 500000000**
