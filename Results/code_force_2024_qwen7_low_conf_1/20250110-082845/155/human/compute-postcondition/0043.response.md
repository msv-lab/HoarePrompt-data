The code `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be `ans` modulo `MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) \% m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m \% MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 \% MOD`, `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is `(ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) \% m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m \% MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 \% MOD`, `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is `(ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD**.
