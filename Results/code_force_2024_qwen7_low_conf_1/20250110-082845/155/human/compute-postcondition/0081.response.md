The code `prob_last = dist * inv_m % MOD` updates the value of `prob_last` by calculating `dist * inv_m % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `dist` is initially `(a[4] - a[3]) % m`, `inv_m` is the modular inverse of `m`, and `MOD` is a constant, the new value of `prob_last` is `(a[4] - a[3]) % m * inv_m % MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `dist` is `(a[4] - a[3]) % m`, `prob_last` is `(a[4] - a[3]) % m * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`, `ans` is `ans % MOD`, `n` must be greater than 3**
