The code snippet updates the value of `expected_time` using the formula \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \mod MOD\). The variables `m`, `inv_3`, `MOD`, `dist`, and `inv_m` are already defined in the initial state, and they are used in this calculation.

Let's break down the steps:

1. `expected_time` is updated to \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \mod MOD\).
2. The values of `m`, `inv_3`, `MOD`, `dist`, and `inv_m` remain unchanged.
3. The value of `expected_time` is now calculated based on the given formula.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct
- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\)
- `inv_2` is \(500000000\)
- `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\)
- `tc` must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer from input
- `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\)
- `ans` is \((dist * inv_m \mod MOD) * (n * inv_2 \mod MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \mod MOD) \mod MOD\)
- `n` must be a positive integer
- `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\)
- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`
- `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`
- `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \mod MOD\)
- `i` is `current_i + 1`
