The code snippet does not change the value of `expected_time`. It simply reassigns the value of `expected_time` using the same formula that was already present in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `expected_time` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `dist` is \((a[3 \% n] - a[2]) \% m\); `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\); `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\); `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\); `ans` is \(((ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD**
