The code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `m` using `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)` and assigns it to `inv_m`. This operation does not change the values of the other variables, but it updates `inv_m` with its calculated value.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `m` is an integer read from input
- `dist` is \((a[0] - a[n-1]) \% m\)
- `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\)
- `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\)
- `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\)
- `ans` is the sum of \((dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)\) for each iteration of the loop, modulo \(MOD\)
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input

After executing the line `inv_m = pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`, the value of `inv_m` is updated, but the values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `dist` is \((a[0] - a[n-1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is the sum of \((dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)\) for each iteration of the loop, modulo \(MOD\); `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `inv_m` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`.**
