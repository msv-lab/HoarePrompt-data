The code calculates the modular inverse of `m` using the formula `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`. This means that `inv_m` is assigned the value of `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

- `inv_m` is updated to the value of `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `MOD`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`, `tc`, `n`, and `m`) retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m and all a_i's are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is 10^9 + 7; `inv_2` is 500000000; `inv_3` is 3^(10^9 + 6) mod (10^9 + 7); `tc` must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from input; `m` is the second integer from input; `inv_m` is m^(MOD - 2) mod MOD**
