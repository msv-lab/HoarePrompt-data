The code snippet updates the value of `prob_last` to be equal to `dist * inv_m % MOD`. Since this is a direct assignment, the value of `prob_last` is now updated to match the right-hand side of the equation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is \((a[2 \% n] - a[1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 \% MOD`, `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is \((ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD\)**
