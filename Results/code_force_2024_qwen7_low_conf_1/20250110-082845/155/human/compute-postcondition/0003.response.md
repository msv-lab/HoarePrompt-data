`tc` is assigned the value `int(input())`. This means we are now waiting for an input to assign to `tc`, while the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `MOD`, `inv_2`, and `inv_3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m and all a_i's are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is 10^9 + 7; `inv_2` is 500000000; `inv_3` is 3^(10^9 + 6) mod (10^9 + 7); `tc` is an input integer**
