Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `m` is an integer read from input
- `dist` is \((a[0] - a[n-1]) \% m\)
- `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\)
- `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\)
- `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\)
- `ans` is 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input
- `inv_m` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`

### For Loop
The for loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop will start with `i = 0` and continue until `i < n`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`.

Given that `i` is initially set to `n - 1`, we need to determine how many iterations the loop will perform:
- When `i` is `n - 1`, the condition `i < n` is already false, so the loop will not execute at all.

### Adjusting the States
To make the loop execute, `i` must start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n - 1`.

### Adjusted States
- We need to change `i` to start at 0 instead of `n - 1`.
- The variable `i` will be incremented within the loop body, so it will eventually reach `n - 1`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0 instead of `n - 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `dist` is \((a[0] - a[n-1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `inv_m` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `m` modulo `MOD`**.
