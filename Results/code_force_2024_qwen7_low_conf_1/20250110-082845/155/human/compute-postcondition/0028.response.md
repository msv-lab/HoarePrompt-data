`ans` is updated by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`, all taken modulo `MOD`. Specifically, `ans` is updated by the equation:

\[ ans \leftarrow (ans + (prob_last \times expected_getting_moved \times expected_time) \% MOD) \% MOD \]

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct
- `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\)
- `inv_2` is \(500000000\)
- `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\)
- `tc` must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer from input
- `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\)
- `n` must be a positive integer
- `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\)
- `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\)
- `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times 500000000 \mod (10^9 + 7)\)
- `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\)
- `i` is `current_i + 2`

The code updates `ans` but does not change the values of the other variables. Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\) and all `a_i`'s are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\); `inv_2` is \(500000000\); `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\); `tc` must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from input; `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\); `n` must be a positive integer; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\); `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\); `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times 500000000 \mod (10^9 + 7)\); `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\); `i` is `current_i + 2`; `ans` is updated by the equation above; `ans` is `ans \% MOD.`**
