The code calculates `expected_time` using the formula `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`. The variables `i`, `dist`, `prob_last`, and `expected_getting_moved` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `m * m` is a constant.
- `dist * dist` is the square of `dist`.
- The result is then multiplied by `inv_3` and taken modulo `MOD`.

So, the updated state will include the new value of `expected_time` and keep the values of `i`, `dist`, `prob_last`, and `expected_getting_moved` as they were initially.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `dist` is `(a[2 % n] - a[1]) % m`; `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`; `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`; `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`**
