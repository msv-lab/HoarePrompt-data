`n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. The input is expected to be two integers, and these values replace the previous values of `n` and `m`. The values of `t`, `a`, `MOD`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`, and `tc` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m and all a_i's are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is 10^9 + 7; `inv_2` is 500000000; `inv_3` is 3^(10^9 + 6) mod (10^9 + 7); `tc` must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from input; `m` is the second integer from input**
