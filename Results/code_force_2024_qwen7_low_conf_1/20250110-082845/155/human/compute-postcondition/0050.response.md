The code snippet `ans %= MOD` performs the modulo operation on the variable `ans`. This operation updates the value of `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. Since `ans` was defined as `(ans + (dist * inv_m % MOD) * (n * inv_2 % MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD)) % MOD`, the modulo operation is already applied to the right-hand side of the equation, so the overall value of `ans` remains unchanged after this operation.

Therefore, the values of all other variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is \((a[2 \% n] - a[1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is \((ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD\)**
