The code snippet `expected_getting_moved = n * inv_2 % MOD` assigns the value of `n * inv_2 % MOD` to the variable `expected_getting_moved`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `dist` is \((a[2 \% n] - a[1]) \% m\)
- `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\)
- `expected_getting_moved` is now `n * inv_2 \% MOD`
- `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\)
- `ans` is \((ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD\)

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is \((a[2 \% n] - a[1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 \% MOD`, `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is \((ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD\)**
