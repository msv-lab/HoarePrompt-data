The code `expected_getting_moved = n * inv_2 % MOD` updates the value of `expected_getting_moved`. Initially, `expected_getting_moved` is defined as \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\). After executing this line, `expected_getting_moved` is re-assigned to the same expression, meaning its value remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `dist` is \((a[3 \% n] - a[2]) \% m\); `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m) \% MOD\); `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\); `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\); `ans` is \(((ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD**
