The code `a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))` impacts the program by taking two space-separated integers as input (which determine `n` and `m`), splitting the input into a list of strings, converting each string to an integer, and then sorting this list of integers. The original list `a` is updated to this sorted list. The values of `t`, `MOD`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`, `tc`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m and all a_i's are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is 10^9 + 7; `inv_2` is 500000000; `inv_3` is 3^(10^9 + 6) mod (10^9 + 7); `tc` must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from input; `m` is the second integer from input**
