Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) \% m`
   - `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m \% MOD`
   - `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 \% MOD`
   - `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\)
   - `ans` is `(ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1.

4. **States Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `dist`, `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, `expected_time`, and `ans` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are mentioned.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `dist` remains as `(a[1] - a[0]) \% m`.
   - `prob_last` remains as `dist * inv_m \% MOD`.
   - `expected_getting_moved` remains as `n * inv_2 \% MOD`.
   - `expected_time` remains as \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\).
   - `ans` remains as `(ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) \% m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m \% MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 \% MOD`, `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is `(ans + (dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD**.
