The code snippet updates the value of `inv_m` using the formula \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\). Given the initial state, the value of `inv_m` is now specifically calculated and stored.

- `inv_m` is updated to \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\).

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `MOD` is \(10^9 + 7\); `inv_2` is \(500000000\); `inv_3` is \(3^{(10^9 + 6)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\); `tc` must be greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from input; `inv_m` is \(m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD\); `ans` is the sum of \((dist \times inv_m \mod MOD) \times (n \times inv_2 \mod MOD) \times ((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3 \mod MOD) \mod MOD\) for all valid `i` in the range of `n`; `n` is the first integer from input; where `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is \((dist \times inv_m) \% MOD\), `expected_getting_moved` is \(n \times inv_2 \mod MOD\), `expected_time` is \(((m \times m - dist \times dist) \times inv_3) \mod MOD\)**
