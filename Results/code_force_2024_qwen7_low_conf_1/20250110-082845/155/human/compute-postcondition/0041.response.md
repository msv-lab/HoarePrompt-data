The code assigns a value to `expected_time` based on the given formula. The values of `i`, `n`, `dist`, `prob_last`, and `expected_getting_moved` remain unchanged. The new value of `expected_time` is calculated as \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\).

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\)**
