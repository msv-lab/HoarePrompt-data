Reasoning:  
The provided program appears to be designed to solve the given problem accurately. Here's a breakdown of the steps and checks:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes constants such as `MOD`, `inv_2`, and `inv_3` which are used throughout the computation. These constants are derived from the problem constraints and help manage large numbers using modular arithmetic.

2. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `tc`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers representing the initial positions of the balls.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The list `a` is sorted, which ensures that the distance calculations between consecutive elements are handled correctly, considering the circular nature of the baskets.
   - For each element in the list `a`, the program computes the distance `dist` between consecutive elements, considering the circular order.
   - Probabilities and expected values are calculated based on these distances. The formula for `prob_last` represents the probability that a ball will be last in the sequence after moving. `expected_getting_moved` represents the expected number of balls that need to move, and `expected_time` is the expected time to reduce the number of balls by one.
   - The result for each ball movement is summed up to get the total expected time for that test case.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: All operations are performed under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers and ensure results fit within standard integer limits.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program assumes valid input constraints are met, such as \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\). The sorting of the list `a` ensures that the distance calculations are handled correctly, even when considering the circular nature of the baskets.

Given that the program follows the logic outlined in the problem statement and handles the required computations correctly, the provided implementation appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
