### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and its function summary in detail to ensure it correctly implements the problem statement.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Constants**:
   - `MOD = 10^9 + 7` ensures that all calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `inv_2` and `inv_3` are modular inverses calculated correctly. `inv_2` is \((10^9 + 7 + 1) / 2\) and `inv_3` is \(3^{10^9 + 6} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Reading Input**:
   - `tc`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read, and the positions of the balls are stored in `a`.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `inv_m`: The modular inverse of `m` is calculated using `pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)`. This ensures that division in the modulo context is handled correctly.
   - `ans`: Accumulates the expected time for each ball.
   - The loop iterates over each ball:
     - `dist`: The distance between consecutive balls in the circular arrangement, computed using `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`.
     - `prob_last`: The probability of the last ball being the ball selected, which is `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
     - `expected_getting_moved`: The expected time for a ball to get moved, which is `n * inv_2 % MOD`.
     - `expected_time`: The contribution to the total expected time, computed as `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time` modulo `MOD`.

#### Verification of Key Points:

1. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program uses `% MOD` extensively, ensuring that all intermediate results stay within the bounds of \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance calculation `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m` correctly handles the circular nature of the baskets.

3. **Probabilities and Expectations**:
   - The formulas for `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time` are derived correctly from the problem's requirements.

4. **Modular Inverses**:
   - The use of modular inverses (`inv_2` and `inv_3`) is appropriate for division in modular arithmetic.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The final result is printed correctly in the required format.

Given the detailed analysis and the adherence to the problem constraints, the provided program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the necessary calculations accurately.

Final: **True**
