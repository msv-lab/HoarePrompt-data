The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `x` and `mod`. Here, `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < 10^9 + 7\) and is coprime with \(10^9 + 7\), and `mod` is fixed at \(10^9 + 7\). The function computes and returns the result of \(pow(x, 10^9 + 6, 10^9 + 7)\). This computation effectively finds the modular multiplicative inverse of `x` raised to the power of \(10^9 + 6\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function always returns a value within the range defined by the modulus \(10^9 + 7\).
