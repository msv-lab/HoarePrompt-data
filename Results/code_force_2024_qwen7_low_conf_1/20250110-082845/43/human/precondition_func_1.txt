`tree` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, where keys are node indices (ranging from 1 to n) and values are lists of neighboring nodes. `node` is an integer representing the current node being processed, and `parent` is an integer representing the parent node of the current node in the traversal. `student_types` is a list of strings of length n, where each string represents the type of student in the corresponding room (either 'P', 'S', or 'C').
