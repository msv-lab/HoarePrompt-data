`S` is assigned the value of `input()`, which reads a string from the input. The values of `dp1[0]`, `dp2[0]`, `n`, and `fa` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value; `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value; `n` is an input integer; `fa` is a list starting with `-1` followed by the integers read from the input; `S` is a string read from the input**
