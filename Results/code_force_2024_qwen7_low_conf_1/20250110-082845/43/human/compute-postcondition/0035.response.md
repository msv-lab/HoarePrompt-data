Postcondition: ***`S[i]` is a character, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', else unchanged, `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', else unchanged, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. If `p == -1`, no updates are made to `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]`.***
