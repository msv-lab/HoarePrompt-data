The code snippet updates `dp2[p]` by adding the minimum value between `dp1[i] + 1` and `dp2[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `S[i]` is a character
- `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', else unchanged
- `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', else unchanged
- `p` is `fa[i] - 1`
- `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`

The impact on the variables is as follows:

1. `dp1[p]` is already updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`.
2. `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

- `S[i]` is a character
- `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', else unchanged
- `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', else unchanged
- `p` is `fa[i] - 1`
- `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`
- `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`

Output State: **`S[i]` is a character, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'S', else unchanged, `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', else unchanged, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])**
