The code `p = fa[i] - 1` assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to the variable `p`. The values of `S[i]`, `dp1[i]`, and `dp2[i]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is in the variable `p`.

Output State: **`S[i]` is a character. If `S[i]` is 'S', then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`. If `S[i]` is not 'S', then `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is 'P', and remains unchanged otherwise; `p` is `fa[i] - 1`.**
