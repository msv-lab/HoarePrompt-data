The code initializes two lists `dp1` and `dp2` with zeros of length `n + 1`. This means that each list will contain `n + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`.

- `dp1` and `dp2` are now `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (with `n + 1` elements).
- `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` retain their original values (either `float('inf')` or a finite value) because they are not reassigned in this step.
- `n`, `fa`, and `S` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value; `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value; `n` is an input integer; `fa` is a list starting with `-1` followed by the integers read from the input; `S` is a string read from the input; `dp1` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `0`; `dp2` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `0`.**
