Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\)
- `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `S`
- `p` is `fa[i] - 1`

The conditions for updating `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are as follows:
- If `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Continue:**
   - The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` in steps of `-1`.
   - Therefore, the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. **Identify the Variables and Their States:**
   - `n`: Must be between 2 and \(10^5\).
   - `i`: Must be an index within the bounds of the list `S`, which means `0 <= i < n`.
   - `p`: Is calculated as `fa[i] - 1`.

3. **Determine the New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k < n`).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must now be `k - 1` (since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time).

4. **Update the State:**
   - Since `i` decreases by 1, the new value of `i` will be `k - 1`.
   - The value of `p` will change based on `fa[i] - 1`, but we do not need to explicitly update it unless `p` becomes `-1` in the next iteration, which does not affect the condition for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:

At the start of the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be decreased by 1, making it `k - 1`. The other variables (`n` and `p`) remain unchanged for the loop condition.

**State:**
- `n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\)
- `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `S`, specifically `i = k - 1` where `0 <= k < n`
- `p` is `fa[i] - 1`

**Final State:**
State: **`n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\), `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `S`, specifically `i = k - 1` where `0 <= k < n`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`**
