Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, for each test case: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, fa is a list of integers where fa[i] (0-indexed) is the parent of node i+1 in the tree, S is a string of length n consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C', dp1 and dp2 are lists of integers where dp1[i] represents the minimum cost to reach a leaf node starting from node i (considering only paths through nodes marked 'P' or 'S'), and dp2[i] represents the same but considering only paths through nodes marked 'S' or 'P'. After processing all test cases, the output of the print statement is the minimum of dp1[0] and dp2[0].**
