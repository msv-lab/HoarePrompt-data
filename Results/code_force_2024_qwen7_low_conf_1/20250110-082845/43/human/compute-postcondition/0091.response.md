`dp1[p]` is assigned the value of `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`. Given the initial conditions, `dp1[i]` is a finite value and `dp2[i]` is also a finite value, and `dp2[i] + 1` is simply one more than the value of `dp2[i]`. The value of `min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` will be the smaller of these two values. 

Since `p` is `fa[n-1] - 1` and the condition `p != -1` is satisfied, `p` is a valid index in the lists `dp1` and `dp2`. Therefore, `dp1[p]` will be updated by adding the minimum of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i] + 1` to its current value.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `fa` is a list starting with `-1` followed by the integers read from the input, `S` is a string read from the input, `dp1` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements except `dp1[p]` set to `0`, `dp2` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `0` (except possibly `dp2[n-1]` which may be `float('inf')`), `i` is `n-1`, `p` is `fa[n-1] - 1`, and `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`.**
