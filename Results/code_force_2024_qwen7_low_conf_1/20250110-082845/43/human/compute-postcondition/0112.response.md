Output State: **`dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `n` is a positive integer, `fa` is a list starting with `-1` followed by the integers read from the input, `S` is a string read from the input, `dp1` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is computed based on the minimum values of corresponding elements from previous steps, `dp2` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is also computed based on the minimum values of corresponding elements from previous steps, `i` is `0`, `p` is `fa[0] - 1`.

Explanation:
- The loop runs backward from `n-1` to `0`.
- For each `i`, `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` are updated based on the values of `dp1` and `dp2` at index `i+1` (i.e., `dp1[i+1]` and `dp2[i+1]`).
- The updates involve adding the minimum of certain values from the next indices.
- After the loop completes, `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` will hold the final computed values based on the entire string `S` and the list `fa`.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is `0`), `dp1` and `dp2` remain as initialized (`dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` are either `float('inf')` or finite values).

This ensures that the final values in `dp1` and `dp2` reflect the optimal solution considering the entire string `S` and the family relationship represented by `fa`.
