The code `dp1[i] = float('inf')` assigns the value `float('inf')` to `dp1[i]`. This impacts the variable `dp1` at index `i`. The previous conditions for setting `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified by this line of code. 

The output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`i` is within the range `0` to `n - 2`; if `S[i]` is `'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`, if `S[i]` is not `'S'` and is `'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')`; `p` is `fa[i] - 1` and its current value is not `-1`, in this case, `dp2[p]` is updated by adding the minimum of `dp1[i] + 1` and `dp2[i] + 1` to its current value; `dp1[i]` is now `float('inf')`.**
