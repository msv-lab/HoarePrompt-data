The code updates the value of `dp1[p]` by adding the minimum of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i] + 1` to it. The values of `i` and `p` are previously defined indices, and `dp1` and `dp2` are lists with specific values at those indices based on the initial conditions.

Since `p = fa[i] - 1`, the value of `dp1[p]` is updated. The values of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` are used in the calculation. After the operation, `dp1[p]` will hold the new value which is the result of the addition.

Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\), `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `S`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, and `dp1` and `dp2` retain their other values.**
