The code `dp1[p] += min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` impacts the variables `dp1[p]`, `dp1[i]`, and `dp2[i]`. Given the initial state, we know:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 2
- `p` is `fa[1] - 1`
- `dp1[1]` is `float('inf')`
- `dp2[1]` is `float('inf')`

Since `i` is 1, we can simplify `dp1[i]` to `dp1[1]` and `dp2[i]` to `dp2[1]`. Substituting these values into the code, we get:

`dp1[p] += min(dp1[1], dp2[1] + 1)`

Given that both `dp1[1]` and `dp2[1]` are `float('inf')`, the minimum value will be `float('inf')`. Therefore, the code simplifies to:

`dp1[p] += float('inf')`

Since adding `float('inf')` to any number (including itself) results in `float('inf')`, the value of `dp1[p]` remains `float('inf')`.

Thus, the updated state is:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 2
- `p` is `fa[1] - 1`
- `dp1[1]` is `float('inf')`
- `dp2[1]` is `float('inf')`
- `dp1[p]` is `float('inf')`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `p` is `fa[1] - 1`, `dp1[1]` is `float('inf')`, `dp2[1]` is `float('inf')`, `dp1[p]` is `float('inf')**.
