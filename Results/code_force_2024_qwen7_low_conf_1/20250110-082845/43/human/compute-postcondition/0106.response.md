Postcondition: ***`dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `fa` is a list starting with `-1` followed by the integers read from the input, `S` is a string read from the input, `dp1` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements except `dp1[p]` set to `0`, `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, `dp2` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp2[n-2]` possibly set to `float('inf')` and all other elements set to `0` (except possibly `dp2[n-1]` which may be `float('inf')`), `i` is `n-3`, `p` is `fa[n-3] - 1`, `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` if `p != -1`, and `dp2[n-3]` is `float('inf')` if `S[i] == 'P'`. If `S[i] != 'P'`, the state remains unchanged.***
