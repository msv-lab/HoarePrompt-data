The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition but likely accepts parameters through some external mechanism (e.g., global variables, command-line arguments, or passed via a caller function). However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, the function processes a set of inputs that include:

- An integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each test case, an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- A list of integers `a_2, ..., a_n` where \(1 \leq a_i < i\), indicating the edges in the tree.
- A string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C' indicating the type of each student.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

Given the described output cases, the function returns different values based on the input data. However, since no specific output cases are provided in the example, we can infer that the function returns a result related to processing the tree structure and the types of students.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, for each test case an integer `n`, a list of integers representing tree edges, and a string indicating student types, and returns a result based on processing this data.**
