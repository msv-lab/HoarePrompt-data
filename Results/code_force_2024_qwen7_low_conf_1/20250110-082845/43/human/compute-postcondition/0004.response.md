The code initializes two lists, `dp1` and `dp2`, both of size `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. The variables `t`, `n`, `fa`, and `S` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `fa` is a list starting with -1 followed by n integers from the input; `S` is the string input by the user; `dp1` is a list of n+1 zeros; `dp2` is a list of n+1 zeros**
