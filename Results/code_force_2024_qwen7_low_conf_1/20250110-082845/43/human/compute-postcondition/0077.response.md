`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` will take the value of an integer input from the user. The initial states of `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given code snippet. The loop condition (checking if the user input is a positive integer) also remains in effect.

Output State: **`dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `n` is an input integer**
