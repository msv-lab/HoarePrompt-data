The code `dp2[i] = float('inf')` sets the value of `dp2[i]` to infinity (`float('inf')`). The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the condition `S[i]` is not equal to 'S' and the current value of `S[i]` is 'P' also remains valid. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\), and `S[i]` is not equal to 'S', the current value of `S[i]` is 'P'; `dp2[i]` is float('inf')**
