The code snippet sets `dp1[i]` to `float('inf')`. Given that `i` is `n-3`, this means `dp1[n-3]` is now `float('inf')`. All other elements in `dp1` remain unchanged, and `dp2` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `fa` is a list starting with `-1` followed by the integers read from the input, `S` is a string read from the input, `dp1` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp1[n-3]` set to `float('inf')` and all other elements except `dp1[p]` set to `0`, `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, `dp2` is a list of length `n + 1` with `dp2[n-2]` possibly set to `float('inf')` and all other elements set to `0` (except possibly `dp2[n-1]` which may be `float('inf')`), `i` is `n-3`, `p` is `fa[n-3] - 1`, `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` if `p != -1`. If `p == -1`, no changes are made to the lists `dp1` and `dp2`.**
