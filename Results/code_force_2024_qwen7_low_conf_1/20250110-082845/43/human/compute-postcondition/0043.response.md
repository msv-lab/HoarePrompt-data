Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `S` is the input string.
- `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0.
- `fa` is `[ -1, a1, a2, ..., an ]`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- The minimum of `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` is 0.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Initialization and Condition**: The loop runs from `n - 1` down to `0`. This means the loop will start executing as long as `i` is within the range from `n - 1` to `0` (inclusive).
2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `n - 1` and decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
3. **List `dp1` and `dp2`**: Both `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of length `n + 1`, and all their elements are initialized to 0.
4. **List `fa`**: The list `fa` is initialized with `-1` followed by integers `a1, a2, ..., an`.

### Required States:
- The loop will execute if `i` is within the range from `n - 1` to `0`. Therefore, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1` and greater than or equal to 0.
- Since the loop starts at `n - 1` and decreases, we only need to ensure that `i` is at least 0 initially, which is inherently true because the loop will run down to 0.
- No specific adjustments are needed for `S`, `dp1`, `dp2`, `fa`, or `n` based on the given conditions. The initial values of these variables are already valid for the loop to start.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `i` is within the valid range for the loop. However, since the loop starts at `n - 1` and iterates downwards, we need to ensure that `i` is non-negative and less than or equal to `n - 1`.

State: **`total` is not relevant here, `i` is `n - 1`, `S` is the input string, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0, `fa` is `[ -1, a1, a2, ..., an ]`, `n` is an input integer**.

But more specifically focusing on what is required for the loop to execute:

State: **`i` is `n - 1`** (or simply, `i` should be within the range `0` to `n - 1`).

However, since the loop starts at `n - 1` and iterates downwards, no additional state adjustments are necessary beyond ensuring `i` is valid at the start.

Final State: **No additional state adjustments needed, but `i` should be within the range `0` to `n - 1`**.
