Postcondition: ***`n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\), `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `S`. If `S[i]` is 'S', `dp1[i]` is positive infinity. If `S[i]` is not 'S', specifically when `S[i]` is 'P', then `dp2[i]` is set to float('inf'). If `S[i]` is neither 'S' nor 'P', no change occurs.***
