Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial Loop Condition**: The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until `i = 0`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is within the range `0` to `n - 2`.
   - If `p != -1`, then:
     - `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`.
     - `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`.
   - If `p == -1`, no updates are made to `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]`.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - Since the loop iterates in reverse (from `n-1` down to `0`), at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `0` or `1` (since `i` was within the range `0` to `n-2` and now it is one less).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `0` (i.e., `i` must be `1` if `n > 2`).

4. **Update Conditions**:
   - If `p != -1`, the update conditions apply.
   - If `p == -1`, no updates are made.

Given that the loop will decrement `i` by 1, we need to consider the next value of `i`:

- If `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, then the new value of `i` will be `0`.
- If `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, then the loop would terminate because `i` cannot go below `0`.

Since `i` must be within the range `0` to `n - 2` for the loop to continue, and considering the decrement operation, `i` should be `1` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `1` and `n` must be greater than `2`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
