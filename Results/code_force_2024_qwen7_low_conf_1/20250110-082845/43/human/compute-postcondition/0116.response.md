Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a tree structure defined by a list of edges and a string indicating the type of each student. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to reach a leaf node starting from the root, considering two different scenarios: one where the path can only go through nodes marked 'P' or 'S', and another where the path can only go through nodes marked 'S' or 'P'. It then prints the minimum cost among these two scenarios for each test case.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If a student type is 'C', the code currently does not account for this scenario. This means that 'C' students do not influence the cost calculation, which could lead to incorrect results if 'C' students should also contribute to the cost in some way.
- If the tree is a single node (i.e., `n` is 2), the code still initializes `dp1` and `dp2` arrays, but it does not properly handle the case where there are no edges. In this edge case, the `for` loop would not execute, leading to potential issues in the `dp` arrays.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code assumes that the input tree is always a valid tree (i.e., a connected acyclic graph). However, it does not check for this condition. If the input is not a valid tree, the code might produce incorrect results or fail due to undefined behavior.

In summary, the function processes multiple test cases with tree structures and student types, calculates the minimum cost to reach a leaf node under two different scenarios, and prints the minimum cost for each test case. However, it does not handle certain edge cases and missing functionality related to invalid inputs or student types other than 'P' and 'S'.
