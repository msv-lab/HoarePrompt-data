The code `fa = [-1] + list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and converts them to a list of integers. It then concatenates this list with `[-1]`. 

Since the initial state of `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, and `n` is an input integer, these variables are not affected by the code. The variable `fa` is initialized with the new list.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value.
- `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `fa` is a list starting with `-1` followed by the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value; `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf') or a finite value; `n` is an input integer; `fa` is a list starting with `-1` followed by the integers read from the input.**
