The code reads an integer value for `n` from the input. This sets the value of `n` to an integer input, which will be used to define the size of subsequent lists and strings. However, the initial value of `t` is not updated by this line of code, so `t` remains as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5**
