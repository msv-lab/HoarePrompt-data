The code `dp2[i] = float('inf')` sets the value of `dp2[i]` to infinity (`float('inf')`). The precondition states that `i` is within the range `0` to `n - 1`, the element at index `i` in list `S` is not `'S'`, and the element at index `i` in list `S` is `'P'`. These conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range `0` to `n - 1`; the element at index `i` in list `S` is not `'S'` and is `'P'`; `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`i` is within the range `0` to `n - 1`; the element at index `i` in list `S` is not `'S'` and is `'P'`; `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')`**.
