Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `fa` is a list starting with -1 followed by \(n\) integers from the input.
   - `S` is the string input by the user.
   - `dp1` is a list of \(n+1\) zeros.
   - `dp2` is a list of \(n+1\) zeros.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Requirements:**
   - The loop runs in reverse order from \(n-1\) to \(0\). Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of \(0\) to \(n-1\).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `i` must start at \(n-1\) and decrement until it reaches \(0\).
   - The value of `i` in the first iteration is \(n-1\), and it should continue decrementing until it reaches \(0\).

Given these points, we need to ensure that:
- `i` starts at \(n-1\).
- `i` is initialized to \(n-1\) and then decremented in each iteration until it reaches \(0\).

Since `i` is initialized to \(n-1\) in the loop itself (not in the initial state), no explicit initialization is needed for `i` in the provided states. However, we need to ensure that `n` is within the specified bounds.

Thus, the required states to adjust for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\)**
