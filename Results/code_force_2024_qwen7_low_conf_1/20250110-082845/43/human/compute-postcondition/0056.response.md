Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop**: The loop runs in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`. The variable `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Identify the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is within the range `0` to `n - 1`.
   - If `S[i]` is `'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`.
   - If `S[i]` is not `'S'` and is `'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')`.
   - `p` is `fa[i] - 1` and its current value is not `-1`.
   - In this case, `dp2[p]` is updated by adding the minimum of `dp1[i] + 1` and `dp2[i] + 1` to its current value.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration's State**:
   - Since the loop runs in reverse, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_end`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end - 1`.

4. **Check Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - Ensure that `i_end - 1` is still within the range `0` to `n - 1`.
   - If `S[i_end - 1]` is `'S'`, then `dp1[i_end - 1]` is set to `float('inf')`.
   - If `S[i_end - 1]` is not `'S'` and is `'P'`, then `dp2[i_end - 1]` is set to `float('inf')`.
   - Check if `p` (which is `fa[i_end - 1] - 1`) is not `-1`. If it is not `-1`, update `dp2[p]` by adding the minimum of `dp1[i_end - 1] + 1` and `dp2[i_end - 1] + 1` to its current value.

Given these conditions, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

State: **`i` is within the range `0` to `n - 2`, if `S[i]` is `'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`, if `S[i]` is not `'S'` and is `'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1` and its current value is not `-1`, in this case, `dp2[p]` is updated by adding the minimum of `dp1[i] + 1` and `dp2[i] + 1` to its current value.**
