Postcondition: **`dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `fa` is a list starting with `-1` followed by the integers read from the input, `S` is a string read from the input, `dp1` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `0`, `dp2` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `0` (except possibly `dp2[n-1]` which may be `float('inf')`), `i` is `n-1`. If `S[i]` is `'S'`, then `dp1[n-1]` is set to `float('inf')`. If `S[i]` is not `'S'`, then `dp1` and `dp2` remain unchanged unless `S[i]` is `'P'`, in which case no changes occur.**
