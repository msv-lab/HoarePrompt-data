Postcondition: ***`n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\), `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `S`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `S[i]` is 'S', `dp1[i]` is positive infinity, if `S[i]` is 'P', `dp2[i]` is float('inf'), if `S[i]` is neither 'S' nor 'P', no change occurs. The condition `p != -1` holds true.***
