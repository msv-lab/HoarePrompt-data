Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\), `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `S`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. After the loop finishes executing, if `S[i]` is 'S', `dp1[i]` will be `float('inf')`, otherwise `dp1[i]` will retain its previous value. Similarly, if `S[i]` is 'P', `dp2[i]` will be `float('inf')`, otherwise `dp2[i]` will retain its previous value. For each valid `p` (i.e., `p != -1`), `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. If `p == -1`, no updates are made to `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]`.**
