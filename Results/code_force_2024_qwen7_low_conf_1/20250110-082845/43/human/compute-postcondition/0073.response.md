Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `p` is `fa[1] - 1`, `dp1[1]` is `float('inf')`, `dp2[1]` is `float('inf')`. If `p` is not `-1`, then `dp1[p]` is `float('inf')` and `dp2[p]` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true regardless of the value of `p`.***
