According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more inputs from the user. At the end of the previous iteration, `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` are updated based on the given conditions, and the minimum of `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` is printed.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop will execute again if there is another input from the user.
2. The values of `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` will be updated based on the new input.
3. The minimum of the updated `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` will be printed at the end of this iteration.

Since the specific conditions for updating `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` are not provided, we can only state that these values will be updated based on the new input. However, we know that the loop will continue as long as there is an additional input.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` will be updated based on the new input.
- The minimum of the updated `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` will be printed.

State: **`dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` are updated based on the new input, and the minimum of `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` is printed**.
