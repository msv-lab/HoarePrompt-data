Postcondition: ***`S[i]` is a character, `dp1[i]` is float('inf') if `S[i]` is 'S', else unchanged, `dp2[i]` is float('inf'), `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `p != -1`, then `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. The overall state after the if-else block executes remains consistent with these conditions.***
