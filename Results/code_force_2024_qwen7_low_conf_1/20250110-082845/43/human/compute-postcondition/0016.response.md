The code updates `dp2[p]` by adding the minimum value between `dp1[i] + 1` and `dp2[i]`. The initial values of the variables are as follows:

- `n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\)
- `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `S`
- `p` is `fa[i] - 1`
- `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`
- `dp1` and `dp2` retain their other values.

After executing the line of code `dp2[p] += min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`:

- `dp1[p]` is already updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`
- `dp2[p]` is now `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`

The output state after the code execution is:

Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and \(10^5\), `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `S`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`**
