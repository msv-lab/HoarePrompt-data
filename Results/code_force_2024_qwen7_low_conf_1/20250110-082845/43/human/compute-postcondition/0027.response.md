Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - \( S[i] \) is a character.
   - \( dp1[i] \) is \( \text{float('inf')} \) if \( S[i] \) is 'S', else unchanged.
   - \( dp2[i] \) is \( \text{float('inf')} \) if \( S[i] \) is 'P', else unchanged.
   - \( p = fa[i] - 1 \).
   - If \( p \neq -1 \), then \( dp2[p] \) is updated to \( dp2[p] + \min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i]) \). Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Next Iteration's State**:
   - The loop starts from \( n-1 \) and goes down to 0, decrementing by 1 each time.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume we are currently processing \( i = k \).

4. **Next Iteration (i.e., \( i = k-1 \))**:
   - The value of \( S[k-1] \) is a character.
   - \( dp1[k-1] \) is \( \text{float('inf')} \) if \( S[k-1] \) is 'S', else unchanged.
   - \( dp2[k-1] \) is \( \text{float('inf')} \) if \( S[k-1] \) is 'P', else unchanged.
   - \( p = fa[k-1] - 1 \).
   - If \( p \neq -1 \), then \( dp2[p] \) is updated to \( dp2[p] + \min(dp1[k-1] + 1, dp2[k-1]) \). Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements \( i \), the new \( i \) will be \( k-1 \).
   - \( S[k-1] \) remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - \( dp1[k-1] \) will be \( \text{float('inf')} \) if \( S[k-1] \) is 'S', else unchanged.
   - \( dp2[k-1] \) will be \( \text{float('inf')} \) if \( S[k-1] \) is 'P', else unchanged.
   - \( p = fa[k-1] - 1 \).
   - If \( p \neq -1 \), then \( dp2[p] \) will be updated to \( dp2[p] + \min(dp1[k-1] + 1, dp2[k-1]) \).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`S[i]` is a character, `dp1[i]` is float('inf') if `S[i]` is 'S', else unchanged, `dp2[i]` is float('inf') if `S[i]` is 'P', else unchanged, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`. If `p != -1`, then `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`**.
