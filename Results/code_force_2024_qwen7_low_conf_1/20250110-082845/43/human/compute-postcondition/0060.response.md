Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range `0` to `n - 2`. `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is `'S'`. `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')` if `S[i]` is not `'S'` and is `'P'`. If `S[i]` is `'P'`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1` and its current value is not `-1`, in this case, `dp2[p]` is updated by adding the minimum of `dp1[i] + 1` and `dp2[i] + 1` to its current value.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block, ensuring that all possible outcomes are covered while maintaining the initial state and updates as described in the respective parts.
