`dp2[p]` is updated to the value of `dp2[p]` plus the minimum of `dp1[i] + 1` and `dp2[i]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `p` is `fa[1] - 1`, the expression simplifies to:

- `dp2[p] += min(dp1[1] + 1, dp2[1])`

Since `dp1[1]` is `float('inf')` and `dp2[1]` is also `float('inf')`, the minimum of `dp1[1] + 1` and `dp2[1]` is `float('inf')`. Therefore, `dp2[p]` remains unchanged because adding `float('inf')` to itself does not change its value.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `p` is `fa[1] - 1`, `dp1[1]` is `float('inf')`, `dp2[1]` is `float('inf')`, `dp1[p]` is `float('inf')`, `dp2[p]` is `dp2[p]` (unchanged)**
