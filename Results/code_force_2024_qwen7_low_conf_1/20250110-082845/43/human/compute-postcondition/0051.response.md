`p` is assigned the value `fa[i] - 1`. The value of `fa[i]` can be any integer, so `p` is the value of `fa[i]` decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is within the range `0` to `n - 1`; if `S[i]` is `'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`; if `S[i]` is not `'S'` and is `'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')`; `p` is `fa[i] - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is within the range `0` to `n - 1`; if `S[i]` is `'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`; if `S[i]` is not `'S'` and is `'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')`; `p` is `fa[i] - 1`**.
