Postcondition: ***`i` is within the range `0` to `n - 1`. If `S[i]` is `'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`. If `S[i]` is not `'S'` and is `'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is set to `float('inf')`. `p` is `fa[i] - 1` and its current value is not `-1`. In this case, `dp2[p]` is updated by adding the minimum of `dp1[i] + 1` and `dp2[i] + 1` to its current value.***
