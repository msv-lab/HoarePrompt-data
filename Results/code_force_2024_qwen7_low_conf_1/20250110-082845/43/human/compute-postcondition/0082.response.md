Postcondition: **`dp1[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `dp2[0]` is either `float('inf')` or a finite value, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `fa` is a list starting with `-1` followed by the integers read from the input, `S` is a string read from the input, `dp1` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `0`, `dp2` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `0`, `i` is `n-1`. The current value of `S[i]` is `'S'`.**
