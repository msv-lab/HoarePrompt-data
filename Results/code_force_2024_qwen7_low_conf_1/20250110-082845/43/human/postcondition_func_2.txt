The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, a list of integers `edges`, and a string `student_types`. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything explicitly, but the final state includes the last computed result for each test case being printed. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs for `n` (e.g., values less than 2 or greater than \(10^5\)) or issues with the format of the `edges` and `student_types` inputs. If `func_1` has missing functionality or handling for certain edge cases, those would also affect the final state.
