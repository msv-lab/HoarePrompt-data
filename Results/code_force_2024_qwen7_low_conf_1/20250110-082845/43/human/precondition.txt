t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i < i and form a tree structure; s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C' indicating the type of student in each room. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
