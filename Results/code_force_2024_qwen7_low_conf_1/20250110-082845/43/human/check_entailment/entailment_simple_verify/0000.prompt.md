You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a son who really wanted to go to MIT. The college dormitory at
MIT (Moldova Institute of Technology) can be represented as a tree with n
vertices, each vertex being a room with exactly one student. A tree is a
connected undirected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges.

Tonight, there are three types of students:

  * students who want to party and play music (marked with \texttt{P} ), 
  * students who wish to sleep and enjoy silence (marked with \texttt{S} ), and 
  * students who don't care (marked with \texttt{C} ). 

Initially, all the edges are thin walls which allow music to pass through, so
when a partying student puts music on, it will be heard in every room.
However, we can place some thick walls on any edges — thick walls don't allow
music to pass through them.

The university wants to install some thick walls so that every partying
student can play music, and no sleepy student can hear it.

Because the university lost a lot of money in a naming rights lawsuit, they
ask you to find the minimum number of thick walls they will need to use.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10^5 ) —
the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers a_2, \dots , a_n (1
\leq a_i < i ) — it means there is an edge between i and a_i in the tree.

The third line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting of
characters \texttt{P} , \texttt{S} , and \texttt{C} , denoting that student i
is of type s_i .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of thick
walls needed.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    CSP
    
    4
    
    1 2 2
    
    PCSS
    
    4
    
    1 2 2
    
    PPSS

Output

    1
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first case, we can install one thick wall between rooms 1 and 2 , as
shown below. We cannot install 0 walls, since then the music from room 3 will
reach room 2 where a student wants to sleep, so the answer is 1 . There are
other valid solutions.

After processing all test cases, the output of the print statement is the minimum of dp1[0] and dp2[0].



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of thick walls required is flawed. Let's consider a potential case to demonstrate why the program is incorrect.

Consider the following input:
```
3
4
1 2 2
PCSS
```

According to the problem description, the tree structure and the student types are as follows:
- Students at nodes: P, C, S, S
- Edges: (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum number of thick walls required. However, the logic in the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays does not correctly account for the propagation of music from partying students to sleeping students.

In the given example, the correct answer should be 1, as placing a thick wall between node 2 and node 3 would isolate the partying student from the sleeping student without affecting the other sleeping student.

However, the current implementation may incorrectly calculate the result. For instance, if the program fails to properly propagate the values or does not correctly handle the conditions for setting `dp1` and `dp2`, it might produce an incorrect answer.

Given this, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
