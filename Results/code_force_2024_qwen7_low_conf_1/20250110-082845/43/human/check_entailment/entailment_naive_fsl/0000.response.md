Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of thick walls required is flawed. Let's consider a potential case to demonstrate why the program is incorrect.

Consider the following input:
```
3
4
1 2 2
PCSS
```

According to the problem description, the tree structure and the student types are as follows:
- Students at nodes: P, C, S, S
- Edges: (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum number of thick walls required. However, the logic in the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays does not correctly account for the propagation of music from partying students to sleeping students.

In the given example, the correct answer should be 1, as placing a thick wall between node 2 and node 3 would isolate the partying student from the sleeping student without affecting the other sleeping student.

However, the current implementation may incorrectly calculate the result. For instance, if the program fails to properly propagate the values or does not correctly handle the conditions for setting `dp1` and `dp2`, it might produce an incorrect answer.

Given this, the program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
