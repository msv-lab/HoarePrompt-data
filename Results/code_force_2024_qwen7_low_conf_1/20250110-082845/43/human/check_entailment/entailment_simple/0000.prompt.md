You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vladislav has a son who really wanted to go to MIT. The college dormitory at
MIT (Moldova Institute of Technology) can be represented as a tree with n
vertices, each vertex being a room with exactly one student. A tree is a
connected undirected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges.

Tonight, there are three types of students:

  * students who want to party and play music (marked with \texttt{P} ), 
  * students who wish to sleep and enjoy silence (marked with \texttt{S} ), and 
  * students who don't care (marked with \texttt{C} ). 

Initially, all the edges are thin walls which allow music to pass through, so
when a partying student puts music on, it will be heard in every room.
However, we can place some thick walls on any edges — thick walls don't allow
music to pass through them.

The university wants to install some thick walls so that every partying
student can play music, and no sleepy student can hear it.

Because the university lost a lot of money in a naming rights lawsuit, they
ask you to find the minimum number of thick walls they will need to use.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10^5 ) —
the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers a_2, \dots , a_n (1
\leq a_i < i ) — it means there is an edge between i and a_i in the tree.

The third line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting of
characters \texttt{P} , \texttt{S} , and \texttt{C} , denoting that student i
is of type s_i .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of thick
walls needed.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    CSP
    
    4
    
    1 2 2
    
    PCSS
    
    4
    
    1 2 2
    
    PPSS

Output

    1
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first case, we can install one thick wall between rooms 1 and 2 , as
shown below. We cannot install 0 walls, since then the music from room 3 will
reach room 2 where a student wants to sleep, so the answer is 1 . There are
other valid solutions.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a list of integers a_2, ..., a_n is provided such that 1 ≤ a_i < i, indicating the edges in the tree, and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C' indicating the type of each student. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        fa = [-1] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        S = input()
        
        dp1, dp2 = [0] * (n + 1), [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if S[i] == 'S':
                dp1[i] = float('inf')
            elif S[i] == 'P':
                dp2[i] = float('inf')
            p = fa[i] - 1
            if p != -1:
                dp1[p] += min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)
                dp2[p] += min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])
        
        print(min(dp1[0], dp2[0]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, for each test case: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, fa is a list of integers where fa[i] (0-indexed) is the parent of node i+1 in the tree, S is a string of length n consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C', dp1 and dp2 are lists of integers where dp1[i] represents the minimum cost to reach a leaf node starting from node i (considering only paths through nodes marked 'P' or 'S'), and dp2[i] represents the same but considering only paths through nodes marked 'S' or 'P'. After processing all test cases, the output of the print statement is the minimum of dp1[0] and dp2[0].

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
