The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a tree structure defined by a list of edges and a string indicating the type of each student. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to reach a leaf node starting from the root, considering two different scenarios: one where the path can only go through nodes marked 'P' or 'S', and another where the path can only go through nodes marked 'S' or 'P'. It then prints the minimum cost among these two scenarios for each test case.
