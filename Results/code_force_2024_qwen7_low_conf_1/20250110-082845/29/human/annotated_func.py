#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m. The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a` which is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (gcd). It does this by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` contains the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. The function then returns `a` as the gcd. This process handles all valid inputs where `a` and `b` are positive integers within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of times the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) evaluates to true for all \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\) and all \(b\) in the range \([1, m]\), `a` is `n`, and `b` is `m`. If the loop does not execute at all, then `n` and `m` are positive integers, `count` is 0, and `a` is 1, `b` is 1.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of times the condition (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0 evaluates to true for all a in the range [1, n] and all b in the range [1, m]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It iterates over all pairs (a, b) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). For each pair, it checks whether the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds. If the condition is true, it increments the `count` variable. After completing the iterations, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the total number of times the condition was satisfied.
