According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `b` from 1 to `m + 1`. The loop continues as long as `b` is less than `m + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `a` is 2
- `b` is a value less than `m + 1`
- `count` is 2
- The expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) evaluates to 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented and should still be less than `m + 1`. Therefore, `b` will be increased by 1, making it equal to the current value of `b` plus 1.

Since `b` was less than `m + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `b` by 1 will result in a new value for `b` that is still less than `m + 1`.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`a` is 2, `b` is a value less than `m + 1`, `count` is 2, and the expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) evaluates to 0.**

Note: The specific value of `b` is not given, but it is understood that the loop will continue if `b + 1` is still less than `m + 1`.
