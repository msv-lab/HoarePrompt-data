`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `m` is still greater than 0, and the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` holds true. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `count` is 1, `a` is 1, the value of `b` is not specified but the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` holds true**
