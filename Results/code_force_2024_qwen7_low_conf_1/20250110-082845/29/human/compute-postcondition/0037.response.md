Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of times the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) evaluates to true for all \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\) and all \(b\) in the range \([1, m]\), `a` is `n`, and `b` is `m`. If the loop does not execute at all, then `n` and `m` are positive integers, `count` is 0, and `a` is 1, `b` is 1.**
