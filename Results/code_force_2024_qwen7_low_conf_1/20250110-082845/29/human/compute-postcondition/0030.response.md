Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is 3
   - `b` is 1
   - `count` is 1
   - The condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))` is checked, and if it is true, `count` remains 1. Since the else part does not exist or change the value of `count`, the final value of `count` remains 1 regardless of the condition's truth value.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for b in range(1, m + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop starts with `b = 1` and increments `b` until `b` reaches `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was 1, and the loop is about to check the next value of `b`, which would be `b = 2`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `b` is incremented by 1, the new value of `b` will be 2.
   - The values of `a` and `count` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - The condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))` will be evaluated again with `b = 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a` is 3, `b` is 2, and `count` is 1**
