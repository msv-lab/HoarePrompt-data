The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. The function returns a count which is the number of times the condition (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0 evaluates to true for all a in the range [1, n] and all b in the range [1, m].

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `m`, and return the count of times the given condition is true for all a in the range [1, n] and all b in the range [1, m].
