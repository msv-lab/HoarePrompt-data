Postcondition: ***`a` is 3, `b` is 1, and `count` is 1. The condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))` is checked, and if it is true, `count` remains 1. Since the else part does not exist or change the value of `count`, the final value of `count` remains 1 regardless of the condition's truth value.***
