`count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count` is 2, so after incrementing, `count` becomes 3. The values of `a`, `b`, and the expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 2, `b` is a value less than `m + 1`, `count` is 3, and the expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) evaluates to 0.**
