Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `count` is either 1 or 2.
   - `a` is 1.
   - The value of `b` satisfies the condition `(1 + b) % (b * func_1(1, b)) == 0`. If this condition is satisfied, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `b` in the range from 1 to `m`.

3. **State Changes During Loop Execution**:
   - For each value of `b` from 1 to `m-1` (since `m` is included in the range), the loop will check if `(1 + b) % (b * func_1(1, b)) == 0`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, `count` will be incremented by 1.
   - If the condition is not satisfied, `count` remains 1.

4. **Current State Analysis**:
   - We need to determine what the state will be at the start of the next iteration of the loop, assuming the loop is about to run for the next value of `b`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since the current value of `b` is the last value processed in the previous iteration, the next value of `b` will be `b + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `b` will be `b + 1`.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `m` remains the same since it is an upper bound of the range and does not change within the loop.
   - `count` could either be 1 or 2 depending on the outcome of the condition for the current `b`. If the condition was satisfied for the current `b`, `count` will be 2; otherwise, it will remain 1.
   - `a` remains 1 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - The value of `b` changes to `b + 1`.

7. **Final State**:
   - The condition `(1 + (b + 1)) % ((b + 1) * func_1(1, (b + 1))) == 0` must be checked for the next iteration.
   - If the condition is satisfied, `count` becomes 2; otherwise, it remains 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `count` is either 1 or 2, `a` is 1, and the value of `b` is `b + 1` with the condition `(1 + (b + 1)) % ((b + 1) * func_1(1, (b + 1))) == 0` to be checked. If the condition is satisfied, `count` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.**
