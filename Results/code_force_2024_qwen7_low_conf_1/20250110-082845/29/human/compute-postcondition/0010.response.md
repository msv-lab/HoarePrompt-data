`count` is incremented by 1. Initially, `count` is either 1 or 2. If `count` was 1, it will become 2. If `count` was 2, it will become 3. The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `count` is either 2 or 3, `a` is 1, and `b` is `b + 1` with the condition `(1 + (b + 1)) % ((b + 1) * func_1(1, (b + 1))) == 0` to be checked.**
