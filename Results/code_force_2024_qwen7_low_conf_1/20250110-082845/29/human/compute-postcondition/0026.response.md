Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial values given are:
   - `a` is 3.
   - `b` is any value less than `m`.
   - `count` is the number of iterations where the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) evaluates to 0.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `m` inclusive.
   - For each value of `b`, the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) is checked, and if true, `count` is incremented.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will start executing when `b` is within the range [1, `m`].
   - The initial value of `b` must be such that it falls within this range. Since `b` is any value less than `m`, it must be at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `a` remains 3 throughout the loop.
   - `b` needs to be set to its starting value, which should be 1 (the smallest possible value in the range).
   - `count` should be initialized to 0 since we are counting the number of iterations where the condition evaluates to 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `a` is 3.
- `b` is set to 1 (the starting value).
- `count` is set to 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is 3, `b` is 1, `count` is 0**
