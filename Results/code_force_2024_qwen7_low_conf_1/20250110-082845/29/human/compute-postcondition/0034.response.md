The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Given the initial state:
- `a` is 3
- `b` is 3
- `count` is 2

After executing `count += 1`, the value of `count` will be updated to 3. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a` is 3
- `b` is 3
- `count` is 3

Output State: **`a` is 3, `b` is 3, `count` is 3**
