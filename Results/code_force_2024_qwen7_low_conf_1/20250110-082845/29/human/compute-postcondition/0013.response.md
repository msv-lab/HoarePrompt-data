Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States and Conditions:**
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `count` is the number of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` was satisfied for `b` in the range `[1, m]`.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` is `m`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `a` in the range `[1, n + 1]`.
   - Since `a` starts at 1, it will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Previous Iteration State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 1, and `b` is `m`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `a` should become 2.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - The value of `b` remains `m`.
   - The value of `count` does not change unless the condition inside the loop is satisfied.

6. **Final State:**
   - `a` is now 2.
   - `b` is still `m`.
   - `count` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `m` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` was satisfied for `b` in the range `[1, m]`, `a` is 2, and `b` is `m`.**
