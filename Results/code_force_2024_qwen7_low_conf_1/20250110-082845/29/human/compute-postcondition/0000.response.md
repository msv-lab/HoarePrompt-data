The code initializes a new variable `count` and assigns it the value `0`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6; `count` is 0**
