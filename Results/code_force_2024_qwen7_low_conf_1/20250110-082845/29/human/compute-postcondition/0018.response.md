To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `a` is 2
  - `b` is a value less than `m`
  - `count` is incremented by 1
  - The expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) evaluates to 0

### Loop Condition:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for b in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` = 2
   - `b` is a value less than `m`
   - `count` has been incremented by 1
   - Expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) evaluates to 0

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs over values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
   - For each value of `b`, the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) must hold true.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We know `b` was some value less than `m` such that the condition was satisfied.
   - Letâ€™s denote this value as \( b_{\text{prev}} \). So, \( b_{\text{prev}} < m \).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `b` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, \( b_{\text{next}} = b_{\text{prev}} + 1 \).

5. **New State**:
   - `a` remains unchanged, so `a` is still 2.
   - `b` will now be \( b_{\text{prev}} + 1 \), but since we don't know the exact value of \( b_{\text{prev}} \), we can only say \( b \) is the next integer after the previous value of `b` which was less than `m`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1 for each successful iteration, so it will be incremented again.
   - The expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) must still evaluate to 0 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
- `a` is still 2.
- `b` is \( b_{\text{prev}} + 1 \), where \( b_{\text{prev}} < m \).
- `count` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) must evaluate to 0.

### Adjusted States:
- `a` is 2
- `b` must be a value less than `m` plus 1 (i.e., \( b < m + 1 \))
- `count` is incremented by 1
- The expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) must evaluate to 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is 2, `b` is a value less than `m + 1`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) evaluates to 0**
