The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it operates based on implicit input through variables `n` and `m`, where `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), with the sum of `n` or `m` over all test cases not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^6\). The function returns a value based on the processing of these variables.

Given the provided output cases are not specified directly, we can infer that the function processes the test cases and returns some form of result or summary based on the values of `n` and `m`.
