Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `outs` is a list of length `t`, where each element is the value of `tot - 1` computed for each iteration of the outer loop.
- `tt` is `t - 1`.
- `n` and `m` are the integers read from input during the last iteration of the outer loop.
- `tot` is the sum of \((n + b) // b^2\) for each \(b\) in the range from 1 to `m`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for out in outs:
    print(out)
```

### Analysis of Each Iteration:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `outs` list and prints each element.
- After the loop completes, all elements in `outs` have been printed.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- The loop will execute exactly `t` times because `outs` is a list of length `t`.
- During each iteration, the value of `out` will be printed, which is an element from the `outs` list.
- After the loop completes, the value of `outs` will no longer matter since it has been fully iterated over and all its elements have been printed.

### Final Values:
- `t` remains the same as the initial value.
- `outs` is a list of length `t`, and after all elements have been printed, it no longer holds any relevant information.
- `tt` is `t - 1` and remains unchanged.
- `n` and `m` are the integers read from input during the last iteration of the outer loop and do not change.
- `tot` is the sum of \((n + b) // b^2\) for each \(b\) in the range from 1 to `m` and remains unchanged.

### Output State:
Since the loop executes exactly `t` times and all elements in `outs` are printed, the final state of the variables is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `outs` is a list of length `t`, `tt` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are the integers read from input during the last iteration of the outer loop, `tot` is the sum of \((n + b) // b^2\) for each \(b\) in the range from 1 to `m`, and all elements in `outs` have been printed.**
