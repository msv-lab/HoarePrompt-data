Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the sum of \((n + b) // b^2\) for \(b\) ranging from 1 to \(m\), subtracts 1 from this sum, and stores the result in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each stored result. The function implicitly takes the number of test cases \(t\) and the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case as input. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all calculated results have been printed. Potential edge cases include the constraints on \(t\), \(n\), and \(m\): \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), and the sum of \(n\) or \(m\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\). There is no missing functionality in the provided code.**
