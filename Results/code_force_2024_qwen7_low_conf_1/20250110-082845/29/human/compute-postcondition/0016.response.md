The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial state indicates that `a` is 2, `b` is a value less than `m`, and the expression `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))` evaluates to 0. The value of `count` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, meaning it was previously incremented based on the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0`.

After executing `count += 1`, the value of `count` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.

Output State: **`a` is 2, `b` is a value less than `m`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the expression `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))` evaluates to 0.**
