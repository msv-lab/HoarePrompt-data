Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It iterates over all pairs (a, b) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). For each pair, it checks whether the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds. If the condition is true, it increments the `count` variable. After completing the iterations, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the total number of times the condition was satisfied.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `n` or `m` is 1, the inner loop will only run once.
- If `func_1(a, b)` returns 0 for any pair (a, b), the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) would be undefined due to division by zero. However, since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine the exact behavior in this case. Assuming `func_1` does not return 0 for any valid input, this edge case does not apply.

**Missing functionality:**
- The provided code does not specify what `func_1(a, b)` does. If `func_1` returns 0 for any pair (a, b), the condition would be undefined, potentially leading to an error. This should be addressed to ensure the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.
