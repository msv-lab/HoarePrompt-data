Postcondition: ***`a` is 2, `b` is a value less than `m + 1`, `count` is 2, and the expression \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b))\) evaluates to 0.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and the if condition already satisfies the given postcondition, the overall postcondition remains the same as the postcondition of the if part.
