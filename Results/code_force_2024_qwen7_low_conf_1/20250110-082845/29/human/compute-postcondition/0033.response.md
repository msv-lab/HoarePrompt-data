Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `a` is 3
   - `b` is 2
   - `count` is 2
   - The condition for incrementing `count` is `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```
   for b in range(1, m + 1):
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts with `b = 1` and increments `b` by 1 in each iteration until `b` reaches `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was 2.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented from 2 to 3.
   - Therefore, `b` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `a` remains unchanged, so `a` is still 3.
   - `b` is incremented to 3.
   - The value of `count` does not depend on `b` in this context, so it remains 2.

6. **Final State**:
   - `a` is 3
   - `b` is 3
   - `count` is 2

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`a` is 3, `b` is 3, `count` is 2**.
