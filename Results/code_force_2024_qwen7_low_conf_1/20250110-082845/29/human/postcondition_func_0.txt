The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (gcd). It does this by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` contains the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. The function then returns `a` as the gcd. This process handles all valid inputs where `a` and `b` are positive integers within the specified range.
