Reasoning:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part of the code is correct and works as intended.

2. **Main Logic**: The function `func_2` iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. For each pair, it checks whether the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` using the GCD function `func_1`.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition `if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:` is correctly implemented to verify the given condition. This ensures that the pair `(a, b)` satisfies the required properties.

4. **Output**: The function correctly increments the count for each valid pair and returns the total count at the end.

Given that the logic and implementation appear to be correct and align with the problem statement, there is no apparent issue with the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
