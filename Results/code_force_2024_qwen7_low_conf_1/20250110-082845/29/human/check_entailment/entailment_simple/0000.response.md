Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function correctly returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.
   - The state of the program after executing `func_1` is as expected: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \((a + b) \% (b * \text{GCD}(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The function iterates over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n` and `b` from 1 to `m`.
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), it calls `func_1` to compute the GCD of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{GCD}(a, b)) == 0\) holds true.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count.
   - After iterating through all possible pairs, it returns the final count.

3. **Problem Description Compliance:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly iterates over the specified ranges for `a` and `b`.
   - It correctly uses the GCD calculated by `func_1` to check the given condition.
   - It maintains the required constraints \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - The output is the total count of valid pairs, which matches the requirement in the problem description.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the program accurately follows the problem description and will produce the correct output for any valid input within the specified limits. Therefore, the program is correct.
