Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the program, we need to check if the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solve the given problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The execution summary states that it correctly computes the GCD for any pair of positive integers `a` and `b`. Since the Euclidean algorithm is well-known and proven to be correct, we can assume that `func_1` works as intended.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). For each pair, it checks if the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds. The function uses the GCD calculated by `func_1` to compute \(b * \text{func}_1(a, b)\), which simplifies to \(b * \gcd(a, b)\). The condition essentially checks if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b * \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the problem statement and the example outputs, the logic of checking the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) appears to be correct. This condition ensures that \(a + b\) is indeed a multiple of \(b * \gcd(a, b)\).

Since both functions are designed to handle the problem correctly and the provided execution summaries confirm their correctness, we can conclude that the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
