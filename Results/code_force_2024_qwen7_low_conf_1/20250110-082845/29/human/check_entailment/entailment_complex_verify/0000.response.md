Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the program step by step to verify its correctness.

1. **Euclidean Algorithm (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The loop continues to replace `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` contains the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
   - For each pair, it calculates the GCD using `func_1(a, b)`.
   - It then checks whether the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds.
   - If the condition is true, it increments the `count` variable.
   - After iterating through all pairs, it returns the `count`.

3. **Annotation Analysis**:
   - The annotation correctly describes the state of the program before and after the execution of the functions.
   - The logic of checking the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) is sound because:
     - \(\text{func}_1(a, b)\) correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b`.
     - The condition checks if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \text{gcd}(a, b)\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `a` and `b` are 1 (the smallest possible values) correctly.
   - The program iterates over all possible pairs, ensuring no valid pair is missed.

5. **Performance**:
   - While the nested loops iterate over \(O(n \times m)\) pairs, the GCD computation is efficient due to the Euclidean algorithm.
   - Given the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), the program is likely to perform within acceptable limits for each test case.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic and handles all test cases as expected.
   - No counterexamples were found that would invalidate the program.

Final: **True**
