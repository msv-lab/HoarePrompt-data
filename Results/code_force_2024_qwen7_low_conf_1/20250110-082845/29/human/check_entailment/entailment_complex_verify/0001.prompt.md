You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Output

    4
    14
    153

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count



- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m. The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a` which is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (gcd). It does this by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` contains the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. The function then returns `a` as the gcd. This process handles all valid inputs where `a` and `b` are positive integers within the specified range.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of times the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) evaluates to true for all \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\) and all \(b\) in the range \([1, m]\), `a` is `n`, and `b` is `m`. If the loop does not execute at all, then `n` and `m` are positive integers, `count` is 0, and `a` is 1, `b` is 1.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of times the condition (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0 evaluates to true for all a in the range [1, n] and all b in the range [1, m]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It iterates over all pairs (a, b) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). For each pair, it checks whether the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds. If the condition is true, it increments the `count` variable. After completing the iterations, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the total number of times the condition was satisfied.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part of the code is correct and works as intended.

2. **Main Logic**: The function `func_2` iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. For each pair, it checks whether the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` using the GCD function `func_1`.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition `if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:` is correctly implemented to verify the given condition. This ensures that the pair `(a, b)` satisfies the required properties.

4. **Output**: The function correctly increments the count for each valid pair and returns the total count at the end.

Given that the logic and implementation appear to be correct and align with the problem statement, there is no apparent issue with the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
