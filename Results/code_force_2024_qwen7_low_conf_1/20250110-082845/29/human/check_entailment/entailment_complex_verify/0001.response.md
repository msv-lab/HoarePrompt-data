### Reasoning:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This is accurate and works as intended.

2. **Main Logic**: The function `func_2` iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. For each pair, it checks whether the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` using the GCD function `func_1`.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition `if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:` is correctly implemented. This condition checks if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, we need to ensure that the logic here is correct and that all necessary checks are performed.

4. **Edge Cases**: The original assessment did not explicitly discuss edge cases such as when `b = 1` or when `a` and `b` have specific relationships that might simplify the condition check. We should consider these cases to ensure completeness.

5. **Performance**: The nested loops in `func_2` iterate over all pairs `(a, b)`, resulting in a time complexity of \(O(n \times m)\). Given the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), this approach is efficient enough.

6. **Annotation Analysis**: The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the logic flow of the functions. They confirm that the functions work as expected.

### Evaluation:
- The GCD calculation in `func_1` is correct.
- The main logic in `func_2` is correct and checks the condition properly.
- There are no issues with the implementation that would cause incorrect results based on the given problem description.
- The code handles the problem statement accurately and efficiently.

Given that the code is well-implemented and aligns with the problem requirements, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final: True
