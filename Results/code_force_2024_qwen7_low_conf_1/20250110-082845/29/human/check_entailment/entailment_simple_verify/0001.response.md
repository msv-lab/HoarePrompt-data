### Reasoning:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: The function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. This part of the code is correct and works as intended.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - **Function `func_2`**: The function iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. For each pair, it uses the GCD function `func_1` to compute the GCD of `a` and `b`.
   - **Condition Check**: The condition `if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:` is designed to check whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, this condition might not always hold true for all valid pairs `(a, b)` as defined in the problem statement. Let's analyze it further.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The problem states that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Let's consider the condition more closely:
     - If `a` and `b` are coprime (i.e., `gcd(a, b) = 1`), then the condition simplifies to checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b`. This is generally true for many pairs, but it doesn't cover all possible valid pairs.
     - For non-coprime pairs, the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is more restrictive. Specifically, if `d = gcd(a, b)`, then `a = d * a'` and `b = d * b'` where `gcd(a', b') = 1`. The condition becomes:
       \[
       a + b = d(a' + b')
       \]
       must be a multiple of:
       \[
       b \cdot d = d(b')
       \]
       which simplifies to checking if `a' + b'` is a multiple of `b'`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided example test cases do not cover all edge cases, especially when `a` and `b` have a non-trivial GCD. For instance, consider the case when `a` and `b` are multiples of each other. The condition might fail for such pairs unless handled properly.

5. **Verification with Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the flow and logic of the functions. However, the condition check might still be incorrect due to the misinterpretation of the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is **inaccurate** because the condition check in the main logic might not correctly implement the problem requirements for all cases. Therefore, the program might not produce the correct results for certain input values.

### Final:
**False**
