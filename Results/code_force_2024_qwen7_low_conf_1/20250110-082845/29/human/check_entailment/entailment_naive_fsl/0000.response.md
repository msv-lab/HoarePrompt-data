Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It uses the Euclidean algorithm (`func_1`) to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The main function `func_2` iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and checks if they satisfy the condition `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. This approach ensures that all potential cases are handled, and the program returns the correct count of valid pairs for each test case. Since no counterexample was found where the program fails to meet the requirements, the program is deemed correct.
