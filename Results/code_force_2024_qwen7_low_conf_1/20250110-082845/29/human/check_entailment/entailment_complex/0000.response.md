Reasoning:
- Function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The implementation is standard and correct for all valid inputs where `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- Function `func_2` iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 \leq a \leq n` and `1 \leq b \leq m`. For each pair, it checks whether the condition `(a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` holds. If the condition is met, it increments the counter `count`.
- The overall logic of `func_2` is sound and correctly implements the problem statement. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function will iterate through all required pairs and correctly count the valid ones.
- Both functions handle the input ranges as specified in the problem statement. The function `func_2` ensures that `n` and `m` are within the range `[1, 2*10^6]`, and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed `2*10^6`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct as it adheres to the problem specification and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
