You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m. The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a` which is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (gcd). It does this by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` contains the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. The function then returns `a` as the gcd. This process handles all valid inputs where `a` and `b` are positive integers within the specified range.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of times the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) evaluates to true for all \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\) and all \(b\) in the range \([1, m]\), `a` is `n`, and `b` is `m`. If the loop does not execute at all, then `n` and `m` are positive integers, `count` is 0, and `a` is 1, `b` is 1.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the number of times the condition (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0 evaluates to true for all a in the range [1, n] and all b in the range [1, m]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It iterates over all pairs (a, b) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). For each pair, it checks whether the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds. If the condition is true, it increments the `count` variable. After completing the iterations, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the total number of times the condition was satisfied.
