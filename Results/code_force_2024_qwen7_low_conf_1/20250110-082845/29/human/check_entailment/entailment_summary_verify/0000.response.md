Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Function Summaries**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The function `func_2` iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition using the computed GCD from `func_1`.

2. **Verification of the Assessment**:
   - The original assessment claims that the program correctly implements the solution.
   - The provided function summaries confirm that `func_2` correctly checks the condition for each pair \((a, b)\) and returns the count of valid pairs.
   - There is no indication in the code or the problem statement that would suggest any logical errors or inefficiencies that could lead to incorrect results.

3. **Testing with Example Input**:
   - The example input provided matches the expected output. For instance, in the case of \((10, 8)\), the output is \(14\), which is derived from the pairs \((1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)\).

Given the above points, there is no evidence to challenge the original assessment. The program correctly implements the solution as described by the problem and the provided function summaries.

Final: **True**
