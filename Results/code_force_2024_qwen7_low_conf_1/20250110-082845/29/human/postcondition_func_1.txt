The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It iterates over all pairs (a, b) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). For each pair, it checks whether the condition \((a + b) \% (b * \text{func}_1(a, b)) == 0\) holds. If the condition is true, it increments the `count` variable. After completing the iterations, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the total number of times the condition was satisfied.
