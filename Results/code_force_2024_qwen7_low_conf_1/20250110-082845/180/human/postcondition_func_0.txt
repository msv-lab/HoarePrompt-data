Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)). For each test case, the function evaluates the relationship between these integers and prints one of three outputs: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. Specifically, if \(a < b < c\), it prints 'STAIR'; if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the last processed values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from each test case, and the console will display the appropriate output for each test case.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality in the annotation include:
- The annotation states that `t` is greater than 0 after the loop, but if `t` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their original values.
- The annotation does not mention the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` before entering the loop, which should be considered as part of the initial state.
- The annotation does not explicitly state that the function reads the number of test cases `t` before starting the loop, which is a necessary part of the function's behavior.
