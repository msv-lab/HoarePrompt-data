#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and each test case consists of three integers a, b, c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9. After the loop finishes executing, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their last assigned values from each iteration of the loop, regardless of whether the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b and b > c` were met. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `t` is 0), then `a`, `b`, and `c` will still retain their original values. The console will print either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the conditions evaluated.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)). For each test case, the function evaluates the relationship between these integers and prints one of three outputs: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. Specifically, if \(a < b < c\), it prints 'STAIR'; if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the last processed values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from each test case, and the console will display the appropriate output for each test case.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality in the annotation include:
- The annotation states that `t` is greater than 0 after the loop, but if `t` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their original values.
- The annotation does not mention the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` before entering the loop, which should be considered as part of the initial state.
- The annotation does not explicitly state that the function reads the number of test cases `t` before starting the loop, which is a necessary part of the function's behavior.
