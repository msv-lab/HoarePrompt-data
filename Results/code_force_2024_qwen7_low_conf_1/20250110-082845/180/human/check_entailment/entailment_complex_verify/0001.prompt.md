You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and each test case consists of three integers a, b, c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9. After the loop finishes executing, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their last assigned values from each iteration of the loop, regardless of whether the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b and b > c` were met. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `t` is 0), then `a`, `b`, and `c` will still retain their original values. The console will print either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the conditions evaluated.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)). For each test case, the function evaluates the relationship between these integers and prints one of three outputs: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. Specifically, if \(a < b < c\), it prints 'STAIR'; if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the last processed values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from each test case, and the console will display the appropriate output for each test case.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality in the annotation include:
- The annotation states that `t` is greater than 0 after the loop, but if `t` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their original values.
- The annotation does not mention the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` before entering the loop, which should be considered as part of the initial state.
- The annotation does not explicitly state that the function reads the number of test cases `t` before starting the loop, which is a necessary part of the function's behavior.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and maps them to integers.
3. It checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and prints 'STAIR' if true.
4. It checks the conditions for a peak (`a < b and b > c`) and prints 'PEAK' if true.
5. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program logic appears to be correct and matches the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
