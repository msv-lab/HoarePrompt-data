You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and each test case consists of three integers a, b, c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9. After the loop finishes executing, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their last assigned values from each iteration of the loop, regardless of whether the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b and b > c` were met. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `t` is 0), then `a`, `b`, and `c` will still retain their original values. The console will print either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the conditions evaluated.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic for determining whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Let's break down the logic:

- The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met.
- It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program handles all possible cases correctly. Here’s a summary of the cases:

1. **Stair Case**: If `a < b < c`, the program prints "STAIR".
2. **Peak Case**: If `a < b > c`, the program prints "PEAK".
3. **Neither Stair nor Peak Case**: All other combinations result in "NONE".

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases based on the given conditions, it is correct.
