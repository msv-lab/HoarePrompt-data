Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic for determining whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Let's break down the logic:

- The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met.
- It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program handles all possible cases correctly. Hereâ€™s a summary of the cases:

1. **Stair Case**: If `a < b < c`, the program prints "STAIR".
2. **Peak Case**: If `a < b > c`, the program prints "PEAK".
3. **Neither Stair nor Peak Case**: All other combinations result in "NONE".

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases based on the given conditions, it is correct.
