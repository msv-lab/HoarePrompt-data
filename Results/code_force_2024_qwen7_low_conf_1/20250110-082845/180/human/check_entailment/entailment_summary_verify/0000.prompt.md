You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)). For each test case, the function evaluates the relationship between these integers and prints one of three outputs: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. Specifically, if \(a < b < c\), it prints 'STAIR'; if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the last processed values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from each test case, and the console will display the appropriate output for each test case.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality in the annotation include:
- The annotation states that `t` is greater than 0 after the loop, but if `t` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their original values.
- The annotation does not mention the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` before entering the loop, which should be considered as part of the initial state.
- The annotation does not explicitly state that the function reads the number of test cases `t` before starting the loop, which is a necessary part of the function's behavior.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic for determining whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Let's break down the logic:

- The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met.
- It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program handles all possible cases correctly. Here’s a summary of the cases:

1. **Stair Case**: If `a < b < c`, the program prints "STAIR".
2. **Peak Case**: If `a < b > c`, the program prints "PEAK".
3. **Neither Stair nor Peak Case**: All other combinations result in "NONE".

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases based on the given conditions, it is correct.
