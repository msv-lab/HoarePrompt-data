Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and maps them to integers.
3. It checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and prints 'STAIR' if true.
4. It checks the conditions for a peak (`a < b and b > c`) and prints 'PEAK' if true.
5. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program logic appears to be correct and matches the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
