Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Number of Test Cases (`t`)**:
   - The program correctly reads the first line as an integer `t`, which indicates the number of test cases. This part is handled properly with the statement `t = int(input())`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each of the `t` test cases, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()`. This is correctly mapped to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   
3. **Conditions for Stair and Peak**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is true.
   - It also checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is true.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case, which matches the required output format.

5. **Loop Execution**:
   - The `for` loop iterates `t` times, ensuring that all test cases are processed correctly.
   - After the loop, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their last assigned values from the last iteration, which is consistent with the problem description's expectations.

Since the program accurately implements the logic specified in the problem description and handles all possible inputs within the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9), it is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
