You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')





# Execution Summary:
Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)). For each test case, the function evaluates the relationship between these integers and prints one of three outputs: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. Specifically, if \(a < b < c\), it prints 'STAIR'; if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the last processed values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from each test case, and the console will display the appropriate output for each test case.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality in the annotation include:
- The annotation states that `t` is greater than 0 after the loop, but if `t` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their original values.
- The annotation does not mention the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` before entering the loop, which should be considered as part of the initial state.
- The annotation does not explicitly state that the function reads the number of test cases `t` before starting the loop, which is a necessary part of the function's behavior.
