Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `c` is an integer equal to the third input number. The condition `a < b and b > c` is checked. If the condition is true, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. If the condition is false, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` also remain unchanged.***
