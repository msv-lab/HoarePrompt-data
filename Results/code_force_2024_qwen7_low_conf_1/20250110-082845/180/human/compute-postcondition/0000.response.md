`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is now an integer input from the user, but the specific value of `t` is not known yet. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9**
