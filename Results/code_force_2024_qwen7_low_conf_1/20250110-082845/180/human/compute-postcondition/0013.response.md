The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are that `t` is greater than 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. After executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated based on user input, but the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `c` is an integer equal to the third input number**
