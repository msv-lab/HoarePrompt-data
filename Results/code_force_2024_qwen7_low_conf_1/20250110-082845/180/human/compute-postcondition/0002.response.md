`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which splits the input string into three parts and converts them to integers. The initial conditions for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are that `t` must be greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9. After executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers entered by the user, while `t` remains greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9**
