The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. Since the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are defined as being equal to the first, second, and third input numbers respectively, after the execution of this line, `a`, `b`, and `c` will now hold the actual input values provided by the user.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is greater than 0,
- `a` is an integer equal to the first input number,
- `b` is an integer equal to the second input number,
- `c` is an integer equal to the third input number,

after the execution of the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated to the input values, but the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `c` is an integer equal to the third input number**
