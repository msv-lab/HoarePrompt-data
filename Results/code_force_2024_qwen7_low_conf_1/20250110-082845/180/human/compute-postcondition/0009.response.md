The code `print('NONE')` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints the string 'NONE' to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9; `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9; `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9; and it is the case that `a >= b` or `b <= c`. The console prints 'NONE'.**
