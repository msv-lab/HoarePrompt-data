According to the code, the loop runs `t` times regardless of the conditions within the loop. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `a` is an integer equal to the first input number
- `b` is an integer equal to the second input number
- `c` is an integer equal to the third input number

Since the loop runs `t` times and does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`, only the value of `t` changes. The loop can continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we decrease `t` by 1, so `t` becomes `t - 1` (which is still greater than 0).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `c` is an integer equal to the third input number**
