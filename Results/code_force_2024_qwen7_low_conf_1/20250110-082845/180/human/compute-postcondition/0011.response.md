Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9; `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9; `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9. If `a < b < c`, then 'STAIR' is printed to the console. Otherwise, if `a < b` and `b > c`, then 'PEAK' is printed to the console. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed to the console.***
