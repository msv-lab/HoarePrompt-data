The code `print('PEAK')` does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. It simply prints the string 'PEAK' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9, and it is not the case that a < b < c. Additionally, `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`; 'PEAK' is printed to the console.**
