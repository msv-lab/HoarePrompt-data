The code `print('STAIR')` prints the string 'STAIR' to the console but does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `c` is an integer equal to the third input number**
