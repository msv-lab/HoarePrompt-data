The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but processes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` within each test case. The test case itself is not directly passed as a parameter but is implied to be part of the function's context. The function checks the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are constrained to be between 0 and 9 inclusive. Based on these values, the function returns a specific output.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) and return a specific output based on their values.

Functionality: **The function processes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) and returns a specific output based on their values.**
