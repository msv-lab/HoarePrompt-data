State before the loop starts: `t` is an integer input from the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is an integer input from the user, it must be a positive integer for the loop to run.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9**
