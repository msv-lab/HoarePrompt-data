Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9, `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9, `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9. After the loop finishes executing, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their last assigned values from each iteration of the loop, regardless of whether the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b and b > c` were met. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `t` is 0), then `a`, `b`, and `c` will still retain their original values. The console will print either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the conditions evaluated.**
