The code `print('NONE')` simply prints the string 'NONE' to the console and does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `c` is an integer equal to the third input number**
