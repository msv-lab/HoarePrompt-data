According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- `t` is greater than 0
- `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9
- `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9
- `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and remain greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 1; `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 9; `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 9; `c` is an integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 9**
