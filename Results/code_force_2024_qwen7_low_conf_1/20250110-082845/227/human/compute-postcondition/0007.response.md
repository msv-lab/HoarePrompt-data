Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
  - `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
  - `x` is an input integer.
  - `y` is an input integer.
  - The output is `min(x, y)` and `max(x, y)`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Current Value of `i`:**
   - According to the given information, `i` is `i_prev + 1` at the end of the previous iteration. Since the loop uses `range(t)`, the loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to `t-1`.

2. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be less than `t`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - If the loop is to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - The condition `i < t` must hold true for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `i` will be `i_prev + 2` (since it increases by 1 from `i_prev + 1`).
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
- `t` is still within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is now `i_prev + 2`.
- `x` and `y` remain the same as they were not modified within the loop body.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**
