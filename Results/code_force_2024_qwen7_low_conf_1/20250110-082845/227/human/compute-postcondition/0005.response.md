The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables `x` and `y`. The initial values of `t` and `i` are not affected by this operation. The output is the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`, but since the output itself is not stored in any variable, these values are not part of the final state. The only change is that `x` and `y` now hold the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer**
