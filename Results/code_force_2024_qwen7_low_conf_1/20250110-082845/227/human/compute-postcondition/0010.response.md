Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\); `i` is `t`; for each iteration \(i\) from 1 to \(t\), `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the minimum of `x` and `y` is printed followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.** 

This output state reflects that the loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration, the values of `x` and `y` are determined by the user's input, and the minimum and maximum of these values are printed. After all iterations, the final state of the variables will be as described.
