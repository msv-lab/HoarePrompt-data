The code `print(min(x, y), max(x, y))` prints the minimum and maximum of the two input integers `x` and `y`. It does not change the values of `t`, `x`, or `y`, but it outputs the values of `min(x, y)` and `max(x, y)`. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact numerical values, but we know that `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; the output is min(x, y) and max(x, y)`**
