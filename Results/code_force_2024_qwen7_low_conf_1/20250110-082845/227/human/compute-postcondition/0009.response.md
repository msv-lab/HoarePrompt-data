The code prints the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`. The values of `i` and `t` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the values of `t` and `i`, but `x` and `y` are used in the print function.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\); `i` is `i_prev + 2`; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer; the minimum of `x` and `y` is printed followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.**
