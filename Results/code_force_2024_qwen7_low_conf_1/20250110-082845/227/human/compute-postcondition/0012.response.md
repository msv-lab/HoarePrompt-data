Functionality: **The function processes up to 100 test cases, each containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\) where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\). For each test case, it prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\). After executing the function, the state of the program includes no further test cases to process, and the console output contains the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers from the test cases.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(x = y\), both values are printed as both the minimum and maximum.
- If \(t = 0\), the function will simply read nothing and do nothing else, leaving the program in the initial state with no printed output.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. Therefore, there is no returned value to capture the processed data.
