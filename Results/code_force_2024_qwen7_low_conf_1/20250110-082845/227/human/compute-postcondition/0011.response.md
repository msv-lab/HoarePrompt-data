The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but processes input data within its scope. The input data consists of pairs of integers `x` and `y` where each pair is part of a test case, and each test case is defined such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, and for each test case, `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9`.

However, since the function definition itself does not take any parameters, we need to clarify that the input is derived from an external source (such as a list of test cases passed to the function) and processed within the function.

Given the constraints and the output cases described, the function does not have a direct return value described in the problem statement. We can infer that the function likely returns a result based on the processing of each test case, but without explicit return statements provided, we'll focus on the input constraints and expected behavior.

Functionality: **The function processes pairs of integers `x` and `y` within 100 test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9`, and returns results based on the processing of these test cases.**
