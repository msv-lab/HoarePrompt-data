`x` and `y` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts and converts them to integers. The value of `t` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it within this snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer**
