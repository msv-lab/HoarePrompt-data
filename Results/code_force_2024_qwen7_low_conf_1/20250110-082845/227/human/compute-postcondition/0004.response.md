According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- The output is `min(x, y)` and `max(x, y)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Let's denote the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration as `t_prev`. Since `i` was used in the previous iteration, let's assume `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the loop continues as long as `i < t`, the next value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i_prev + 1` must still be less than `t`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `t` or `i_prev`, we can only say that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `i_prev + 1` and `t` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- The output is still `min(x, y)` and `max(x, y)`.

However, since we don't have the specific values of `t` and `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; the output is `min(x, y)` and `max(x, y)`**
