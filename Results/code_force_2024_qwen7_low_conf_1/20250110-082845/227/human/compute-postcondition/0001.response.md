According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, we know that `t` must be within this range for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
