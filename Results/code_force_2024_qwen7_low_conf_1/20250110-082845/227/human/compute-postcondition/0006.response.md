The code prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. It does not change the values of the variables but prints them. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The output of the print statement will be the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer; the output is `min(x, y) max(x, y)`**
