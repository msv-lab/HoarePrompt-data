The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means that `i` is updated to be `i_prev + 2`, and `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the two integers entered by the user. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\); `i` is `i_prev + 2`; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer**
