### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to process a series of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, \(x\) and \(y\). For each pair, we need to output the minimum value followed by the maximum value.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines a function `func()`.
   - It reads an integer `t`, which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then runs a loop `t` times.
   - Inside the loop, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\) from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into two parts and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
   - It then prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\).

3. **Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - It iterates over each test case and correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values.
   - The program outputs the results in the required format.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the program logic matches the requirements.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly processes the input and outputs the required results for each test case.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
