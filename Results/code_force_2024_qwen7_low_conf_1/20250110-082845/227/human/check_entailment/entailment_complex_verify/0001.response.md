### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to process a series of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, \(x\) and \(y\). For each pair, we need to output the minimum value followed by the maximum value.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines a function `func()`.
   - It reads an integer `t`, which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then runs a loop `t` times.
   - Inside the loop, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\) from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into two parts and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
   - It then prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\).

3. **Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - It iterates over each test case and correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values.
   - The program outputs the results in the required format.

Based on the problem statement and the provided code, the program logic matches the requirements. Let's analyze the annotated version to ensure accuracy:

- **Initial State**: Before entering the function, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- **Loop Execution**: For each test case, the program reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\) and prints the minimum and maximum values.
- **Final State**: After processing all test cases, there are no further test cases to process, and the console output contains the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers from the test cases.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotated version, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly processes the input and outputs the required results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly processes the input and outputs the required results for each test case.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
