You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 100 test cases, each containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\) where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\). For each test case, it prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\). After executing the function, the state of the program includes no further test cases to process, and the console output contains the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers from the test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find and print the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case. The program iterates through the specified number of test cases (`t`), reads pairs of integers `x` and `y`, and prints the minimum and maximum values for each pair. Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program handles all cases correctly without any issues.
