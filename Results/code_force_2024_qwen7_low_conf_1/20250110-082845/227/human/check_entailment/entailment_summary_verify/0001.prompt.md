You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 100 test cases, each containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\) where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\). For each test case, it prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\). After executing the function, the state of the program includes no further test cases to process, and the console output contains the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers from the test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to process a series of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, \(x\) and \(y\). For each pair, we need to output the minimum value followed by the maximum value.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines a function `func()`.
   - It reads an integer `t`, which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then runs a loop `t` times.
   - Inside the loop, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\) from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into two parts and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
   - It then prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\).

3. **Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - It iterates over each test case and correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values.
   - The program outputs the results in the required format.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the program logic matches the requirements.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly processes the input and outputs the required results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
