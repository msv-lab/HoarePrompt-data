Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find and print the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case. The program iterates through the specified number of test cases (`t`), reads pairs of integers `x` and `y`, and prints the minimum and maximum values for each pair. Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program handles all cases correctly without any issues.
