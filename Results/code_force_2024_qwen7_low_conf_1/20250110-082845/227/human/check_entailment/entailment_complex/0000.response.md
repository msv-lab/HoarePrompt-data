Reasoning: 
The annotated program correctly implements the specified problem. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 100. This is handled by the line `t = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then iterates `t` times using a for loop, where in each iteration, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. These integers are expected to be between 0 and 9 inclusive. This is done by `x, y = map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Output Calculation**: For each pair `(x, y)`, the program calculates the minimum and maximum values using the built-in functions `min()` and `max()`, respectively, and prints them in the required format. This is performed by `print(min(x, y), max(x, y))`.

4. **Constraints Satisfaction**: The problem constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) are respected throughout the program.

5. **No Extra State**: After the loop completes, there are no extra operations or states that violate the requirements of the problem statement.

Given that the program accurately follows the problem description and handles all necessary inputs and outputs correctly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
