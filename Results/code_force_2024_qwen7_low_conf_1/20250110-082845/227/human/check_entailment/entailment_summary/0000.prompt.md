You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))





# Execution Summary:
The function processes up to 100 test cases, each containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\) where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\). For each test case, it prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\). After executing the function, the state of the program includes no further test cases to process, and the console output contains the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers from the test cases.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
