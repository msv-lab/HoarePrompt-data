Reasoning: 
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It iterates through each test case using a for loop that runs exactly `t` times.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\) separated by a space using `map(int, input().split())`.
4. It calculates the minimum and maximum of \(x\) and \(y\) using `min(x, y)` and `max(x, y)` respectively.
5. The program prints the result for each test case, which matches the required format.
6. The execution summary indicates that the program successfully processes all test cases and prints the correct minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
