### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Constraints**:
   - The problem requires processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers \( x \) and \( y \).
   - For each test case, the program should output the minimum and maximum of the two integers.
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is between 1 and 100, inclusive.
   - Each integer \( x \) and \( y \) is between 0 and 9, inclusive.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates \( t \) times using a `for` loop.
   - Inside the loop, it reads two integers \( x \) and \( y \) for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It calculates the minimum and maximum of \( x \) and \( y \) using `min(x, y)` and `max(x, y)` respectively.
   - It prints the results in the required format for each test case.

3. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code states that the program initializes `t` as an integer within the specified range and iterates through the test cases.
   - For each iteration, it correctly reads and processes the integers \( x \) and \( y \).
   - It prints the minimum and maximum values as required.

Given the analysis, the program correctly follows the problem specification and constraints. The program handles all possible inputs within the given range without any issues. The original assessment accurately reflects this conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the constraints provided.
