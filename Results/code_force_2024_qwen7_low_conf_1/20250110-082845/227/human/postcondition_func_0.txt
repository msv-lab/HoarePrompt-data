The function processes up to 100 test cases, each containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\) where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\). For each test case, it prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) followed by the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\). After executing the function, the state of the program includes no further test cases to process, and the console output contains the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers from the test cases.
