Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is either `a` or `b` depending on the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` being odd, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character, print(n ^ l, l) is executed and prints the result of `n ^ l` and `l`**
