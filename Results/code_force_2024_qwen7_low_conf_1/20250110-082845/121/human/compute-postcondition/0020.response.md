Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is either `a` or `b` depending on the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` being odd, `l` is yet to be determined, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.***
