The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the input integers separated by a space. The initial states of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged except that `a` and `b` are now assigned these values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and the value of `l` is not yet determined based on the given conditions.**
