Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is `b`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `b` starting from the third character, the output is `b ^ (integer value of bin_b[2:])` followed by `(integer value of bin_b[2:])`. Since the if condition `a == b` is the only condition considered and there is no else part, the overall postcondition remains as the postcondition of the if part.***
