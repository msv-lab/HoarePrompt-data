Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are equal, `final_a` is equal to `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `final_a` (or `n`) starting from the third character. The output is either `final_a ^ l` followed by `l` if `bin(n).count('1')` is odd, or `n ^ l` followed by `l` if `bin(n).count('1')` is even.***
