The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the input values are not specified in the initial state, let's denote the input integers as `x` and `y` respectively. After executing the code, `a` will be assigned the value of `x`, and `b` will be assigned the value of `y`.

Output State: **`a` is `x`, `b` is `y`**
