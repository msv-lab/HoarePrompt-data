The code snippet `print(n ^ l, l)` performs the following operations:
- It calculates the bitwise XOR of `n` and `l`.
- It prints the result of `n ^ l` and `l`.

From the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` and `b` are equal, so `a == b`.
- `final_a` is equal to `a`.
- `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character.

The code does not change the values of `a`, `b`, `final_a`, or `l`. It only prints the results of the operations and does not assign them back to any variable. Therefore, the output state includes the printed values but does not change the preconditions for `a`, `b`, `final_a`, and `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` == `b`, `final_a` == `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character, the output is `n ^ l` followed by `l`.**
