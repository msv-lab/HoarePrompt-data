Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\); `a` and `b` are the next two input integers; `n` is an input integer; `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character; if the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, the output is 'second'; otherwise, the output is 'n ^ l'.***
