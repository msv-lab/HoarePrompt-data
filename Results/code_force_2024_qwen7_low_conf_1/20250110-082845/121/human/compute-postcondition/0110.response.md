The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function might internally use or process `t` and `n` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Given the function signature `def func_1():`, it appears the function does not take any arguments.

Since the function signature does not include parameters but the constraints suggest potential internal usage of `t` and `n`, we can infer the following:

- The function likely processes `t` and `n` internally based on the given constraints.
- There are no explicitly stated return values in the provided output cases.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process integers `t` and `n` according to the specified constraints without taking any external parameters.

Functionality: **The function processes integers `t` and `n` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, but does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return anything based on the provided information.**
