`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the initial state of `n` is overwritten by the new input value. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and is equal to the input value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and is equal to the input value.**
