The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. This changes the values of `a` and `b`, but does not affect the other variables.

- `t` remains an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\).
- `a` and `b` are now the values of the two integers input by the user.
- `n` is either `b` if `a == b`, or `a` if `a != b`.
- `l` is the integer value of `n` in binary representation without the '0b' prefix.
- The print statement outputs `0` and the value of `l`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `n` or `l`. However, we can represent the updated states clearly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `n` is either `b` if `a == b`, or `a` if `a != b`, `l` is the integer value of `n` in binary representation without the '0b' prefix, and the print statement outputs `0` and the value of `l`.**
