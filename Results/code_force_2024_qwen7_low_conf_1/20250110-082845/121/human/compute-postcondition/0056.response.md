The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we are inside. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement affecting the variables directly before this line, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\)
- `a` is the first integer input
- `b` is the second integer input
- `n` is either `b` if `a == b`, or `a` if `a != b`
- `l` is the integer value of `n` in binary representation without the '0b' prefix
- The print statement outputs `0` and the value of `l`

After executing the `break` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state because no changes are made to the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `n` is either `b` if `a == b`, or `a` if `a != b`, `l` is the integer value of `n` in binary representation without the '0b' prefix, and the print statement outputs `0` and the value of `l`.**
