Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, else `n` is `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character, `final_a` is equal to the original value of `a`, the program prints `n ^ l` and `l`**
