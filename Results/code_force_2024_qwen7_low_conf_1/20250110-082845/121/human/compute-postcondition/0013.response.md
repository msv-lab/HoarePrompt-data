Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and the value of `l` is not yet determined based on the given conditions. If `a` equals `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or block. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in other variables.***
