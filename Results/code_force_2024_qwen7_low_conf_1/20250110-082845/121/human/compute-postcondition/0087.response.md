Postcondition: ***`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is `y` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `x` is odd, else `n` is `x`, and `l` is undefined. Since the if condition is `a == b`, if `a` equals `b`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `a` does not equal `b`, the else part does not execute, so the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.***
