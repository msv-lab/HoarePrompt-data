The code snippet `print(n ^ l, l)` involves bitwise XOR operation (`^`) between `n` and `l`. However, there is no definition for the variable `l` in the provided initial state or within the code snippet. Given this, we cannot determine the exact values for `n` and `l` without additional information about `l`.

Since the variable `l` is undefined, we can only state the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` from the initial state, and acknowledge that `l` remains undefined.

Output State: **`a` is `x`, `b` is `y`, `n` is `y` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `x` is odd, else `n` is `x`, `l` is undefined.**
