`n` is XORed with `l`, and the result is printed along with `l`. The value of `l` is derived from the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character. Other variables are not affected. 

Let's denote the binary representation of `n` as `bin_n`. The value of `l` is `bin_n[2:]` interpreted as an integer (excluding the first two characters). The print statement outputs the result of `n ^ l` followed by `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\), `a` and `b` are the next two input integers, `n` is an input integer, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character, print statement outputs 'n ^ l', `l`**
