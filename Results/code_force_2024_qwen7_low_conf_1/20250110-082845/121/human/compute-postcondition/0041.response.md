Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\), `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `n` is an input integer, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character, the output is determined by whether the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd (in which case the output is 'second') or even (in which case the output is `n ^ l`, and the condition `a == b` is true***
