Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). If the count of 1s in the binary representation of `n` is odd, the string 'second' is printed. Otherwise, `l` is an integer equal to the binary representation of `n` (excluding the first two characters "0b") converted back to an integer, which also has an even number of 1s in its binary representation, and `l` is printed.**
