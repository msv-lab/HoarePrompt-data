Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `a` and `b` are updated to the input integers. Regardless of whether `a` equals `b`, `n` is either `a` or `b` depending on the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` being odd; `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character; the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
