`a` and `b` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which converts the input into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged. The exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the user's input.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is `y` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `x` is odd, else `n` is `x`, `l` is undefined**
