The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will work with global variables or input from external sources. However, based on the given constraints, it seems that the function might be expected to process a series of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` and another integer `n`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).

And considering the possible outputs provided in the example answer format, we can infer that the function might return different results based on the values of `t` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` and another integer `n`. It returns different results based on the values of `t` and `n`.**
