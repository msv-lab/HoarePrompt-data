According to the code, the `while True` loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Since there are no conditions provided to break the loop, we need to ensure that the loop can continue to execute.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were observed:
- `data` is a list containing string representations of `t - 1` and `n`, and other elements.
- `index` is `index + 4`.
- `l` is the integer value of the binary string obtained from `bin(n)[3:]`.
- `n` is unchanged.
- The output is `n ^ l` and `l`.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute another iteration unless explicitly stopped. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`data` is a list containing string representations of `t - 1` and `n`, and other elements; `index` is `index + 4`; `l` is the integer value of the binary string obtained from `bin(n)[3:]`; `n` is unchanged; the output is `n ^ l` and `l`.**
