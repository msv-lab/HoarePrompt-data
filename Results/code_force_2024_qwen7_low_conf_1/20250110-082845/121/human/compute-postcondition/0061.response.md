Let's analyze the problem step by step based on the provided loop and the previous iterations' output states.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\).
- `a` and `b` are the next two input integers.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character.
- If the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, the output is 'second'; otherwise, the output is `n ^ l`.

### Code of the Loop
```python
while True:
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == b:
        break
    n = b if bin(a).count('1') & 1 else a
    l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)
    print(n ^ l, l)
```

### Analysis of Iterations
- After 1 iteration: `a` is set to `b`, `n` is `b`, and `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `b` starting from the third character. The output is `b ^ (integer value of bin_b[2:])` followed by `integer value of bin_b[2:]`.
- After 2 iterations: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is either `b` if `a == b`, or `a` if `a != b`, and `l` is the integer value of `n` in binary representation without the '0b' prefix. The print statement outputs `0` and the value of `l`.
- After 3 iterations: We need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues and the final state of the variables.

### Final Iteration Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until `a == b`. Once `a` equals `b`, the loop breaks.
2. **Variables at Break**:
   - When the loop breaks, `a` and `b` will be equal.
   - `n` will be either the last value of `a` (or `b`) depending on the condition inside the loop.
   - `l` will be the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character.

Given these observations, we can conclude the following:

### Output State
- `a` and `b` are equal (let's denote this common value as `final_a`).
- `n` is `final_a`.
- `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `final_a` starting from the third character.
- The output will be `final_a ^ l` followed by `l`.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`a` and `b` are equal, denoted as `final_a`, `n` is `final_a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `final_a` starting from the third character, and the output is `final_a ^ l` followed by `l`.**
