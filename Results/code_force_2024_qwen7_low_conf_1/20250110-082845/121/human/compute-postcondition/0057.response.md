Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `n` is either `b` if `a == b`, or `a` if `a != b`, `l` is the integer value of `n` in binary representation without the '0b' prefix, and the print statement outputs `0` and the value of `l`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part.***
