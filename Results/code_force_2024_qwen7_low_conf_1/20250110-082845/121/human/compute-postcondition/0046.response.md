Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\)
   - `a` is `b`
   - `n` is `b`
   - `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `b` starting from the third character.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   print(n ^ l, l)
   ```

3. In this code, `n ^ l` is computed and printed, followed by `l`. This means:
   - `n` is used in the XOR operation with `l`.
   - `l` is printed directly.

4. Since `n` is equal to `b` and `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `b` starting from the third character, we can proceed with the computation.

5. Let's denote the binary representation of `b` as `bin_b`. The value of `l` would be the integer value of `bin_b[2:]`.

6. The XOR operation `n ^ l` will take place, but since `n` is also `b`, the value of `n ^ l` will be `b ^ (integer value of bin_b[2:])`.

7. The final states after the code execution will be:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged because `a` is `b`, and `b` is unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged because the XOR operation does not modify `n` itself, only its value is used in the print statement.
   - `l` remains unchanged because the value of `l` is determined before the print statement and does not change during the print operation.

8. The output of the print statement will be the result of `n ^ l` followed by the value of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\), `a` is `b`, `n` is `b`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `b` starting from the third character, and the output is `b ^ (integer value of bin_b[2:])` followed by `integer value of bin_b[2:]`.**
