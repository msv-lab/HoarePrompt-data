Output State: **`data` is a list containing string representations of `t - 1` and `n`, and other elements; `index` is `index + 7k` where `k` is the number of iterations; `n` is the final value of `n` after all iterations; `a` and `b` are integers converted from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` respectively for each iteration; `l` is the integer value of the binary string obtained from `bin(n)[3:]`; the value of `n ^ l` and `l` are printed after each iteration; the loop breaks when `a == b`.**
