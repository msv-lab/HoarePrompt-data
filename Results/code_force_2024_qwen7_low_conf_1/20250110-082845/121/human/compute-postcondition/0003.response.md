The code snippet `print('second')` simply prints the string 'second' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `t` or `n`. Therefore, the only change is that the string 'second' is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and is equal to the input value, and the string 'second' is printed to the console.**
