Postcondition: **`data` is a list containing string representations of `t - 1` and `n`, and other elements; `index` is `index + 7`; `l` is the integer value of the binary string obtained from `bin(n)[3:]`; `n` is unchanged; `a` is `int(s1)`; `b` is `int(s2)`. If `a == b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
