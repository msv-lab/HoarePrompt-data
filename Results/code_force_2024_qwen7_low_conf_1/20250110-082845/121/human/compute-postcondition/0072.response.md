The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only indicates that we exit the current loop or block. Since there is no loop or block context provided in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `final_a` is equal to `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `final_a` starting from the third character.**
