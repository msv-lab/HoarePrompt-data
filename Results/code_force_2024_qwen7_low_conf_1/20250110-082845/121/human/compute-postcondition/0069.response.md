Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely as long as it is not explicitly broken out of.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` and `b` are equal.
   - `final_a` is equal to `a`.
   - `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `final_a` starting from the third character.

3. **Loop Execution**: Since the loop is `while True`, we don't need to change any conditions to make it execute. The loop will always execute as long as it is not manually broken out of.

4. **Output Condition**: The output is based on the parity of the number of '1's in the binary representation of `n`.

Given that the loop is `while True`, no adjustments are needed to the states to allow the loop to execute. The loop will continue to execute indefinitely without any specific condition needing to be met.

**State**: **`n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are equal, `final_a` is equal to `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `final_a` starting from the third character.**

The loop will continue to execute as it is a `while True` loop.
