Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing string representations of `t - 1` and `n`, and other elements; `index` is `index + 4`; `l` is 21; `a` and `b` are integers from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` respectively; the states of other variables are not affected; print output is `n ^ l, l`. If `a` equals `b`, then the function continues execution with these conditions. If `a` does not equal `b`, the function also continues execution with these conditions.***
