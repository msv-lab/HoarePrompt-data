Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `final_a` is equal to `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `final_a` starting from the third character. Since the if condition `a == b` is the only condition provided and there is no else part, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
