The code `l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)` converts the binary representation of `n` into an integer, starting from the third character. Since `n` is initially set to `b`, `l` is calculated as the integer value of the binary representation of `b` starting from the third character.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. The initial state is: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\), `a` is `b`, `n` is `b`, and `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character.
2. The code `l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)` calculates `l` by first converting `n` (which is `b`) to its binary representation using `bin(n)`. This results in a string like `'0b...10101'` where `'...'` represents some number of zeros or ones before the last two characters `'10'` (the binary representation of 2).
3. The `[3:]` slice removes the first three characters (`'0b'`), leaving us with the binary representation starting from the third character.
4. The `int(..., 2)` function converts this sliced binary string back to an integer.

Therefore, the new value of `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `b` starting from the third character. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\), `a` is `b`, `n` is `b`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `b` starting from the third character.**
