The code `l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)` converts the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character (skipping '0b') into an integer. Let's analyze this step-by-step.

1. The initial state includes:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\)
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `b` is an input integer
   - `n` is either `b` if `a == b`, or `a` if `a != b`

2. The code `l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)`:
   - Converts `n` to its binary representation using `bin(n)`
   - Slices the string to remove the first two characters ('0b')
   - Converts the resulting string back to an integer using `int(, 2)`

3. The value of `l` will be the integer value of `n` without the '0b' prefix.

Therefore, the value of `l` is the same as the integer value of `n` in binary representation without the '0b' prefix.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is either `b` if `a == b`, or `a` if `a != b`, `l` is the integer value of `n` in binary representation without the '0b' prefix**
