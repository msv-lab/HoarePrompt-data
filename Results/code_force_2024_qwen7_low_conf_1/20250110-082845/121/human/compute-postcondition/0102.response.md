`index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was `index + 5`, so the new value of `index` is now `(index + 5) + 2 = index + 7`. All other variables (`data`, `l`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing string representations of `t - 1` and `n`, and other elements; `index` is `index + 7`; `l` is the integer value of the binary string obtained from `bin(n)[3:]`; `n` is unchanged; `a` is `int(s1)`; `b` is `int(s2)`**
