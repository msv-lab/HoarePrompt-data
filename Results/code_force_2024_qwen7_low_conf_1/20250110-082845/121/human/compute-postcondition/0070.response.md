The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are overwritten by the input values. The values of `n`, `final_a`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `final_a` is equal to `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `final_a` starting from the third character.**
