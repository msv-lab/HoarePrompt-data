Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `a` and `b` are the last two input integers; `n` is either `a` or `b` depending on the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` being odd; `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character; the output is `n ^ l` and `l`.**
