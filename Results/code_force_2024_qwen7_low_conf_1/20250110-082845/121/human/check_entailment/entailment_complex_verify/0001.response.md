### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - The game involves breaking an integer `n` into two integers `p1` and `p2` such that `p1 ^ p2 = n`. The player who cannot make such a move loses.
   - Alice can play either first or second, and she aims to win within 63 moves.

2. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: Alice needs to ensure she always has a valid move until Bob can no longer make a valid move. If `n` is odd (in binary), Alice can always force Bob to play second because any valid split will result in at least one even number.
   - **Implementation Check**:
     - The function checks if `n` is odd by counting the number of '1' bits in its binary representation. If the count is odd, Alice can play second (`print('second')`).
     - If `n` is even, Alice must play first and make a valid split. However, the current implementation of splitting `n` into `n ^ l` and `l` where `l` is derived incorrectly. Specifically, `l` should be calculated to ensure the correct split. The current approach `l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)` and `print(n ^ l, l)` does not guarantee a valid split for all even `n`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The code handles the case where Alice might need to play first or second based on the parity of `n`.
   - The input handling and processing logic seems mostly sound but there are issues with the specific splitting strategy.
   - The condition to stop the loop when `a == b` ensures that the game progresses correctly.

Let's dive deeper into the problematic part of the code:

- The line `l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)` extracts the substring of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character, effectively removing the leading '0b'. This approach does not guarantee a valid split for all even `n`. For example, if `n` is `4` (binary `100`), `l` would be `0`, and `n ^ l` would be `4`, which is not a valid split since `4 ^ 0 = 4`.

A correct approach would be to split `n` into two parts such that one part is `n - 1` and the other part is `1`. This guarantees that `p1 ^ p2 = n` and both parts are non-zero.

### Corrected Implementation:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        if bin(n).count('1') & 1:
            print('second')
        else:
            print('first')
            # Correctly split n into two parts such that p1 ^ p2 = n
            l = n - 1
            print(l, 1)
        
        while True:
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            if a == b:
                break
            n = b if bin(a).count('1') & 1 else a
            # Correctly split n into two parts such that p1 ^ p2 = n
            l = n - 1
            print(l, 1)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the current implementation of splitting `n` into two parts is valid for all cases. The corrected implementation ensures that the split is always valid.

**Final: False**
