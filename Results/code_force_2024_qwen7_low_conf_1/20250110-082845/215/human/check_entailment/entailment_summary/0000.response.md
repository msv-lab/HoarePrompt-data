Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify that it handles all the given conditions correctly and computes the maximum profit as described.

1. **Condition Check**:
   - The first condition `if b <= a` ensures that if the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), then the profit is maximized by selling all buns at the usual price \( a \). This is correct because selling at the usual price would always yield a higher or equal profit compared to any other price.
   - The second condition `elif b - a >= n` ensures that if the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the number of buns \( n \), then selling the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price is optimal. The formula used here correctly calculates the sum of an arithmetic series which is the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the sequence starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1 each time.
   - The third condition `else` covers all other cases. Here, the formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` correctly calculates the profit when the difference between \( b \) and \( a \) is less than \( n \). This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series and adding the usual price for the remaining buns.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by reading \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). It then applies the correct logic to compute the profit and prints the result for each test case.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the correct profit for each test case as per the conditions described in the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic for all possible conditions and accurately computes the profit for each test case, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
