### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For each test case, the program needs to calculate the maximum profit Bob can get by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion rules.
   - The program takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by individual test cases with `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Rules**:
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq \min(n, b) \).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at prices \( b, b-1, b-2, \ldots, b-k+1 \).
   - The remaining \( n-k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If \( b \leq a \), Bob should not change the usual price, so the profit is \( n \times a \).
   - If \( b - a < n \), it's more profitable to sell all buns at the modified prices.
   - Otherwise, a mix of the two pricing strategies might maximize profit.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly checks if \( b \leq a \). If true, it prints \( n \times a \).
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where \( b - a \geq n \), using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers adjusted for the starting point.
   - For the general case, it calculates the mixed pricing strategy correctly by splitting the summation into parts and combining them.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like \( b = a \) and \( b - a \geq n \) appropriately.
   - It uses integer division correctly for the summation formulas.

Given the analysis, the program appears to cover all necessary scenarios and correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit.
