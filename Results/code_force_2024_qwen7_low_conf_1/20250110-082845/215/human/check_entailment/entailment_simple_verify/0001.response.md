### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` and applies the logic to determine the maximum profit based on the given conditions.

2. **Promotion Rules**:
   - The program correctly identifies the conditions for different pricing strategies:
     - If `b <= a`, the usual price remains unchanged, and the total profit is `n * a`.
     - If `b - a >= n`, selling all buns at the modified prices results in the highest profit due to the arithmetic progression sum.
     - Otherwise, a combination of the modified and usual prices is considered.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` correctly calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` to `b-n+1`.
   - The formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` correctly combines the sum of the modified prices and the usual price for the remaining buns.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `b <= a` and `b - a >= n` correctly.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the general case formula:
     - The expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` assumes that `(b - a)` is even. This assumption can lead to incorrect results when `(b - a)` is odd.

5. **General Case**:
   - The general case formula should handle both even and odd values of `(b - a)` properly. The current implementation might fail when `(b - a)` is odd because the division and multiplication might not yield the correct integer result.

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where `b <= a` and `b - a >= n`.
- However, the general case formula does not account for the integer division and multiplication issues when `(b - a)` is odd, leading to potential incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the potential issue with the general case formula, the program is not fully correct as it might produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

**Final: False**
