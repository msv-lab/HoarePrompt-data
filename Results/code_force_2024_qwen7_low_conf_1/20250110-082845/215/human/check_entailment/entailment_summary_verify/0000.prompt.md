You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), where \( n \) represents the number of buns, \( a \) is the usual price of a bun, and \( b \) is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. For each test case, the function calculates the total cost for \( n \) buns under the following conditions:
- If \( b \) is less than or equal to \( a \), the total cost is \( n \times a \).
- If \( b \) is greater than \( a \) and the difference between \( b \) and \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( n \), the total cost is calculated using the formula \( \text{int}((2 \times b - n + 1) \times n / 2) \).
- Otherwise, the total cost is calculated using the formula \( \text{int}((b - a) / 2 \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n) \).

The function reads \( t \) test cases from the input, processes each one according to the conditions described, and prints the total cost for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has processed all test cases and printed the total cost for each one, with the last printed value being the result of the last condition met during the loop iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for cases where `b` is between `a` and `n`. 

Consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 8`
- Expected output: To maximize profit, Bob should sell the first two buns at prices 8 and 7, and the last bun at price 5. The total profit should be `8 + 7 + 5 = 20`.

However, the program's logic does not account for this scenario properly. Let's break down the current logic:
- If `b <= a`, it prints `n * a`, which is correct.
- If `b - a >= n`, it prints `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`, which is also correct.
- If `b - a < n`, the formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` does not cover all scenarios correctly. For instance, in the example above, the formula would yield `2 * (8 - 5) * (8 - 5 + 1) / 2 + 5 * 3 = 2 * 3 * 4 / 2 + 15 = 12 + 15 = 27`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly compute the maximum profit for all potential cases.
