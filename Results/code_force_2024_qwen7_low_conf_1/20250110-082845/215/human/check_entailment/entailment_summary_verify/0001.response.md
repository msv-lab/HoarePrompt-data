### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The program processes multiple test cases, each with three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
   - The program aims to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion rules.

2. **Promotion Rules**:
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq \min(n, b) \).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at prices \( b, b-1, b-2, \ldots, b-k+1 \).
   - The remaining \( n-k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If \( b \leq a \), the program correctly prints \( n \times a \) because it makes no sense to modify the price when it is already higher or equal.
   - If \( b - a < n \), the program correctly uses the formula \( \text{int}((2 \times b - n + 1) \times n / 2) \) to calculate the total cost for selling all buns at modified prices.
   - Otherwise, the program uses the formula \( \text{int}((b - a) / 2 \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n) \) to split the sales into modified and usual prices.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly checks if \( b \leq a \) and prints \( n \times a \) if true.
   - It correctly handles the scenario where \( b - a < n \) and calculates the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers adjusted for the starting point.
   - For the general case, the program calculates the mixed pricing strategy correctly by splitting the summation into parts and combining them.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like \( b = a \) and \( b - a \geq n \) appropriately.
   - It uses integer division correctly for the summation formulas.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula used in the general case. Let's re-evaluate the general case formula:

- The formula \( \text{int}((b - a) / 2 \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n) \) assumes that the buns are split evenly between the modified and usual prices. However, this might not always be the optimal split.

Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- For \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 9 \), the program calculates the profit as \( \text{int}((9 - 5) / 2 \times (9 - 5 + 1) + 5 \times 5) \).
- This simplifies to \( \text{int}(4 / 2 \times 5 + 25) = \text{int}(10 + 25) = 35 \).

This matches the expected output for this case. But let's consider another example:
- For \( n = 6 \), \( a = 10 \), and \( b = 11 \), the program calculates the profit as \( \text{int}((11 - 10) / 2 \times (11 - 10 + 1) + 10 \times 6) \).
- This simplifies to \( \text{int}(1 / 2 \times 2 + 60) = \text{int}(1 + 60) = 61 \).

However, the optimal strategy here would be to sell the first 5 buns at 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 and the last bun at 10, resulting in a profit of \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 10 = 55 \).

The program does not always find the optimal split, especially when \( b - a \) is small compared to \( n \).

### Correctness:
Given the issues found in the general case formula, the program does not always find the optimal solution.

**Final: False**
