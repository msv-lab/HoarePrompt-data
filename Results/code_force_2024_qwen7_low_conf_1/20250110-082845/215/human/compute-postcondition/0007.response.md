The code calculates the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` and prints the integer part of the result. Since the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not used in the calculation, they remain unchanged. The only variable affected is the one that holds the result of the expression, which is printed but not stored in any variable.

Let's break down the expression:

- `2 * b - n + 1` is calculated first.
- This result is then multiplied by `n`.
- Finally, the result is divided by `2` and converted to an integer using `int()`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not needed for the calculation, and `t` is not involved in the computation, the output state will only reflect the updated values of `n` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and the output of the expression `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` is printed.**
