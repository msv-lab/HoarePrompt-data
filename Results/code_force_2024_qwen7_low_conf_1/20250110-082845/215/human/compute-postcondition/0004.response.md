The code `print(n * a)` prints the product of `n` and `a`. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or their relationships. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and the current value of `b` is less than or equal to `a`. The value of `n * a` is printed.**
