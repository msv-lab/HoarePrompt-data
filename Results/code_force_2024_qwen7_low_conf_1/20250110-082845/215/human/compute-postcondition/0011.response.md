Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the program prints `n * a`. If `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a >= n`, the program prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. Otherwise, the program prints `a * n`.***
