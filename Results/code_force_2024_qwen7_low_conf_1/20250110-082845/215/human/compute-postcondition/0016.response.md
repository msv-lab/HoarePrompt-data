The code calculates and prints the value of the expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. Let's break down the expression:

- `(b - a) / 2` calculates half the difference between `b` and `a`.
- `(b - a + 1)` is the number of terms in the sequence.
- Multiplying these two results gives the sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b-1`.
- Adding `a * n` to this sum.

Since the print function outputs the result of the expression, the value of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged, but the expression's result is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0; `n` is an integer read from input; `a` is an integer read from input; `b` is an integer read from input; the output is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`**
