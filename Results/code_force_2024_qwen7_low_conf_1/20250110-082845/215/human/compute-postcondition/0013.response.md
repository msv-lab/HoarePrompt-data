The code snippet reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged because it was not affected by the code.

- The value of `t` is still an input integer greater than 0.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0; `n` is an integer read from input; `a` is an integer read from input; `b` is an integer read from input**
