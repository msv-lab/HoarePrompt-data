The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer before assigning them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are set based on user input, their specific values are not known until the input is provided. However, we can state that these variables now hold integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from user input, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input**
