The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state had `t` as an input integer greater than 0. After executing the code, `t` remains unchanged, while `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
