The code snippet prints the value of the expression `(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))`. This expression is calculated using the values of `b` and `n`, but it does not assign the result back to any variable; it only prints the result. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0; `n` is an integer read from input; `a` is an integer read from input; `b` is an integer read from input; the printed value is int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)**
