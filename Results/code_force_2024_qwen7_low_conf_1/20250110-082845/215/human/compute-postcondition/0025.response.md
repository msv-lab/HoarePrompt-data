Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b` are integers from user input. If `b <= a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is the integer value of \((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\). Otherwise, the original values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.***
