Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer greater than 0; `n` is an integer read from input; `a` is an integer read from input; `b` is an integer read from input. If `b <= a`, the program prints `n * a`. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the printed value is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. If `b - a` is less than `n`, the printed value is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`***
