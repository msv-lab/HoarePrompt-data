The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context and constraints given, it appears the function should process inputs through some form of input mechanism (e.g., reading from stdin) rather than being called with arguments directly. The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

For each test case:
- `n` is the number of buns, a positive integer.
- `a` is the usual price of a bun.
- `b` is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

The function's output for each test case is not explicitly defined in the given information, but typically, such functions might print or return the result of a calculation based on these inputs.

Given the constraints and the typical nature of such problems, the function likely calculates and returns (or prints) the total cost for all buns considering the special pricing for the first bun.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates the total cost for \( n \) buns with the first bun priced at \( b \) and the remaining \( n-1 \) buns priced at \( a \).**
