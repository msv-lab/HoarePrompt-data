Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0. For each iteration, `n` is an integer read from input, `a` is an integer read from input, and `b` is an integer read from input. After all iterations, the last printed value is determined based on the following conditions:
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the last printed value is `n * a`.
- If `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the last printed value is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2).
- Otherwise, the last printed value is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each iteration do not affect the final printed value unless they are used in the conditions above. The final printed value is the result of the last condition met during the loop iterations.**
