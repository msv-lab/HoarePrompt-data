The code calculates and prints a value based on the inputs `a`, `b`, and `n`. Specifically, it computes the expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` and prints the result. Since the code only prints the result and does not assign it to any variable, none of the existing variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) are changed. They retain their initial states as integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from user input, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input**
