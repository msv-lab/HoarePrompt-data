The code calculates and prints the value of the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`. Since `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the term `(b - a)` will be non-positive. However, since `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the term `(b - a)` will be non-positive, and in particular, it will be zero when `b == a`. The output of the print statement will be the value of the entire expression.

Given that `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the term `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` will be zero because `(b - a)` is zero or negative. Thus, the expression simplifies to `a * n`.

Therefore, the value printed is `a * n`. No other variables are affected by this code. The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `b` is less than or equal to `a`; the output is `a * n`.**
