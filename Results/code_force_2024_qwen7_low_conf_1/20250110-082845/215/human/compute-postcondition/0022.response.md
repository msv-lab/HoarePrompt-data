The code prints the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` converted to an integer. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are taken from user input in the initial state, but the code does not assign these values to any variables or change their values. Therefore, the only impact is on the print statement, which outputs the calculated value based on the inputs. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer from user input, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input, and the output is the integer value of \((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\)**
