State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases.
2. For the `for` loop `for _ in range(t):` to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because the `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to `t-1`.
3. The value of `t` being an input integer alone does not guarantee that the loop will execute; it must be specifically checked to be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
