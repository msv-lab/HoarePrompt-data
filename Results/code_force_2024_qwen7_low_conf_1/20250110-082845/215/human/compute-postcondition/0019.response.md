Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer read from input.
   - `a` is an integer read from input.
   - `b` is an integer read from input.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.

3. **What Needs to Be Adjusted for the Next Iteration?**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to decrement `t` by 1 for each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1, so `t` will now be `t - 1`.

4. **Remaining States:**
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body based on the given conditions.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `t` must now be `t - 1`.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` remain the same.

**Final State:**

State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer read from input, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input.**
