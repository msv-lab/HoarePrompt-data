The code updates the value of `curr` to `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `i` is \( n-3 \)
   - `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]` (if `i + 1 < n`)
   - `curr` is `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`
   - `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`
   - `ind1` is the index where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order
   - `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - (n-3)` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, otherwise `ans[i]` is 1.

2. The code `curr = pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` updates the value of `curr` to the new value, which is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`.

Given `i = n-3`, we can substitute `i` with `n-3` in the expression:
- The new value of `curr` is `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`

Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the states of `ind`, `ind1`, and `ans[i]` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `curr` is now `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`
- `ind` remains the maximum of its original value and `ind1`
- `ind1` remains the same
- `ans[i]` remains the same (as it is updated only if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, which is not specified to happen here)

Output State: **`i` is \( n-3 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `curr` is `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is the index where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - (n-3)` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, otherwise `ans[i]` is 1; `curr` is now `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`**
