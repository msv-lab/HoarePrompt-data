The code updates `ind1` to the position where `curr` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain a sorted order using `bisect.bisect_left`. 

- `ind1` is updated to the position where `curr` should be inserted in `pref`.
- The other variables (`i`, `arr`, `curr`, `ind`, `ans`, `ind1`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-3 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `curr` is `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is updated to the position where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - (n-3)` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, otherwise `ans[i]` is 1; `curr` is now `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`**
