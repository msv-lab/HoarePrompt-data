Postcondition: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`, `ind` is the minimum of `-1` and `ind1`, `ans[i]` is `i - ind` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `curr` is calculated as `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `ind1` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`, `ind` is greater than or equal to `0`, `curr` is greater than `0`, and `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `0` with `arr[i]` not equal to `arr[i - 1]`**
