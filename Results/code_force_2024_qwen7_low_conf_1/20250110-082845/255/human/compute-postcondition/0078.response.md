Postcondition: ***`i` is \( n-3 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `curr` is `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is updated to the position where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is 1 if `arr[i] < arr[i+1]`, otherwise `ans[i]` remains as 1; `curr` is now `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`; `ind` is equal to `i` if `arr[i] < arr[i+1]`, otherwise `ind` remains unchanged.***
