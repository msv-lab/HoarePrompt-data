The code snippet `ans[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to each element in the list `ans`. Given the initial state:

- `pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`.
- `ind` is the minimum value between its original value and `ind1`.
- `curr` is greater than 0.
- `ind1` is the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`.
- `ans[i]` is `i - ind` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` if the condition `ind >= 0 and curr > 0` is met.

Since the condition `ind >= 0 and curr > 0` is already met, the values of `pref`, `ind`, `ind1`, and `curr` remain unchanged. The only change is in the list `ans`, where each element `ans[i]` is now 1.

Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`; `ind` is the minimum value between its original value and `ind1`; `curr` is greater than 0; `ind1` is the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`; `ans[i]` is 1 for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
