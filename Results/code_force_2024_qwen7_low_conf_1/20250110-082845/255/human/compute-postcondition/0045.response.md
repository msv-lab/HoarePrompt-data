Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`, `ind` is the minimum value between its original value and `i` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` (or remains unchanged if `i - 1 < 0` or `arr[i] == arr[i - 1]`), `ans[i]` is `i - ind` if `i - 1 >= 0 and arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `ans[i]` remains unchanged otherwise, `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `ind1` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `ind` is the minimum value between its previous value and `i` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `curr` is greater than 0 for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `ans[i]` is updated to 1 if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, otherwise `ans[i]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop, `pref[i]` remains the same as the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`.
- The variable `ind` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and `i` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` (or remains unchanged if `i - 1 < 0` or `arr[i] == arr[i - 1]`).
- The variable `ans[i]` is updated to `i - ind` if `i - 1 >= 0 and arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and remains unchanged otherwise. This means `ans[i]` will only change if the current element is smaller than the previous element, and it will be set to the difference between the current index and the smallest index where the prefix sum minus twice the current element is still less than or equal to the prefix sum at that index.
- The variable `curr` is computed as `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `ind1` is determined by finding the smallest index in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr` using `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`.
- The variable `ind` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `i` if the condition `i - 1 >= 0 and arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met.
- The variable `ans[i]` is updated to 1 if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, otherwise it remains unchanged.

Since the loop iterates over all elements of `arr`, these conditions will be applied for each element in the list.
