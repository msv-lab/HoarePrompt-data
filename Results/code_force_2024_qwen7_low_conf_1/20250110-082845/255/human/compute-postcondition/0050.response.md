The code `ind = max(ind, ind1)` assigns the maximum value between `ind` and `ind1` to `ind`. Since `ind` and `ind1` are the only variables affected, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `curr` is `pref[n-1] + arr[n-1] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum value between `ind` and `ind1`.**
