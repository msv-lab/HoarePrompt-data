The code assigns the value of `min(ans[i], ind - i)` to `ans[i]`. The variables `i`, `curr`, `ind`, and `ind1` are not directly affected by this line of code. The only change is to the `ans` array at index `i`.

Given the precondition:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `curr` is `pref[n-1] + arr[n-1] + 1`
- `ind` is the maximum value between `ind` and `ind1`
- Either `ind` is less than `n` or `curr` is greater than `pref[-1]`

The output state after executing the code will be:
- `ans[i]` is updated to `min(ans[i], ind - i)`
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `curr` is `pref[n-1] + arr[n-1] + 1`, `ind` is the maximum value between `ind` and `ind1`, `ans[i]` is updated to `min(ans[i], ind - i)`.**
