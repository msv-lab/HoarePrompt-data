`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer value input by the user. The `arr` variable is assigned the value of a list created by splitting the input string using `split()` and then converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The initial values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value input by the user such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5; `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**
