The code `ind = max(ind, ind1)` updates the value of `ind` to be the maximum of its current value and `ind1`. Given the initial state, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, and `ind1` is the position where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order. Since `ind` is already defined as the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, updating `ind` to be `max(ind, ind1)` does not change the value of `ind` because `ind` is already the maximum.

Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`i` is \( n-3 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `curr` is `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is updated to the position where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - (n-3)` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, otherwise `ans[i]` is 1; `curr` is now `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`.**
