Postcondition: ***`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`; `ind` is the minimum value between its original value and `ind1`; `curr` is greater than 0; `ind1` is the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`; `ans[i]` is `i - ind` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` if the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met, and `1` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` if the condition `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no operation defined in the else part.***
