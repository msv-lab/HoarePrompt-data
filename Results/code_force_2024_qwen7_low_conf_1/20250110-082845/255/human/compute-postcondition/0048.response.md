The code initializes `curr` with the value of `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n-1` and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, the value of `i` remains `n-1` after the assignment. Therefore, `curr` is assigned the value `pref[n-1] + arr[n-1] + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `curr` is `pref[n-1] + arr[n-1] + 1`**
