The code updates `ans[i]` to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n-2`, `curr` is `pref[n-2] + arr[n-2] + 1`, `ind` is the maximum value between `ind` and `ind1`, if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to `min(ans[i], ind - i)`, additionally, after entering the if condition, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 2]`; `ans[i]` is now `1`.
