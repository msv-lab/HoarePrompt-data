`ind1` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`, which returns the index where `curr` can be inserted to keep `pref` sorted. The values of `i` and `curr` remain unchanged. The output state is: `i` is `n-1`; `curr` is `pref[n-1] + arr[n-1] + 1`; `ind1` is the index where `curr` can be inserted in `pref` to maintain it in sorted order.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `curr` is `pref[n-1] + arr[n-1] + 1`; `ind1` is the index where `curr` can be inserted in `pref` to maintain it in sorted order.**
