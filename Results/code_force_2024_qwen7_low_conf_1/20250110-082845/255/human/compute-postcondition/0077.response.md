The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `ind` being equal to `i`.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-3 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `curr` is `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is updated to the position where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is 1; `curr` is now `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`; `ind` is equal to `i`.**
