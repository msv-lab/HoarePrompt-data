The code assigns the value of `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` to the variable `curr`. The values of `i` and the array elements `arr[i]` and `arr[i+1]` are unchanged from the initial state, but `curr` is now set to the calculated value. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is \( n-2 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]`; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`**
