Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. It calculates and prints a list of results based on specific conditions involving prefix sums and comparisons within the list. Specifically, it computes a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `a` starting from index `i` such that the remaining subarray is non-increasing. If no such subarray can be formed, `ans[i]` is set to -1.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the entire list `a` is already non-increasing, the function correctly sets `ans[i]` to 0 for all `i`.
- If the list `a` consists of identical elements, the function handles this scenario by setting `ans[i]` to 1 when `a[i] < a[i-1]`.

**Actions Performed:**
- Computes the prefix sum array `pref` for the input list `a`.
- Iterates through the list `a` twice to determine the minimum number of elements to remove for each starting index `i` to form a non-increasing subarray.
- Uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find appropriate indices efficiently.
- Updates the `ans` list based on the conditions specified.
- Handles the case where the entire list cannot be made non-increasing by setting `ans[i]` to -1 if it remains `10^9`.

**Final State After Execution:**
- The function prints a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` is either the minimum number of elements to remove to form a non-increasing subarray starting from index `i`, or -1 if it is impossible to do so.
