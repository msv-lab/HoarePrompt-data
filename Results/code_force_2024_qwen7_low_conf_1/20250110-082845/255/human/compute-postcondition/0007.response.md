According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `pref[i]` is updated to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Let's break it down:

1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
2. Therefore, `i` is now `i + 1`.
3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is now `i + 1` and check if this new `i` is still less than `n`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`pref[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is now `i + 1`.** 

To be precise, if the previous `i` was `k`, then the new `i` is `k + 1`. Since the exact initial value of `i` was not given, we can represent it in a general form:

State: **`pref[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is now `i + 1`.** 

If you need a specific instance, assume `i` was `k` before the last iteration, then the state would be:

State: **`pref[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is now `k + 1`.**
