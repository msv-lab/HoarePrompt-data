The code `ans[i] = 1` sets the value of `ans[i]` to 1. Given the initial state, the value of `ans[i]` was updated to 1, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is \( n-2 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]`; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is the index where `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is 1.**
