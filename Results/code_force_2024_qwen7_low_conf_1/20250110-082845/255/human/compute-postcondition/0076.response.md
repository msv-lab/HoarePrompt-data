The code `ans[i] = 1` sets the value of `ans[i]` to 1, overriding any previous condition checks. This means that regardless of the previous conditions involving `ind`, `ind1`, `curr`, and `pref`, the value of `ans[i]` is now explicitly set to 1.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-3 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `curr` is `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is updated to the position where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is 1; `curr` is now `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`.**
