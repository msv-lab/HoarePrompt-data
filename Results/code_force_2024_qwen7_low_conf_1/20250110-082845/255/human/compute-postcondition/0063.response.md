The code `ind = max(ind, ind1)` updates the variable `ind` to be the maximum of its current value and `ind1`. Since `ind` and `ind1` are both variables, their specific values are not provided, so we will keep them as they are. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-2 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]`; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is the index where `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order.**
