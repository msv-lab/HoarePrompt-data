Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1, `i` is no longer `n-1`, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i+1]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to `min(ans[i], ind - i)`, `ind` remains the same, and `ans[i]` is set to `1`. If there is no else part, `ans[i]` is `1` and `ind` is now equal to `i`.***
