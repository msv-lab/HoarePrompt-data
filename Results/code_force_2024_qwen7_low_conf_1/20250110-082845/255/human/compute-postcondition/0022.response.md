The code sets `ind` to the value of `i`. This means the variable `ind` now holds the current value of `i`, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`, `ind` is `i`, `ans[i]` is `1`, `curr` is calculated as `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `ind1` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`, `ind` is greater than or equal to `0`, `curr` is greater than `0`, `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`.**
