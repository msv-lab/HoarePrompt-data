The initial state is as follows:
- `pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`.
- `ind` is `-1`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `10`.

The code snippet is:
```python
curr = pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]
```

Let's analyze this step-by-step:
1. The variable `curr` is assigned the value of `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`. This means that `curr` is updated for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
2. The values of `pref[i]` and `arr[i]` are unchanged by this operation.
3. The value of `ind` remains `-1`.
4. The value of `ans` remains a list of `n` elements each equal to `10`.

Since `i` is not defined in the snippet, it implies that the code might be part of a loop or function where `i` is iterated over the range from 0 to `n-1`. However, the exact values of `pref[i]` and `arr[i]` are not specified, so we can only state the operations performed.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`, `ind` is `-1`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `10`, and `curr` is calculated as `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
