The code updates `ans[i]` to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - i`. Since the value of `ind` is determined by the previous steps and the condition `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]` is not explicitly given, we will assume it holds true for the sake of this calculation.

Let's break down the impact:

1. `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - i`.

Given:
- `i` is \( n-3 \)
- `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`
- `ind1` is updated to the position where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order.
- `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - (n-3)` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, otherwise `ans[i]` is 1.
- `curr` is now `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`.

Since `ind` is the position where `curr` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order and assuming `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, the value of `ind` is relevant for the update of `ans[i]`.

Therefore, `ans[i]` is updated to `min(ans[i], ind - (n-3))`.

Assuming `ind` is the position calculated correctly and `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]` holds true, the value of `ind` is used to update `ans[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-3 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `curr` is `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is updated to the position where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - (n-3)`; `curr` is now `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`.**
