According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
