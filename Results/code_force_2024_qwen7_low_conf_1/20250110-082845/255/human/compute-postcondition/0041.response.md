The code `ans[i] = 1` updates the value of `ans[i]` to 1. Given the initial state:

- `pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`.
- `ind` is the minimum value between its previous value and `ind1`.
- `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`.
- `ind1` is updated to the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`.
- `ans[i]` is updated to `i - ind` for the current value of `i` if `ind >= 0 and curr > 0` is true; otherwise, `ans[i]` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `ind` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `ind1`.

The only change here is that `ans[i]` is explicitly set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their previous descriptions.

Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`; `ind` is the minimum value between its previous value and `ind1`; `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`; `ind1` is updated to the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`; `ans[i]` is 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `ind` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `ind1`.**
