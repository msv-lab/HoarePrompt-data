The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `ind`. The value of `i` can vary depending on the context, but it does not affect the initial values of other variables. The initial values of `ind1`, `curr`, `ind`, and `ans` remain unchanged except for the assignment of `ind`.

Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`; `ind` is `i`; `ind1` is the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`; `curr` is greater than 0; `ans[i]` is 1 for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
