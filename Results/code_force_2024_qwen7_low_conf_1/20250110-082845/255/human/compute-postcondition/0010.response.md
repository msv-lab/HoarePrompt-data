The code `ind = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ind`. This does not affect the values of `pref` or `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is `n`, `ind` is `-1`.

Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is `n`, `ind` is `-1`**
