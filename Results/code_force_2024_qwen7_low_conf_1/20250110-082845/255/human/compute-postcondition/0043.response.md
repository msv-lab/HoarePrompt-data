Postcondition: ***`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`; `ind` is the minimum value between its previous value and `i`; `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`; `ind1` is the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`; `ans[i]` is 1 if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, otherwise `ans[i]` remains unchanged; `i` is `i + 1`.***
