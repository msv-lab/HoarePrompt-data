The code `print(*ans)` simply prints the elements of the list `ans`. Since the list `ans` does not undergo any changes during the execution of this line of code, the values of the elements in `ans` remain the same as they were before the print statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and for each `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `ans[j]` is either `-1` or retains its original value if it was initially set to \(10^9\).**
