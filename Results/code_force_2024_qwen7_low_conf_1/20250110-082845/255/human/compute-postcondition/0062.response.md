`ind1` is assigned the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`. This function returns the index in the sorted list `pref` where the value `curr` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order. Since `curr` is defined as `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `ind1` will be the index where `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` would be inserted in `pref`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is \( n-2 \)
- `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]`
- `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`

The value of `ind1` depends on the position of `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` within the list `pref`. However, without knowing the exact values of `pref`, `i`, `arr`, and `pref[i]`, we can only express `ind1` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-2 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]`; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is the index where `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order.**
