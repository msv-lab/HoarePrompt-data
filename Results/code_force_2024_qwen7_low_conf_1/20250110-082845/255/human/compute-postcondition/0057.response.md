The code sets `ind` to the value of `i`. This impacts the value of `ind` but does not affect the values of `i`, `curr`, `ind1`, `ans`, `pref`, `arr`, or the condition checking.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `curr` is `pref[n-2] + arr[n-2] + 1`, `ind` is the maximum value between `ind` and `ind1`, `ans[i]` is updated to `min(ans[i], ind - i)` if the condition is met, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 2]`; `ans[i]` is `1`, `ind` is now equal to `i`.**
