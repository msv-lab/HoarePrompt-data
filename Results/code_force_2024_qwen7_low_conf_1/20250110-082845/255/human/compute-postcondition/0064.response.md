The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - i`. However, the exact value of `ans[i]` before this operation is not specified in the initial state. The other variables (`i`, `arr`, `curr`, `ind`, `ind1`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-2 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]`; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is the index where `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - i`.**
