Postcondition: ***`i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. If `ans[0]` equals -1, then no change is made to `ans[0]`. Otherwise, there is no specific postcondition mentioned for the if part. Since there is no else part provided, we can only conclude that if `ans[0]` does not equal -1, the postcondition remains undefined for this specific if-else block.***
