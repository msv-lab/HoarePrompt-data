The code creates a new list `pref` which is a copy of the first `n` elements of the list `arr`. The original lists `arr` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `pref` as well as the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value input by the user such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5; `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers; `pref` is a list of the first `n` elements of `arr`.**
