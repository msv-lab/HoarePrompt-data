`pref[i]` is updated to its current value plus the value of `pref[i - 1]`. The value of `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `pref[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`pref[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
