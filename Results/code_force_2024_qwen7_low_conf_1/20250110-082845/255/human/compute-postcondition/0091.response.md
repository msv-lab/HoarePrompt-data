Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and for each `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `ans[j]` is either `-1` or retains its original value if it was initially set to `10^9`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the range `[0, n-1]`. For each iteration, the condition `if ans[i] == 10**9:` checks whether `ans[i]` is `10**9`. If it is, `ans[i]` is set to `-1`.

2. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The loop ensures that any `ans[i]` that was originally `10**9` is now `-1`. Any other value of `ans[i]` remains unchanged.
   - Therefore, for each `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `ans[j]` will either be `-1` or retain its original value if it was not `10**9`.

3. **No Change if Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is `0`), `i` will still be `0`, but since the loop body is not executed, `ans` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop will be as stated above.
