The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, each set to `(10 ** 9)`. The length of the list `ans` is equal to `n`, and the initial values of `i`, `n`, and `ind` are preserved.

Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is `n`, `ind` is `-1`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `10 ** 9`.**
