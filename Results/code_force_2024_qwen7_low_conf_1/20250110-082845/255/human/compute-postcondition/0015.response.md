`ind` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`-1`) and the newly computed value `ind1`. Since `ind1` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`, the updated value of `ind` will be either `-1` (if `ind1` was greater than `-1`) or `ind1` itself.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`, `ind` is the minimum of `-1` and `ind1`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements each equal to `10`, `curr` is calculated as `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `ind1` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`.**
