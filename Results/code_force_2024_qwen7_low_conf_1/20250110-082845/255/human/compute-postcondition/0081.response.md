To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `0`
   - `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]`) is known
   - `curr` is no longer defined
   - `ind1` is no longer defined
   - `ind` is the maximum value among all `ind1` values calculated
   - `ans[i]` is updated to `1` if `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]` for `i + 1 < n`, otherwise `ans[i]` retains its previous value.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each `i` in `range(n)`, meaning the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Analysis of Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, the loop variable `i` must satisfy the condition `0 <= i < n`.
   - Since `i` is initially `0`, we need to ensure that `i` will increment and eventually reach a value less than `n` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **States to Be Adjusted:**
   - `i` should start at `0` and increment during each iteration.
   - `n` should be a positive integer greater than `0` to allow the loop to run at least once.
   - `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]` initially) is known, but its value remains unchanged within the loop, so no adjustment is needed for this specific state.
   - `curr` and `ind1` are not defined initially and are not critical for the loop to start, but their values will be updated during the loop.
   - `ind` is set to the maximum value among all `ind1` values, which is determined during the loop iterations.
   - `ans[i]` is updated based on the comparison `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`, but its initial value does not affect the loop starting condition.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` must start at `0` and increment.
- `n` must be a positive integer greater than `0`.

Thus, the final state required for the loop to execute is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
