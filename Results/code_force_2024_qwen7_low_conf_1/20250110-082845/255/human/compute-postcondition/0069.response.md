Postcondition: ***`i` is \( n-2 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is the index where `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - i` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, otherwise `ans[i]` is 1.***
