Postcondition: ***`i` is \( n-3 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]` (if `i + 1 < n`); `curr` is `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind1` is updated to the position where `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is updated to be 1 if `arr[i] < arr[i+1]`, otherwise `ans[i]` remains as 1; `curr` is now `pref[n-3] + arr[n-3] + 1`.***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks if `i + 1 < n` and `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`.
- If the condition is true, `ans[i]` is set to 1 if `arr[i] < arr[i+1]`, otherwise it remains as 1.
- If the condition is false, there is no change in `ans[i]`.
- Therefore, the overall postcondition is that `ans[i]` is 1 if `arr[i] < arr[i+1]`, and it remains as 1 otherwise, while other variables (`i`, `arr`, `curr`, `ind`, `ind1`) remain as described in the precondition.
