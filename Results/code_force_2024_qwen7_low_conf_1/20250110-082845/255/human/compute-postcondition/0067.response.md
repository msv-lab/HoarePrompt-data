The code assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. The previous value of `ind` was the maximum of its original value and `ind1`. Since `ind1` is the index where `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order, and now `ind` is set to `i`, the new value of `ind` is `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-2 \); `arr[i] \neq arr[i+1]`; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind` is `i`; `ind1` is the index where `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1` would be inserted in `pref` to maintain sorted order; `ans[i]` is 1.**
