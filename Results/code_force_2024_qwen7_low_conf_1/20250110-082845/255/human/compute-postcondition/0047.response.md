Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`: This is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`.
- `ind` is `n`.
- `ans[i]` is `i - ind` if `i - 1 >= 0 and arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `ans[i]` remains unchanged otherwise.
- `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `ind1` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `ind` is the minimum value between its previous value and `i` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `curr` is greater than 0 for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `ans[i]` is updated to 1 if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, otherwise `ans[i]` remains unchanged.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The for loop iterates over the range from `n-1` to `-1` in reverse order. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within this range.

1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `n-1` and goes down to `-1`, the initial value of `i` should be `n-1`.

2. **Condition for Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0 (i.e., `i >= 0`).

3. **States to Adjust:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts from `n-1` and decreases until it reaches `-1`.
   - The state of `ind` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution but may be updated inside the loop.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to `n-1` initially and ensure that `i` remains within the valid range during each iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**
