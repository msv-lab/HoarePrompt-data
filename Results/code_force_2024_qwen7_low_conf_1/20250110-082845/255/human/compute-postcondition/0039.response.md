The code snippet `ans[i] = i - ind` updates the value of `ans[i]` to `i - ind`. This operation does not affect any other variables directly. Let's break down the steps:

1. The value of `ans[i]` is set to `i - ind` based on the given conditions.
2. `i` is incremented by 1.
3. `ind` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `ind1`.

Given these points, the key changes are:
- `ans[i]` is updated to `i - ind`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `ind` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `ind1`.

Since the initial state includes that `ind` is the minimum value between its previous value and `ind1`, and `ind1` is updated to the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`, these relationships still hold true after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`; `ind` is the minimum value between its previous value and `ind1`; `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`; `ind1` is updated to the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`; `ans[i]` is updated to `i - ind` for the current value of `i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `ind` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `ind1`.**
