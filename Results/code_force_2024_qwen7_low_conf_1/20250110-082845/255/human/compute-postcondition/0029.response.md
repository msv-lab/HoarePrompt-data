The code assigns the value of `i - ind` to `ans[i]`. Here, `ind` is the minimum value between its original value and `ind1`, and `curr` is greater than 0. The value of `ind1` is the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`. The `pref` array remains unchanged, as this code only updates the `ans` array.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`; `ind` is the minimum value between its original value and `ind1`; `curr` is greater than `0`; `ind1` is the index of the smallest item in `pref` that is greater than or equal to `curr[i+1]`; `ans[i]` is `i - ind` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
