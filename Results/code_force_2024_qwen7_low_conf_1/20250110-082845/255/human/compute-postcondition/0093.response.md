The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition (`def func_1():`). However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, it seems that the function should process multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers.

The function's behavior is not explicitly defined in the provided output cases, but given the constraints, it implies that the function processes these inputs to produce some form of result or perform some operation.

Functionality: **The function accepts a set of test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers, and processes these inputs to produce some form of result.**
