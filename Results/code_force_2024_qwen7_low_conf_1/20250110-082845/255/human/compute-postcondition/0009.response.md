Output State: **`pref[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is `n`, and `pref` contains the prefix sums of `arr`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, updating each element `pref[i]` to be the sum of all elements from `pref[0]` to `pref[i-1]`.
- After the loop completes, `pref[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` will represent the prefix sum of the list `arr` up to index `i`.
- Specifically, `pref[0]` will be the same as the first element of `arr`, `pref[1]` will be the sum of the first two elements of `arr`, and so on until `pref[n-1]`, which will be the sum of all elements in `arr`.
- Since the loop runs for `n-1` iterations (from `1` to `n-1`), the final value of `i` will be `n`.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `n == 1`), `pref` will be a list of length 1, where `pref[0]` is the only element in the list, and it will be equal to the first element of `arr`.
