According to the code, the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `pref[i]` is updated to be the sum of `pref[i]` (which is now equal to the previous value of `pref[i] + pref[i - 1]`) and `pref[i - 1]`, while `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved**: The main variables involved are `pref[i]` and `pref[i - 1]`.
2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop condition is `i` ranging from `1` to `n-1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `k` is some integer less than `n-1`). Therefore, `i` must be incremented to `k + 1` for the next iteration.
4. **Update `pref` Values**: In the current iteration, `pref[k]` was updated to `pref[k] + pref[k - 1]`.

Given this, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`, and `pref[k]` will remain the same as it was updated in the previous iteration.

So, the state adjustments are:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `pref[i - 1]` (which is `pref[k]` in the previous step) remains unchanged.
- `pref[i]` (which is `pref[k + 1]` in the next step) will be updated to `pref[k + 1] + pref[k]`.

Therefore, the new state should reflect these changes.

State: **`pref[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

To express this clearly:

State: **`pref[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is 2 (assuming `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration)**.

If we want to generalize without knowing the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`pref[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
