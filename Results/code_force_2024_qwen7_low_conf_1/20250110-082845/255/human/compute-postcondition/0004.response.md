The code snippet `pref[i] += pref[i - 1]` updates the value of `pref[i]` to be the sum of `pref[i]` and `pref[i - 1]`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `pref` or `i`. We know that `pref[i]` is being updated by adding `pref[i - 1]` to its current value.

Output State: **`pref[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, while the value of `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged.**
