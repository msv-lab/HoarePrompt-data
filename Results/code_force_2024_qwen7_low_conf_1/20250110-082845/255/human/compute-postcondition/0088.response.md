Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `ans[1]` remains unchanged (which is -1)

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - Since `i` is currently 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop has already executed once.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, making it `i = 2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n`.

4. **Required Adjustments:**
   - To satisfy the condition `i < n`, `i` should be set to 2.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, it remains the same.
   - The value of `ans[1]` remains unchanged as -1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `ans[1]` remains unchanged (which is -1)**
