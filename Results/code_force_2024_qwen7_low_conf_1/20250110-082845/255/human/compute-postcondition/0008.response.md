The code `pref[i] += pref[i - 1]` increments `pref[i]` by the value of `pref[i - 1]`. Based on the initial state, `pref[i]` is already equal to the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, and `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `pref[i]` will be updated to be twice its previous value because it is being incremented by itself.

The value of `i` is updated to `k + 1`.

Output State: **`pref[i]` is now equal to twice the previous value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`, `pref[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and `i` is now `k + 1`.**
