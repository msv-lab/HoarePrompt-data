Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `curr` is `pref[n-1] + arr[n-1] + 1`, `ind` is the maximum value between `ind` and `ind1`. If `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to `min(ans[i], ind - i)`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is no longer `n-1`, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i+1]`***
