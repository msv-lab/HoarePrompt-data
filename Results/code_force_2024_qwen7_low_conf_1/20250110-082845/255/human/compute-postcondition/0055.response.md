Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-2`, `curr` is `pref[n-2] + arr[n-2] + 1`, `ind` is the maximum value between `ind` and `ind1`. If `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to `min(ans[i], ind - i)`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 2]`.***
