You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) â€” the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

        ind1 = bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)
        ind = min(ind, ind1)
        if ind >= 0 and curr > 0:
            ans[i] = i - ind

        ind1 = bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)
        ind = max(ind, ind1)
        if ind < n and curr <= pref[-1]:
            ans[i] = min(ans[i], ind - i)
        if i + 1 < n and arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            if arr[i] < arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i] = 1
                ind = i
    for i in range(n):
        if ans[i] == 10 ** 9:
            ans[i] = -1
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. It calculates and prints a list of results based on specific conditions involving prefix sums and comparisons within the list. Specifically, it computes a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `a` starting from index `i` such that the remaining subarray is non-increasing. If no such subarray can be formed, `ans[i]` is set to -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program aims to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.
2. It processes the slimes in two passes: one from left to right and one from right to left.
3. The `pref` array stores the prefix sums of the slimes' sizes.
4. In the first pass (from left to right):
   - It calculates the `curr` value which represents the total size of slimes before the current slime minus twice the size of the current slime.
   - Uses binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find the position `ind` where the `curr` value would fit.
   - Updates the answer for the current slime based on the distance between the current index and the found position.
   - Special handling is done when a slime is smaller than its left neighbor.
5. In the second pass (from right to left):
   - It calculates a similar `curr` value but includes the current slime itself plus one extra size.
   - Again uses binary search to find the position and updates the answer similarly.
   - Special handling is done when a slime is smaller than its right neighbor.
6. Finally, it converts any remaining large values (indicating it couldn't be eaten) to `-1`.
7. The logic seems to handle the conditions described in the problem statement correctly, although there might be edge cases not explicitly covered in the example.

Given these observations, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
