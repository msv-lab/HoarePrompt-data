You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. It calculates and prints a list of results based on specific conditions involving prefix sums and comparisons within the list. Specifically, it computes a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `a` starting from index `i` such that the remaining subarray is non-increasing. If no such subarray can be formed, `ans[i]` is set to -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the process of slimes eating each other according to the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten using prefix sums and binary search, but this approach does not accurately model the sequence of events where a slime can only eat a neighbor if it is strictly larger.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
3
4
3 2 4 2
3
1 2 3
5
2 2 3 1 1
```

The expected output for the given input should be:
```
2 1 2 1 
1 1 -1 
2 1 -1 1 2 
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
2 1 2 1 
1 1 -1 
2 1 -1 1 2 
```

While the output seems to match the expected results in this specific case, the program's logic is flawed. It incorrectly handles scenarios where multiple slimes can potentially eat each other in sequence, leading to incorrect results for more complex inputs.

For instance, consider the input:
```
4
2 2 3 1
```
The expected output should be:
```
2 1 2 1 
```
But the program might produce incorrect results due to its simplification of the process using prefix sums and binary search, which do not capture the dynamic nature of the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not fully simulate the described process and may produce incorrect results for various inputs.
