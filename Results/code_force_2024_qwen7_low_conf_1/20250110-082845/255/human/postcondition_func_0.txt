The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. It calculates and prints a list of results based on specific conditions involving prefix sums and comparisons within the list. Specifically, it computes a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `a` starting from index `i` such that the remaining subarray is non-increasing. If no such subarray can be formed, `ans[i]` is set to -1.
