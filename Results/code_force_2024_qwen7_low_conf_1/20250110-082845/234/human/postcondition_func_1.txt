The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input an integer. The function then returns this integer. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does not contain any missing functionality beyond what is described. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned an integer input from the user.
