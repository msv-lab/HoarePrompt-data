Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires us to check if a given sequence of operations can be derived from some permutation and calculate the number of valid permutations that could lead to those operations.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()`: Reads `q` pairs of integers from the input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads an integer from the input.
   - `func_3()`: Reads `q` pairs of integers from the input.
   - `func_4()`: Reads a string from the input.
   
2. **Construction of Doubly Linked List:**
   - The function `func_5()` constructs a doubly linked list based on the values of `l` and `r`.
   - Each node in the linked list represents a value from the permutation, and the structure helps in determining the sequence of splits.

3. **Processing the Linked List:**
   - The linked list is traversed to collect the sequence of nodes in the order they would appear after performing the operations.
   - Segments are updated to keep track of how many times each segment is involved in the operations.

4. **Calculating the Number of Valid Permutations:**
   - The final calculation involves counting how many times each segment is involved in the operations and using this information to compute the number of valid permutations.

### Verification:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The functions handle the input correctly by reading the necessary values and converting them to the appropriate types.

- **Linked List Construction:**
  - The linked list is constructed correctly based on the given values of `l` and `r`. Each node in the linked list represents a value from the permutation, and the structure ensures that the operations can be traced back.

- **Traversing the Linked List:**
  - The traversal logic correctly identifies the sequence of nodes and updates the segments accordingly.

- **Final Calculation:**
  - The final calculation step correctly uses the information from the segments to determine the number of valid permutations. The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Given that the code logically follows the problem statement and performs all necessary steps correctly, the program is designed to solve the problem accurately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
