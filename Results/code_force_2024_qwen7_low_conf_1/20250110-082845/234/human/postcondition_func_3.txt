The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters and instead reads a single line of input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns it as a string. The function does not use the parameters `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` mentioned in the annotations. There are no actions performed using these parameters within the function. This implies that the function is designed to read user input and process it without any external inputs or lists as described in the annotations. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the user's input as a string, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
