Let's break down the given problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The variable `i` is equal to `nodes[i].le.v`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `while nodes[i].le:`.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `nodes[i].le` must evaluate to `True`.
   - This means that `nodes[i].le` should be non-null (or `True` in the context of a boolean check).

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `nodes[i].le` must be non-null for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `nodes[i].le` is not `None` after the current iteration.
   - Given that `i` is already set to `nodes[i].le.v`, the next iteration would use this new value of `i` to check `nodes[i].le`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `nodes[i].le` is non-null for the next iteration.

5. **Final State**:
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration is `i` is equal to `nodes[i].le.v`.
   - To proceed to the next iteration, we need to ensure that `nodes[i].le` is non-null.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `nodes[i].le` must be non-null.

**Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `nodes[i].le.v` and `nodes[i].le` must be non-null**
