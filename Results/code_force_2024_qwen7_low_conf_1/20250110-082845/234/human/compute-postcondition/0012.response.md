`le.ri, ri.le` is assigned the values of `ri` and `le` respectively. This means `le.next` (which is `le.ri`) is set to `ri` and `ri.prev` (which is `ri.le`) is set to `le`. The `le` node's next pointer now points to `ri`, and the `ri` node's previous pointer now points to `le`.

- The `nodes` list remains unchanged.
- The `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` variables remain unchanged.
- The `le` variable is updated to point to `ri` via its `next` attribute.
- The `ri` variable is updated to point to `le` via its `prev` attribute.

Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for `nodes[r[i]]` which is a `ListNode` with value `r[i]`, `n` is a positive integer, `q` must be a positive integer such that `1 ≤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`, `le` is `nodes[l[i]]` and now `le.next` is `ri`, `ri` is a `ListNode` with value `r[i]` and now `ri.prev` is `le`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for `nodes[r[i]]` which is a `ListNode` with value `r[i]`, `n` is a positive integer, `q` must be a positive integer such that `1 ≤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`, `le` is `nodes[l[i]]` and now `le.next` is `ri`, `ri` is a `ListNode` with value `r[i]` and now `ri.prev` is `le`.**
