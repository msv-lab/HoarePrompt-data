Postcondition: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for `nodes[r[i]]` which is a `ListNode` with value `r[i]`, `n` is a positive integer, `q` must be a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`, `le` is `nodes[l[i]]`, `ri` is a `ListNode` with value `r[i]`, `le` is `None`.**
