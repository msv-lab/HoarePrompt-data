The `break` statement is used to exit a loop. In this case, it indicates that the loop that was checking for the condition where `nodes[i].ri` evaluates to `True` and adding values of `i` to the list `a` has terminated. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the loop is exited. The variables `i` and `a` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is the final value of `nodes[i].ri.v` such that `nodes[i].ri` evaluates to `True`, `a` is a list containing repeated values of `i` up to the point where the loop terminates and we break out of the loop.**
