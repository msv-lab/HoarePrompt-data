The code `i = nodes[i].ri.v` updates the value of `i` to `nodes[i].ri.v`. Based on the initial state, `i` was previously equal to `nodes[i].le` when it became `None`, and then `a.append(i)` was executed again, which means `a` now contains this updated value of `i`.

Given that `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null, `nodes[i].ri.v` is a valid value.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`a` contains the value of `i` when `nodes[i].le` became `None`, `i` is now equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`, `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null**.
