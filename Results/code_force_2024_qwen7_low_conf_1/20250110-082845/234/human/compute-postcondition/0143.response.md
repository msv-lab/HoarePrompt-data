`seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is incremented by 1. From the initial state, we know `i` is `i_prev + 2`, but the exact value of `i` is not specified. Also, `q` is greater than 0, and the segment array `seg` is incremented at the index which is the maximum of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is incremented by 1**
