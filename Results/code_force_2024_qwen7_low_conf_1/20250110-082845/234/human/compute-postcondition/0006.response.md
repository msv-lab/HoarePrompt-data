The code assigns the value of `le.ri` to the variable `lri`. From the initial state, we know that `le` is not `None`, but we do not know the exact value of `le` or `le.ri`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `n` is a positive integer, `q` must be a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`, `le` is `nodes[l[i]]`, `ri` is `nodes[r[i]]`, `le` is not `None`, `lri` is `le.ri`.**
