Postcondition: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for `nodes[r[i]]` which is a `ListNode` with value `r[i]`. If `lri` (which is `le.ri`) is not `None`, then `ri.le` is set to `le` and `ri.ri` is set to `lri`. Otherwise, `le.next` is `ri` and `ri.prev` is `le`.**
