Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `a` is `[value of `a` when `nodes[i].le` became `None', current value of `i']`
- `i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`
- `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `nodes[i].ri` is non-null.

### Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - The current value of `i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`.
   - For the loop to continue, `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null.
   
2. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `nodes[i].ri` must remain non-null in the next iteration.
   - This means that the node referenced by `nodes[i].ri` must have a non-null right child (`ri`).

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration is already given as `i` being `nodes[i].ri.v` and `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `nodes[i].ri` still points to a valid node with a non-null right child in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `nodes[i].ri` remains non-null.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is `[value of `a` when `nodes[i].le` became `None', current value of `i']`, `i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null**.

No other states need to be adjusted because the condition for the loop to continue (i.e., `nodes[i].ri` being non-null) is already specified and no additional information changes the loop condition.
