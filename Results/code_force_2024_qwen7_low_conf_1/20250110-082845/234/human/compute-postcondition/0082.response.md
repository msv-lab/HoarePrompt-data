The code appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. The initial state is that `i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v` where `nodes[i].ri` is `True`.

After executing `a.append(i)`, the value of `i` remains unchanged, but the list `a` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v` where `nodes[i].ri` is `True`; `a` is a list containing `[i]`**
