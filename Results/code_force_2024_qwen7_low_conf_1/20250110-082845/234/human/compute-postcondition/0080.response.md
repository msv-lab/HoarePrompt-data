To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list with `i` appended to it.
- `i` is an undefined integer.
- The `while` loop condition is `nodes[i].ri`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list containing `i`.
   - `i` is an undefined integer.
   - `nodes[i].ri` is the condition for the loop.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `nodes[i].ri` is `True`.

3. **Current State:**
   - We don't know the value of `i` or the value of `nodes[i].ri`. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the loop will execute based on the current state alone.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that `nodes[i].ri` evaluates to `True` when the loop starts.
   - Since `i` is undefined, we need to provide a specific value for `i` such that `nodes[i].ri` is `True`.

### Conclusion:
We need to adjust the state such that there exists some value for `i` where `nodes[i].ri` is `True`. Without knowing the exact values or structure of `nodes`, we can only specify that `i` should be chosen such that `nodes[i].ri` is `True`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is a list with `i` appended to it, `i` is defined and `nodes[i].ri` must be `True`**
