Postcondition: ***`total` remains unspecified, `nodes` remains a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for index `l[i]` which contains a `ListNode` with the value `l[i]`, `n` remains a positive integer, `q` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq q < n\), `l` and `r` remain integers, `le` points to the node in `nodes` at index `l[i]`, `ri` points to the node in `nodes` at index `r[i]`, and `rle` remains equal to `ri.le`. If `rle` is not `None`, `le.le` now points to the node pointed to by `rle` and `le.ri` now points to the node pointed to by `ri`. Otherwise, `le.ri` points to the node that was originally at `ri.le` and `ri.le` points to the node that was originally at `le.ri`.***
