`l` and `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_1()`. However, since the exact behavior of `func_1()` is not specified, we can only say that `l` and `r` are both integers returned by `func_1()`. The initial conditions for `n` and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`**
