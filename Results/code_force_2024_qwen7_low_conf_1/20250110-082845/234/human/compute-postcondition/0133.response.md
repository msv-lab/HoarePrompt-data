Postcondition: **`i` is an index in the list `nodes`. If `nodes[i]` is not `None`, then `i` equals `nodes[i].ri.v`, `nodes[i].ri` is non-null, and `a` is a list containing all the values of `i` that were assigned during the loop executions or if statement. If `nodes[i]` is `None`, the condition remains unchanged.**
