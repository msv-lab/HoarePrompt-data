Postcondition: ***`total` remains unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for index `l[i]` and `r[i]`, which reference nodes with values `l[i]` and `r[i]`, respectively. `n` remains a positive integer, `q` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq q < n\), `l` and `r` remain integers, `le` and `ri` now point to nodes that are adjusted based on the condition. Specifically, if `ri` is not `None`, then `le.le` points to the node pointed to by `rle` and `le.ri` points to the node pointed to by `ri`; otherwise, `le.ri` points to the original node at `ri.le` and `ri.le` points to the original node at `le.ri`. `rle` is updated according to the linked list structure or remains `None`.***
