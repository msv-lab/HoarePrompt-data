The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial state is given such that `q` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and depending on the condition, `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is set to `1` or incremented by `1` for every iteration, `ans` is updated to `ans % m`, and `cnt` is `1`.

After executing `cnt += 1`, the value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 from its initial value of `1`, making it `2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, if `nodes[i]` is `True`, then `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is `1`, `ans` is `ans % m`, and `cnt` is `2`. Otherwise, `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is incremented by `1` for every iteration of the loop, `ans` is updated to `ans % m`, and `cnt` is `2`.**
