`lri` is assigned the value of `le.ri`. This means that `lri` now points to the node in `nodes` at index `r[i]`, which was previously stored in `ri`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`total` remains unspecified, `nodes` remains a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `n` remains a positive integer, `q` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq q < n\), `l` and `r` remain integers, `le` points to the node in `nodes` at index `l[i]`, `ri` points to the node in `nodes` at index `r[i]`, `rle` remains unchanged, `lri` points to the node in `nodes` at index `r[i]`.**
