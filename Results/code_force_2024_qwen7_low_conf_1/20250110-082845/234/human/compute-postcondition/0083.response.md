To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `nodes[i].ri` is `True`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v` where `nodes[i].ri` is `True`.
   - `a` is a list containing `[i]`.

3. **Determining the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `nodes[i].ri` must be `True` in the next iteration.
   - Since `nodes[i].ri` is a boolean attribute of an object, it does not change based on the loop body (as no modification is mentioned), the key factor is ensuring that `nodes[i].ri` remains `True` for the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `nodes[i].ri` is `True` in the next iteration. Given that `nodes[i].ri` is already `True` in the current iteration, it will remain `True` unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed to the attributes of `nodes[i].ri` itself because it is guaranteed to be `True` for the next iteration.

5. **Other States**:
   - The values of `i` and `a` do not affect the loop's continuation since they are not part of the loop condition. They are derived from the loop but do not influence the loop's execution directly.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, no adjustments are needed for the states to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v` where `nodes[i].ri` is `True`; `a` is a list containing `[i]`**
