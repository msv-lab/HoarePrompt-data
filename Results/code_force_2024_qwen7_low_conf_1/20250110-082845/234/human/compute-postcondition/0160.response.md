Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`. If `nodes[i]` is `True`, then `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is `1`, `ans` is `1` or `ans % m`, and `cnt` is `cnt + seg[i]` or `2`. Otherwise, `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is incremented by `1` for every iteration of the loop, `ans` is `ans % m`, and `cnt` is `2` or `cnt + 1` depending on whether `nodes[i]` is `True` or `False`.***
