The code `rle = ri.le` assigns the value of `ri.le` to the variable `rle`. Based on the initial state, `ri` is `nodes[r[i]]`, and since `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `ri` is `None`. Therefore, `ri.le` is also `None`. 

So, the variable `rle` is assigned the value `None`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers, `i` is `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < q`, `le` is `nodes[l[i]]`, `ri` is `nodes[r[i]]`, `rle` is `None`**
