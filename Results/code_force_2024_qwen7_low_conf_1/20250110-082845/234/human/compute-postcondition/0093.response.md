According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `nodes[i].val`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `nodes[i].val` is truthy (non-None and non-false in Python).

Right before the loop:
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index from 0 to `n` contains a `ListNode` object or `None`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `nodes[i].val` is truthy when the loop starts. Since `i` is `n + 1`, and `nodes` is of length `n + 1`, `nodes[i]` will be out of bounds and will result in a `None` value, which is falsy.

To allow the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `nodes[n].val` (the last valid index) is truthy.

State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index from 0 to `n` contains a `ListNode` object or `None`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `nodes[n].val` must be truthy**
