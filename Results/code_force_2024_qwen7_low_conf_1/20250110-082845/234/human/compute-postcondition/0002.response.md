The code initializes a list `nodes` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `None`. The variables `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `nodes` list.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`**
