Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - `i` is `nodes[n].val`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `nodes[i].le` is `True`.

3. **Objective:**
   - We need to determine what changes are required in the state so that the loop can execute one more time.

4. **Key Variables:**
   - `nodes`: A list where `nodes[n]` exists.
   - `i`: The value of `nodes[n].val`.

5. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to continue, `nodes[i].le` must be `True`.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `nodes[i].le` must be `True` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is determined by `nodes[n].val`, we need to ensure that `nodes[n].val` points to an index where `nodes[i].le` is `True`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment is `nodes[n].le` must be `True` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is `nodes[n].val`, and `nodes[i].le` must be `True`**
