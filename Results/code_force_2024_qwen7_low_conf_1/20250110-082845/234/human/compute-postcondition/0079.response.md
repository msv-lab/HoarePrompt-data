The code `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. However, the initial value of `a` and `i` is not specified in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined previously, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `i` is appended to `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list with `i` appended to it; `i` is an undefined integer**
