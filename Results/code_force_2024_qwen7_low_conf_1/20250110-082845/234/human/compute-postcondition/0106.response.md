`a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. The value of `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`, which means `i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`. The variable `nodes` and its length remain unchanged, and the list `a` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is `[i, nodes[i].ri.v, i]`, `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`**
