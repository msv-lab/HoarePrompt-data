The code `i = nodes[i].ri.v` updates the value of `i` to the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`. According to the initial state, `i` is already equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`, so this assignment does not change the value of `i`.

Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is `[i, nodes[i].ri.v, i]`, `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`, and `nodes[i].ri` is not `None`.**
