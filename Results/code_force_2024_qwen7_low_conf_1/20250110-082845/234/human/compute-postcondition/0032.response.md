The code `lri = le.ri` assigns the value of `le.ri` to `lri`. According to the initial state, `le` is `nodes[l[i]]`, and since `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `le` and consequently `le.ri` would be `None`. Therefore, `lri` is assigned `None`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers, `i` is `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < q`, `le` is `nodes[l[i]]`, `ri` is `nodes[r[i]]`, `lri` is `None`.**
