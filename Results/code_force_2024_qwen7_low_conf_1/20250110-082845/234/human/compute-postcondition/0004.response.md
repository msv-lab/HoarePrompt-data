The code assigns the values of `nodes[l[i]]` and `nodes[r[i]]` to `le` and `ri` respectively. The values of `nodes`, `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. 

Since the exact values of `l[i]` and `r[i]` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `le` and `ri`. However, we know that `le` and `ri` are elements of the list `nodes` at indices `l[i]` and `r[i]` respectively.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `n` is a positive integer, `q` must be a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`, `le` is `nodes[l[i]]`, `ri` is `nodes[r[i]]`**
