The code `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. From the initial state, we know that `a` is defined as `[i, nodes[i].ri.v, i]`, and `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`. Since `nodes[i].ri` is not `None`, we can infer that `nodes[i].ri.v` is a valid value.

After executing `a.append(i)`, the list `a` will contain the elements `[i, nodes[i].ri.v, i, i]` because the last `i` is appended to the list.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is `[i, nodes[i].ri.v, i, i]`, `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`, and `nodes[i].ri` is not `None`.**
