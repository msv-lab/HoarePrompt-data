The code snippet `n, q = func_3()` calls a function `func_3()` which returns two values and assigns them to `n` and `q`. However, the function `func_3()` is not defined in the provided code, so we cannot determine the exact values that `n` and `q` will take. Given the precondition that `n` and `q` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5`, the output state will reflect that these conditions are maintained.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5`**
