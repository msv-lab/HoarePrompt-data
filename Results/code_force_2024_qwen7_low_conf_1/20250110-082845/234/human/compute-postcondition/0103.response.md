`a` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is updated to `nodes[i].ri.v`. Therefore, the output state is: `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` contains `i` followed by `nodes[i].ri.v`, and `i` is now equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is `[i, nodes[i].ri.v]`, `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`**
