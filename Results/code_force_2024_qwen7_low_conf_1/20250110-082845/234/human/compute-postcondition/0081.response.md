The code `i = nodes[i].ri.v` assigns the value of `nodes[i].ri.v` to `i`. Since the precondition ensures that there exists some value for `i` where `nodes[i].ri` is `True`, the value of `i` will be set to the value of `nodes[i].ri.v` where `nodes[i].ri` is `True`.

Output State: **`i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v` where `nodes[i].ri` is `True`**
