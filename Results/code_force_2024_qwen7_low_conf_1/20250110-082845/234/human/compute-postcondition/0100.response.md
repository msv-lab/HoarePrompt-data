`a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` and `i` is the value that makes `nodes[i].le` false. After executing the code, the value of `i` remains unchanged, but `a` now contains the value of `i`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is the value that makes `nodes[i].le` false, `a` is a list containing `i`.**
