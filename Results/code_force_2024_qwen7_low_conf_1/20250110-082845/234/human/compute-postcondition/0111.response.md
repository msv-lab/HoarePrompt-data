The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block that is a loop or a conditional block. In this case, the `break` statement does not affect the variables `nodes`, `a`, or `i` because it is not within a loop or conditional block that would be exited by this statement. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` contains the sequence of nodes visited until `nodes[i].ri` is `None`, `i` is the last node in the sequence (`nodes[i].ri` is `None`), and the initial value of `i` must have satisfied `nodes[i].le` being false.**
