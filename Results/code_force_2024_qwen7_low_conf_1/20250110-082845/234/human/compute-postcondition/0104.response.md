Let's break down the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step:

### Given State:
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `a` is `[i, nodes[i].ri.v]`.
- `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`.

### While Loop Condition:
```python
while nodes[i].ri:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `nodes[i].ri` is not `None`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[i].ri` must be non-`None`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - We know `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`.
   - This means `nodes[i].ri` is a reference to some object in the `nodes` list.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- Since `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`, we can infer that `nodes[i].ri` is a valid reference (not `None`) because otherwise, `i` would not be equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`.
- To ensure the loop executes again, `nodes[i].ri` must remain a valid reference (i.e., it should not become `None`).

### Conclusion:
- No additional state needs to be modified beyond ensuring `nodes[i].ri` remains non-`None`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is `[i, nodes[i].ri.v]`, `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`, and `nodes[i].ri` must be non-None**
