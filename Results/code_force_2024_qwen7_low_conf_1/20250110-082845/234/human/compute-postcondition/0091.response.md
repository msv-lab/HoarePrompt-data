Postcondition: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index from 0 to `n` contains a `ListNode` object or `None`. If `nodes[i]` evaluates to `True`, then `i` is the final value of `nodes[i].ri.v` and `a` is a list containing repeated values of `i` up to the point where the loop terminates and we break out of the loop. If `nodes[i]` evaluates to `False`, the values of `nodes` and `a` remain unchanged.**
