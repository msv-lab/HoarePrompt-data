`i` is assigned the value of `nodes[i].le.v`. Since `nodes[i].le.v` must be `True` in the initial state, `i` will be set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is `True`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is `True`**
