`nodes[l[i]]` is assigned a `ListNode` object with value `l[i]`. The variable `l[i]` is an element from the list `l`, which is derived from the return value of `func_1()`. The length of the `nodes` list is `n + 1`, and it initially contains `None` values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for `nodes[l[i]]` which is a `ListNode` with value `l[i]`, `n` is a positive integer, `q` must be a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`, `le` is `None`, `ri` is not `None`**
