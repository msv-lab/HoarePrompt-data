`a` appends the value of `i` to itself. Before appending, `a` contains the value of `i` when `nodes[i].le` became `None`, and `i` is now equal to `nodes[i].ri.v` and `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null. After appending, `a` will contain the value of `i` when `nodes[i].le` became `None` followed by the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is `[value of `a` when `nodes[i].le` became `None', current value of `i']`, `i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null**
