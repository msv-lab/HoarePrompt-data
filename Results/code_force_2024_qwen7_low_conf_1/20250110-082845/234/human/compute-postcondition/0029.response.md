Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values. Depending on the condition `le`, `nodes[l[i]]` and `nodes[r[i]]` can either be set as `ListNode` objects with specific relationships defined, or they can retain their previous values where `nodes[r[i]].le` points to `nodes[l[i]]` and `nodes[l[i]].ri` points to `nodes[r[i]]`. `n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes from the if and else parts, ensuring that the final state of the program variables (`total`, `nodes`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `le`, `ri`) is accurately described.
