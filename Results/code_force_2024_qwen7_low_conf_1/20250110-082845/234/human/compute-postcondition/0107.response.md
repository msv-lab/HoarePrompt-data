Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - `a` is `[i, nodes[i].ri.v, i]`.
   - `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`.

2. **While Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `nodes[i].ri`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, the condition `nodes[i].ri` must be true.
   - Given `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`, this means `nodes[i].ri` will be true as long as `nodes[i].ri` is not `None`.

4. **Identify States to Adjust:**
   - We need to ensure that `nodes[i].ri` is not `None` for the loop to continue.
   - The state `i` being equal to `nodes[i].ri.v` already satisfies the condition for the loop to continue.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring `nodes[i].ri` is not `None`.

Therefore, the final state to proceed to the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is `[i, nodes[i].ri.v, i]`, `i` is equal to `nodes[i].ri.v`, and `nodes[i].ri` is not `None`.**
