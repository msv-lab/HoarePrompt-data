The code `rle = ri.le` assigns the value of `ri.le` to the variable `rle`. Given that `ri` is `nodes[r[i]]` and its value is not `None`, `ri.le` will also be a specific value (though its exact value is not specified in the initial state).

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `n` is a positive integer, `q` must be a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`, `le` is `None`, `ri` is `nodes[r[i]]`, and `rle` is `ri.le`.**
