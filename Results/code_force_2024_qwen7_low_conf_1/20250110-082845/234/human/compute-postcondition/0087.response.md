The code `i = nodes[i].ri.v` assigns the value of `nodes[i].ri.v` to `i`. This changes the value of `i` to the value stored in `nodes[i].ri.v`. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is a value of `nodes[i].ri.v`.
- `a` is a list containing `[i, i]`.

After executing the code `i = nodes[i].ri.v`:
- The value of `i` is updated to the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`.
- The list `a` remains `[i, i]` because it was not modified.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`, `a` is a list containing `[i, i]`**
