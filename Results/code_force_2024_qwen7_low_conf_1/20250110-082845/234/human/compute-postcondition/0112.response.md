Postcondition: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`. If `nodes[i]` is not `None`, then `i` is the last node in the sequence where `nodes[i].ri` is `None`, and `nodes[i].le` is `False`, with `i` containing the sequence of nodes visited until `nodes[i].ri` is `None`. If `nodes[i]` is `None`, then the condition remains unchanged.**
