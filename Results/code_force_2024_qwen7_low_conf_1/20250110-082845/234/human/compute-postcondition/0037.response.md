Postcondition: ***`total` remains unspecified, `nodes` remains a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `n` remains a positive integer, `q` remains a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` remain integers, `i` remains `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < q`, `le` points to the node in `nodes` that was previously referenced by `nodes[l[i]]`, `ri` remains `ListNode(r[i])`, `lri` remains `None`. If `lri` is `True`, the linked list structure within `nodes` is modified such that `ri.le` is set to `le` and `ri.ri` is set to `lri`. Otherwise, `le.ri` now points to `ri` and `ri.le` now points to `le`.***
