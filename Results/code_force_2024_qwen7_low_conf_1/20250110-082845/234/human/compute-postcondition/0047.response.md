Postcondition: ***`total` remains unspecified, `nodes` remains a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `n` remains a positive integer, `q` remains a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` remain integers, `i` is updated to `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < q`, `le` is either a `ListNode` with value `l[i]` and its links updated accordingly (`le.le` is `rle`, `le.ri` is `ri`, `rle.ri` is `le`, `ri.le` is `le`) or `le` remains `nodes[l[i]]`, `ri` remains the `nodes[r[i]]` node, and `rle` remains `None`.***

This postcondition covers both cases: when `ri` is truthy and when it is falsy, summarizing the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block.
