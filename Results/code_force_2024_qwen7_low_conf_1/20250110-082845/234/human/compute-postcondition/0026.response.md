The code `nodes[r[i]] = ListNode(r[i])` assigns a new `ListNode` with value `r[i]` to the position `r[i]` in the `nodes` list. The previous value of `nodes[r[i]]` was `None`, and now it is replaced with a `ListNode` having the value `r[i]`.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged:
- `total` is unspecified.
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for `nodes[l[i]]` which is a `ListNode` with value `l[i]`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `q` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ q < n`.
- `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`.
- `le` is `None`.
- `ri` is not `None`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for `nodes[l[i]]` which is a `ListNode` with value `l[i]`, `nodes[r[i]]` is a `ListNode` with value `r[i]`, `n` is a positive integer, `q` must be a positive integer such that `1 ≤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`, `le` is `None`, `ri` is not `None`**
