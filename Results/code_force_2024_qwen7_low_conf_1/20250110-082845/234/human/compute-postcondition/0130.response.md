The code appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `a`, we assume it is an empty list before this operation.

- `i` remains unchanged and holds the value `nodes[i].ri.v`.
- `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null, which remains true.
- `a` is initialized as an empty list and then `i` is appended to it, making `a` contain `[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null, `a` is `[i]`**
