To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the conditions under which the loop continues.

### Given Information:
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- If `nodes[i]` is not `None`, then `i` is the last node in the sequence where `nodes[i].ri` is `None`, and `nodes[i].le` is `False`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, we are currently processing `i = n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: After completing the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since the loop will now process `i = n + 1`, we need to ensure that the condition for `nodes[i]` (which is `nodes[n + 1]` in this case) holds true.

### Final State:
- The condition `nodes[i]` being `None` or not affects whether the loop can proceed further. However, based on the current information, there is no specific condition mentioned for `nodes[n + 1]` other than it being part of the list. 

Thus, the key state to adjust is simply the value of `i`, which should be updated to `n + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, if `nodes[i]` is not `None`, then `i` is the last node in the sequence where `nodes[i].ri` is `None`, and `nodes[i].le` is `False`, with `i` now containing the sequence of nodes visited until `nodes[i].ri` is `None`. If `nodes[i]` is `None`, the condition remains unchanged. The current value of `i` is `n + 1`.**
State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, if `nodes[i]` is not `None`, then `i` is the last node in the sequence where `nodes[i].ri` is `None`, and `nodes[i].le` is `False`, with `i` being `n + 1`. If `nodes[i]` is `None`, the condition remains unchanged.**
