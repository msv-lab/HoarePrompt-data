Postcondition: **`q` is at least 1, `i` is \( n - 2 \). If `nodes[i]` is `True`, then `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is `1`, `ans` is `ans * (cnt + seg[i])` or `ans % m`, and `cnt` is `3`; if `nodes[i]` is `False`, then `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is incremented by `1`, `ans` is `ans * (cnt + 1)` or `ans % m`, and `cnt` is `3` or `cnt + 1` depending on the value of `nodes[i]`.**
