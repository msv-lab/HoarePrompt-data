Postcondition: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for `nodes[l[i]]` which is a `ListNode` with value `l[i]`; `le` is a `ListNode` with value `l[i]`, `le.le` is either `rle` (if `rle` is `True`) or `False` (if `rle` is `False`); `le.ri` is `ri`, and `ri.le` is `le`.**
