Postcondition: ***`q` must be at least 1, `i` is `q`, `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is incremented by 1, `seg` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is `0` except for the element at the index specified by `a[0]`, which is `2`; `ans` is `1`, `cnt` is `0`. The value of `nodes[i]` is `True` since the if condition `(nodes[i])` is true.***
