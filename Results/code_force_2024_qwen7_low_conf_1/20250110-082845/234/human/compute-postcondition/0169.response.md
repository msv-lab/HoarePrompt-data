The function `func_5` accepts four parameters: `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r`. Here, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq q < n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\). `l` is a list of `q` positive integers where \(1 \leq l_i \leq n\), and `r` is a list of `q` positive integers where \(1 \leq r_i \leq n\).

The function returns `ans`, which is the product of \((cnt + seg[i])\) for all iterations where `nodes[i]` is `True` modulo `m`, and `cnt` is the count of iterations where `nodes[i]` is `True`.
