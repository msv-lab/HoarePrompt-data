Output State: **`q` is at least 1, `i` is \( n - 2 \), if `nodes[i]` is `True`, then `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is `1`, `ans` is `ans * (cnt + seg[i])` or `ans % m`, and `cnt` is `2`; otherwise, `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is incremented by `1`, `ans` is `ans * (cnt + 1)` or `ans % m`, and `cnt` is `2`**
