Postcondition: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for `nodes[l[i]]` which is a `ListNode` with value `l[i]`, and `nodes[r[i]]` is a `ListNode` with value `r[i]`; `nodes[l[i]].ri` is now `nodes[r[i]]`; `nodes[r[i]].le` is now `nodes[l[i]]`; `n` is a positive integer; `q` is a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`; `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1()`; `le` is `None`; `ri` is not `None`.**
