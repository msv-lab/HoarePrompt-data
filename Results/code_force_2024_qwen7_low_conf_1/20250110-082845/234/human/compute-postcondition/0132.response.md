The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead exits the loop it is within. Since there is no explicit loop in the given code snippet, the only thing that happens is exiting the implied loop context. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, `nodes[i].ri` must be non-null, `a` is a list containing all the values of `i` that were assigned during the loop executions, and we break out of the implied loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
