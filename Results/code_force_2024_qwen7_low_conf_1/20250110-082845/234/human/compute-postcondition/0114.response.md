Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `nodes[i].le` is `True`.
2. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - If `nodes[i]` is not `None`, then `i` is the last node in the sequence where `nodes[i].ri` is `None` and `nodes[i].le` is `False`.
   - If `nodes[i]` is `None`, the condition remains unchanged.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need `nodes[i].le` to be `True`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that `nodes[i].le` is `True` right before entering the loop. Since `i` is determined based on the conditions given, the only thing we need to adjust is the value of `nodes[i].le`.

Therefore, we need to make sure that `nodes[i].le` is `True` before the loop starts.

**Adjusted State:**
State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `nodes[i].le` must be `True`.**

This ensures that the loop condition `nodes[i].le` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
