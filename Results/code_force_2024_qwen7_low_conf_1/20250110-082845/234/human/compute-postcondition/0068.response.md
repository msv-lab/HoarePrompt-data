Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index from 0 to `n` contains a `ListNode` object or `None`. For each index `i` in the range `l[0]` to `l[q-1]` and `r[0]` to `r[q-1]`, `nodes[l[i]]` and `nodes[r[i]]` are ListNode objects with specific relationships defined. If the loop did not execute at all (i.e., `q == 0`), `nodes` remains a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values. `n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are lists of integers returned by `func_1()`.**
