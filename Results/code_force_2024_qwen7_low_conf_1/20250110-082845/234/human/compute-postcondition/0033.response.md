Let's go through the code step by step:

- The initial state is given as follows:
  - `total` is unspecified
  - `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values
  - `n` is a positive integer
  - `q` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ q < n`
  - `l` and `r` are integers
  - `i` is `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < q`
  - `le` is `nodes[l[i]]`
  - `ri` is `nodes[r[i]]`
  - `lri` is `None`

- The code snippet is:
  ```python
  ri = nodes[r[i]] = ListNode(r[i])
  ```

  This line of code does two things:
  1. It assigns the value `r[i]` to `ri`.
  2. It creates a new `ListNode` object with the value `r[i]` and assigns this object to both `nodes[r[i]]` and `ri`.

Given these steps, we can update the variables as follows:
- The value of `ri` is now `ListNode(r[i])`.
- The value of `nodes[r[i]]` is also now `ListNode(r[i])`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values, `n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are integers, `i` is `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < q`, `le` is `nodes[l[i]]`, `ri` is `ListNode(r[i])`, `lri` is `None`.**
