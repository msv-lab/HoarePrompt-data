`a` is appended with the value of `i`. During each iteration, `nodes[i].le` is checked to be non-null before appending `i` to `a`. Once `nodes[i].le` becomes `None`, the loop terminates. Therefore, the value of `i` that was last appended to `a` is the value when `nodes[i].le` became `None`.

Output State: **`a` contains the value of `i` when `nodes[i].le` became `None`, `i` is equal to the final value of `nodes[i].le.v` such that `nodes[i].le` is `None` or the loop terminates due to `nodes[i].le` becoming `None`, and `nodes[i].le` must be non-null during each iteration before the loop terminates.**
