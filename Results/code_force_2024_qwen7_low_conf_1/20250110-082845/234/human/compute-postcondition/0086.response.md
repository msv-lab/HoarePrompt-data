Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is a value of `nodes[i].ri.v`.
   - `a` is a list containing `[i, i]`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `nodes[i].ri`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `nodes[i].ri` must be true.
   - Since `nodes[i].ri` is a condition that must evaluate to `True` for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `nodes[i].ri` remains `True` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The only state that directly affects the loop condition is `nodes[i].ri`.
   - We need to ensure that `nodes[i].ri` remains `True` for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State**:
   - Since `nodes[i].ri` must remain `True`, no other states need to be adjusted based on the given information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `nodes[i].ri` must remain `True`.

**State**: **`i` is a value of `nodes[i].ri.v`, `a` is a list containing `[i, i]`, and `nodes[i].ri` must remain `True`**
