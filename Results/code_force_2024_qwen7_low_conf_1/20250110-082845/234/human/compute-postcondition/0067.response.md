Postcondition: ***`total` remains unspecified, `nodes` remains a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values except for indices `l[i]` and `r[i]`, which reference nodes with values `l[i]` and `r[i]`, respectively. `n` remains a positive integer, `q` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq q < n\), `l` and `r` remain integers, `le` and `ri` point to nodes adjusted based on the condition. If `le` is not `None`:
- If `lri` is not `None`, `le.ri` points to `ri` and `ri.le` points to `le`.
- Otherwise, `le.ri` points to `ri` and `ri.le` points to `lri`.
Otherwise:
- `le.le` points to the node pointed to by `rle` (or `None` if `rle` is `None`).
- `le.ri` points to the node pointed to by `ri` (or the original node at `ri.le` if `ri` is `None`).
- `ri.le` points to the original node at `le.ri` (or `None` if `le.ri` is `None`).
- `rle` is updated according to the linked list structure or remains `None`.***
