Postcondition: ***`total` remains unspecified, `nodes` remains the same (unchanged), `n` remains a positive integer, `q` remains a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`, `l` and `r` remain integers, `i` is updated to `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < q`, `le` is a `ListNode` with value `l[i]` and its links updated as `le.le` is `rle` and `le.ri` is `ri`, `ri` remains the `nodes[r[i]]` node, `rle` remains `None`, `rle.ri` remains `le`, `ri.le` remains `le`.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after executing the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
