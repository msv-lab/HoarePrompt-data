Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index from 0 to `n` contains a `ListNode` object or `None`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `q` is a positive integer such that `1 â‰¤ q < n`.
- `l` and `r` are lists of integers returned by `func_1()`.
- `a` is an empty list.

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` will take values from 1 to `n` inclusive.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- **Initial Value of `i`**: The variable `i` should start at 1.
- **Value of `n`**: Since the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1`, `n` must be a positive integer to ensure the loop runs at least once.

### Adjusted States
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index from 0 to `n` contains a `ListNode` object or `None`.
- `n` must be a positive integer (since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`).
- `i` must be set to 1 initially.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` where each index from 0 to `n` contains a `ListNode` object or `None`, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is 1**
