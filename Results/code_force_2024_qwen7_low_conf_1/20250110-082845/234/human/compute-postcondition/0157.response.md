`ans` is multiplied by `cnt`. From the initial state, `cnt` is `1`. Therefore, `ans` is effectively doubled (assuming `ans` was initially `1`). The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`q` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, if `nodes[i]` is `True`, then `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is `1`, `ans` is `2`, and `cnt` is `1`. Otherwise, `seg[max(a[i], a[i + 1])]` is incremented by `1` for every iteration of the loop, `ans` is updated to `ans % m`, and `cnt` is `1`.**
