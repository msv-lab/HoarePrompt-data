The function `func_1()` reads a single line of input from the user, expecting `q` pairs of integers, each pair separated by a space. It then splits the input string into individual tokens, converts each token to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. Each pair of integers in the returned list corresponds to elements of lists `l` and `r`. The function assumes that the input format is strictly followed; if the input does not match the expected format, the behavior is undefined. Potential edge cases include incorrect formatting, non-integer values, or an incorrect number of pairs.
