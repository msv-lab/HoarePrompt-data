def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers created by mapping int to the split input, where the input consists of q pairs of integers each pair separated by a space and representing elements of lists l and r
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` reads a single line of input from the user, expecting `q` pairs of integers, each pair separated by a space. It then splits the input string into individual tokens, converts each token to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. Each pair of integers in the returned list corresponds to elements of lists `l` and `r`. The function assumes that the input format is strictly followed; if the input does not match the expected format, the behavior is undefined. Potential edge cases include incorrect formatting, non-integer values, or an incorrect number of pairs.

def func_2():

    #The program returns an integer input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input an integer. The function then returns this integer. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does not contain any missing functionality beyond what is described. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned an integer input from the user.

def func_3():

    #The program returns a map object containing q pairs of integers (each pair corresponds to the split input values), where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ n and 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ q
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the standard input, expecting `n` and `q` followed by `q` pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It then returns a map object containing `q` pairs of integers, where each pair corresponds to the split input values, ensuring that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ n` and `1 ≤ r_i ≤ n` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ q`. The function does not perform any additional processing on the input values beyond splitting and returning them. If the input does not conform to the specified constraints, the behavior is undefined.

def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, which was input by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters and instead reads a single line of input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns it as a string. The function does not use the parameters `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` mentioned in the annotations. There are no actions performed using these parameters within the function. This implies that the function is designed to read user input and process it without any external inputs or lists as described in the annotations. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the user's input as a string, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.

If the loop did not execute at all (i.e., `q == 0`), `nodes` remains a list of length `n + 1` containing `None` values. `n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ q < n`, `l` and `r` are lists of integers returned by `func_1()`.

    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the product of (cnt + seg[i]) for all iterations where nodes[i] is True modulo m, and cnt is the count of iterations where nodes[i] is True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts four parameters: `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r`. Here, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5`, `l` is a list of `q` positive integers, and `r` is another list of `q` positive integers. The function constructs a doubly linked list structure based on the elements in `l` and `r` and updates the `nodes` list accordingly. After constructing the linked list, it traverses the list to identify a sequence of nodes and collects their indices in the list `a`. Then, it updates the `seg` list based on the indices in `a`. Finally, it calculates the product of `(cnt + seg[i])` for all iterations where `nodes[i]` is `True` modulo `m`, where `cnt` is the count of iterations where `nodes[i]` is `True`, and returns this value as `ans`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `q == 0`, the `nodes` list remains unchanged, and the subsequent steps involving `a`, `seg`, and `ans` are skipped.
2. The code assumes that the `ListNode` class is defined elsewhere and has attributes `.v`, `.le`, and `.ri`.
3. The function `func_1()` is called twice to get the `l` and `r` lists, but its implementation is not shown, and no default behavior is specified if `func_1()` returns invalid data.
