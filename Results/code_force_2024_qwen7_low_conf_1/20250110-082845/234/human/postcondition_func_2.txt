The function reads input from the standard input, expecting `n` and `q` followed by `q` pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It then returns a map object containing `q` pairs of integers, where each pair corresponds to the split input values, ensuring that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ n` and `1 ≤ r_i ≤ n` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ q`. The function does not perform any additional processing on the input values beyond splitting and returning them. If the input does not conform to the specified constraints, the behavior is undefined.
