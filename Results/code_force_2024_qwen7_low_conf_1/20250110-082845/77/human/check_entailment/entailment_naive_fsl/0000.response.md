Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum size of Alice's plot when Bob gives her a fountain. Specifically, the function `func_1` used to calculate the additional area Alice gains when given a fountain does not account for the actual constraints and possible configurations of the fountains and the field boundaries.

For instance, consider a simple case where the field is 2x2, and there are 3 fountains at positions (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2). According to the problem statement, the maximum size of Alice's plot without any fountains is 1. When Bob gives Alice the fountain at (1,1), the correct additional area Alice can gain would be 1 (since she can now include this fountain in her path). However, the program incorrectly calculates the additional area using a diagonal distance approach which does not accurately reflect the possible configurations and movements within the grid.

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
