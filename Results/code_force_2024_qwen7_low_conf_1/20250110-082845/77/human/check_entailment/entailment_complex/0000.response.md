### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the maximum of half the absolute difference between the sum of the fountain's coordinates and the sum of the field dimensions incremented by one. The formula used is `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)`.
   - This function handles the edge case where the result of the calculation could be negative by ensuring the returned value is at least zero. This is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the input data and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it correctly calculates \(\alpha\) as \((n \times m + 1) // 2\).
   - It iterates through the list of fountain coordinates and calculates the additional area each fountain contributes using `func_1`. This is done correctly.
   - The function constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains \(\alpha\) and a list of additional areas contributed by the fountains.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each test case as specified.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function assumes valid inputs (e.g., \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), unique fountain positions, etc.). While it does handle some edge cases (like negative results from `func_1`), it does not explicitly validate the input ranges or handle all possible invalid inputs (e.g., non-positive integers for \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(r\), and \(c\)).
   - Despite this, the logic implemented in the function is sound and meets the problem requirements.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The function prints the correct values for \(\alpha\) and the additional areas for each test case as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` implement the required logic correctly and handle the problem constraints appropriately, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
