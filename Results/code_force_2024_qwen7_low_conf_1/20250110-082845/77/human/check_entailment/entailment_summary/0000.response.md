Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible additional area Alice can gain from a single fountain. The logic used is correct for determining the potential additional area a fountain can contribute to Alice's plot.
   - The formula `abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2` correctly identifies how much additional territory a fountain can potentially add based on its position relative to the target cell `(n, 1)`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases. It correctly initializes the value \(\alpha\) as \((n \times m + 1) // 2\), which represents the maximum area Alice can achieve without any fountains. This is a sound approach as it accounts for the best possible split of the grid.
   - It then iterates over the \(k\) fountains, calculating the additional area each can contribute using `func_1`. This is correctly implemented and aligns with the problem statement.
   - The final output for each test case correctly outputs \(\alpha\) followed by the list of additional areas for each fountain.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The code does not explicitly handle invalid inputs such as non-positive integers for \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(r\), and \(c\). However, the problem statement guarantees that these constraints are met, so this omission is acceptable in this context.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program correctly addresses the requirements of the problem. It calculates the maximum area Alice can obtain and the additional area each fountain contributes to this total.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as stated, adhering to the constraints and producing the expected output format.

Correctness: **True**
