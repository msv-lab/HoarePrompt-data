Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the problem and analyze the code.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to find the maximum area Alice can own given the constraints and then adjust this area if Bob gives her one of his fountains.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - The field is an \( n \times m \) rectangle.
   - Alice starts from either the left or top side and moves down or right.
   - Alice owns the part including cell \((n, 1)\).
   - Bob owns the part including cell \((1, m)\).
3. **Fountains**: There are \( k \) fountains, each located at a specific cell \((r_i, c_i)\). Each fountain cannot be on Alice's plot unless Bob gives it to her.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the additional area Alice can gain if she can reach a fountain located at \((r, c)\).
   - The logic used here is:
     - Calculate the "diagonal distance" from the fountain to the cell \((n, 1)\) using \( |r + c - (n + 1)| \).
     - The additional area Alice can gain is half of this distance rounded up, ensuring no negative values.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from stdin and processes each test case.
   - For each test case:
     - Computes the initial maximum area Alice can own without any fountain (\(\alpha\)) as \(\frac{n \times m + 1}{2}\).
     - For each fountain, calculates the additional area Alice can gain if given that fountain using `func_1`.
     - Collects these additional areas and outputs the results.

### Verification:
- The approach for calculating \(\alpha\) is correct because it ensures Alice maximizes her area by starting from the left/top and ending at the designated cells.
- The calculation for the additional area for each fountain is also correct, as it correctly considers the "diagonal distance" and rounds up to ensure Alice gains the maximum possible area for each fountain.

Given that the logic and calculations in the code match the problem requirements, the program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
