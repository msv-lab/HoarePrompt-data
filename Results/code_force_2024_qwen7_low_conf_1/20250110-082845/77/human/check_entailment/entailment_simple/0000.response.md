Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the following points indicate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Calculation of Maximum Possible Size (`alpha`)**:
   - The program correctly calculates the initial maximum possible size of Alice's plot (`alpha`) as \((n * m + 1) // 2\). This part is correct.
   - However, the problem requires determining how giving each fountain to Alice affects the size of her plot. The program does not correctly compute the additional areas (`a_i`) that Alice gains when a fountain is given to her.

2. **Computation of Additional Areas (`a_i`)**:
   - The function `func_1` computes the maximum additional area Alice can gain if she receives a specific fountain. This calculation is based on the formula `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)`.
   - While this function is correctly implemented, it does not account for the fact that giving a fountain to Alice might allow her to claim more territory, which could potentially increase the area beyond the simple subtraction of the fountainâ€™s impact.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the calculated `alpha` and the list of `a_i` values correctly. However, the values of `a_i` should reflect the exact additional area gained by Alice when each fountain is given to her, considering the complex geometry of the field and the movement rules.
   - The program does not consider the actual movement paths and how the addition of a fountain changes these paths, leading to an incorrect computation of `a_i`.

### Example Analysis:
Let's analyze a simple example to illustrate the issue:

- Suppose \( n = 3 \), \( m = 3 \), and \( k = 2 \).
- Fountains are at positions (1, 2) and (2, 3).

The program would calculate:
- Initial \( \alpha = (3 * 3 + 1) // 2 = 5 \).
- For the fountain at (1, 2): \( \text{func\_1}((1, 2), 3, 3) = 1 \).
- For the fountain at (2, 3): \( \text{func\_1}((2, 3), 3, 3) = 1 \).

Thus, the output would be:
```
5
1 1
```

However, this does not account for the fact that giving the fountain at (2, 3) to Alice allows her to claim the cell (2, 1) as well, thus increasing the area by more than just 1. Similarly, the fountain at (1, 2) does not simply add 1 to the area.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to accurately compute the exact additional area Alice gains when a fountain is given to her, leading to incorrect output for certain cases. Therefore, the program is **incorrect** according to the problem description.
