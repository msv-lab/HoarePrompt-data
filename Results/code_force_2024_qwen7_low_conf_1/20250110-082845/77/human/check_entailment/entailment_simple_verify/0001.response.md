Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. We'll focus on the key aspects of the solution:

1. **Objective and Constraints**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the area she can own by moving from the left/top side to the right/bottom side, ending at cell \((n, 1)\) and \((1, m)\) respectively.
   - The additional area Alice can gain from a fountain is calculated using the "diagonal distance" from the fountain to the cell \((n, 1)\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Correctly calculates the additional area Alice can gain from a fountain at \((r, c)\) as \(\text{max}( \left\lfloor \frac{|r + c - (n + 1)|}{2} \right\rfloor, 0)\).
   - This logic ensures that Alice can only gain territory if the fountain is within a certain "reach" from the boundary she needs to pass through to complete her path.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from stdin and processes each test case.
   - Computes \(\alpha\) as \(\frac{n \times m + 1}{2}\), which is the maximum area Alice can own without any fountains.
   - For each fountain, calculates the additional area Alice can gain if given that fountain using `func_1`.
   - Collects these additional areas and outputs the results.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Calculation of \(\alpha\)**:
   - The formula \(\alpha = \frac{n \times m + 1}{2}\) is correct. This ensures Alice owns half of the total area plus one more cell, ensuring she ends at \((n, 1)\) and \((1, m)\).

2. **Additional Area Calculation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the additional area Alice can gain from each fountain. However, we need to verify if this logic fully covers all possible scenarios.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the case where a fountain is very close to the boundary cells. For example, if a fountain is at \((n-1, 1)\), it should not affect Alice's plot since she already owns the cell \((n, 1)\). Similarly, a fountain at \((1, m-1)\) should not affect Alice's plot since she already owns the cell \((1, m)\).

4. **Fountain Distribution**:
   - The program correctly handles the distribution of fountains and calculates the additional areas accurately. Each fountain's impact is considered independently.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and the problem requirements, we confirm that the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum area Alice can own and the additional area she gains from each fountain. The original assessment was accurate.

Final: **True**
