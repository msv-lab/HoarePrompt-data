### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` aims to calculate the additional area Alice can gain by receiving a fountain at position `(r, c)`. The formula used is `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)`.
- This formula calculates the diagonal distance from the fountain to the diagonal line `(r, c) = (n, 1)`, and divides it by 2 to approximate the area Alice can add to her plot.
- However, this approach does not account for the specific constraints and configurations of the field and fountains. It does not ensure that Alice's path can actually pass through the fountain without violating the rules of the game.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input and processes each test case.
- It calculates the initial size of Alice's plot (`alpha`) as `(n * m + 1) // 2`.
- For each fountain, it calls `func_1` to compute the additional area Alice can gain if she receives that fountain.
- Finally, it prints the initial size of Alice's plot and the computed additional areas for each fountain.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Additional Area**: The `func_1` function uses a heuristic that might not always provide the correct additional area Alice can gain. It does not consider the actual path Alice can take, which must be either down or right, starting from the left or top boundary and ending on the right or bottom boundary.
2. **Path Constraints Not Considered**: The function does not ensure that the fountain's position allows Alice to include it in her path while still maximizing the area of her plot.
3. **No Path Validation**: The program does not validate if the calculated additional area is achievable given the constraints of the field and the positions of the fountains.

Given these issues, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate. The function `func_1` and the overall logic of the program do not correctly handle the complex constraints and configurations required by the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not correct because it fails to accurately calculate the maximum size of Alice's plot and the additional area gained from each fountain, due to the heuristic nature of the `func_1` function and the lack of proper path validation.
