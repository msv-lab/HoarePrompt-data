### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the provided program and the original assessment to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Revisited:
- The goal is to find the maximum area Alice can own under the given constraints and adjust this area if Bob gives her one of his fountains.
- Alice starts from either the left or top side and moves down or right.
- Alice owns the part including cell \((n, 1)\).
- Bob owns the part including cell \((1, m)\).
- Each fountain cannot be on Alice's plot unless Bob gives it to her.

#### Code Revisited:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Correctly calculates the additional area Alice can gain if she can reach a fountain located at \((r, c)\).
   - The formula \( |r + c - (n + 1)| \) is used to calculate the "diagonal distance".
   - The additional area is calculated as \( \text{max}(|r + c - (n + 1)| // 2, 0) \), ensuring no negative values.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Correctly reads input from stdin and processes each test case.
   - Computes the initial maximum area Alice can own without any fountain (\(\alpha\)) as \(\frac{n \times m + 1}{2}\).
   - For each fountain, calculates the additional area Alice can gain if given that fountain using `func_1`.
   - Collects these additional areas and outputs the results.

#### Verification:
- The logic for calculating \(\alpha\) is correct: \(\frac{n \times m + 1}{2}\) ensures that Alice maximizes her area by starting from the left/top and ending at the designated cells.
- The calculation for the additional area for each fountain is correct: it considers the "diagonal distance" and ensures Alice gains the maximum possible area for each fountain.

However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Input Validation**: The original assessment mentions that the function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-positive integers for \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(r\), and \(c\)). The current implementation assumes valid inputs, but this is not explicitly handled in the code.

2. **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that all test cases and their inputs are valid, but the problem statement guarantees that the sum of \(k\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\). Still, handling invalid inputs would be a good practice.

Given that the core logic and calculations match the problem requirements and the provided function summaries, the program should be correct with the understanding that it assumes valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
- Since the core logic and calculations are correct and the program handles the problem as described, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
