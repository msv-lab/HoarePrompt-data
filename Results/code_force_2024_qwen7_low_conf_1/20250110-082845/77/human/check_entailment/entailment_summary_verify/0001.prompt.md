You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is a hard version of the problem; it differs from the easy version only
by the question. The easy version only needs you to print whether some values
are non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.

Alice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size n
\times m (2 \le n, m \le 10^9 ); the rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to
bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell
at the intersection of row r and column c is denoted as (r, c ).

Bob has k (2 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) fountains, all of them are located in
different cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but
she must meet several conditions:

  * To divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field. 
  * Alice's path will divide the field into two parts — one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part — to Bob. 
  * Alice will own the part that includes the cell (n, 1 ). 
  * Bob will own the part that includes the cell (1, m ). 

Alice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as
possible.

Bob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them
to Alice. First, output the integer \alpha — the maximum possible size of
Alice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will
remain on Bob's plot).

Then output k non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , where a_i is a
value such that after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum size of
her plot will be \alpha + a_i .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n, m \le 10^9 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the field sizes and the number of
fountains, respectively.

Then follow k lines, each containing two numbers r_i and c_i (1 \le r_i \le n
, 1 \le c_i \le m ) — the coordinates of the cell with the i -th fountain. It
is guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is (n, 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, first output \alpha — the maximum size of the plot that
can belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output
k non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , where a_i is a value such that
after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum size of her plot will be
\alpha + a_i .

The indices of the fountains are labeled in green. The cells belonging to
Alice are marked in blue.

Note that if Bob gives Alice fountain 1 or fountain 3 , then that fountain
cannot be on Alice's plot.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(fountain, n, m):
    (r, c) = fountain
    diagonal_distance = abs(r + c - (n + 1))
    return max(diagonal_distance // 2, 0)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        k = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        alpha = (n * m + 1) // 2
        additional_areas = []
        for __ in range(k):
            r = int(data[index])
            c = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            additional_areas.append(func_1((r, c), n, m))
        results.append((alpha, additional_areas))
    for result in results:
        (alpha, additional_areas) = result
        print(alpha)
        print(' '.join(map(str, additional_areas)))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of dimensions \(n \times m\). For each test case, it calculates an initial value \(\alpha\) which is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\). It also computes the area added by \(k\) fountains located at specific positions \((r, c)\) within the grid. For each fountain, it calls another function `func_1` to determine the additional area contributed by that fountain. The results for each test case are stored in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains \(\alpha\) and a list of the additional areas contributed by the fountains. Finally, the function prints \(\alpha\) and the list of additional areas for each test case. The function handles edge cases such as the unique positions of the fountains and the constraints on \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). However, it does not account for the possibility of invalid input (e.g., non-positive integers for \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(r\), and \(c\)).+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the problem and analyze the code.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to find the maximum area Alice can own given the constraints and then adjust this area if Bob gives her one of his fountains.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - The field is an \( n \times m \) rectangle.
   - Alice starts from either the left or top side and moves down or right.
   - Alice owns the part including cell \((n, 1)\).
   - Bob owns the part including cell \((1, m)\).
3. **Fountains**: There are \( k \) fountains, each located at a specific cell \((r_i, c_i)\). Each fountain cannot be on Alice's plot unless Bob gives it to her.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the additional area Alice can gain if she can reach a fountain located at \((r, c)\).
   - The logic used here is:
     - Calculate the "diagonal distance" from the fountain to the cell \((n, 1)\) using \( |r + c - (n + 1)| \).
     - The additional area Alice can gain is half of this distance rounded up, ensuring no negative values.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from stdin and processes each test case.
   - For each test case:
     - Computes the initial maximum area Alice can own without any fountain (\(\alpha\)) as \(\frac{n \times m + 1}{2}\).
     - For each fountain, calculates the additional area Alice can gain if given that fountain using `func_1`.
     - Collects these additional areas and outputs the results.

### Verification:
- The approach for calculating \(\alpha\) is correct because it ensures Alice maximizes her area by starting from the left/top and ending at the designated cells.
- The calculation for the additional area for each fountain is also correct, as it correctly considers the "diagonal distance" and rounds up to ensure Alice gains the maximum possible area for each fountain.

Given that the logic and calculations in the code match the problem requirements, the program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
