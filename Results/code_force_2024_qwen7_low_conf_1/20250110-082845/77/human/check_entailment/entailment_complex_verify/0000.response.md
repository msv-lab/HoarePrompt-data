### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
1. **Field Division**: Alice starts from the left or top side and moves either down or right until she reaches the right or bottom side of the field.
2. **Fountain Ownership**: Bob owns all fountains, but he can give one fountain to Alice.
3. **Objective**: Maximize the size of Alice's plot, which includes her path and the cells it covers.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the additional area Alice can gain by including a fountain at position `(r, c)` in her path.
   - The formula used is `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)`.
   - This formula aims to calculate the maximum distance Alice can move towards the bottom-right corner while avoiding the fountain.
   - However, this formula does not correctly capture the actual movement and configuration constraints of the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calculates the initial size of Alice's plot as \((n * m + 1) // 2\).
   - It then calculates the additional area Alice can gain for each fountain by calling `func_1`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Additional Area**:
   - The formula `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)` does not correctly account for the possible configurations of the fountains and the paths Alice can take.
   - Consider the example given in the problem description:
     - For a 2x2 grid with fountains at (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2):
       - Without any fountains, the maximum size of Alice's plot is 1.
       - If Bob gives Alice the fountain at (1,1), the correct additional area Alice can gain is indeed 1.
   - However, the function `func_1` incorrectly calculates this additional area.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the fountain is very close to the boundary or when multiple fountains are close to each other.
   - It assumes a linear path calculation which does not accurately reflect the problem's constraints.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The formula used in `func_1` does not accurately reflect the possible configurations and movements within the grid.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
