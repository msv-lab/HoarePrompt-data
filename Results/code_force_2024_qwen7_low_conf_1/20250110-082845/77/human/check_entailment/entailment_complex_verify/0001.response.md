### Reasoning:

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to find the maximum area Alice can own in an \( n \times m \) grid, and then adjust this area if Bob gives her one of his fountains.
- Alice starts from either the left or top side and moves down or right.
- Alice owns the part including cell \((n, 1)\), and Bob owns the part including cell \((1, m)\).
- Fountains are placed at specific cells, and each fountain cannot be on Alice's plot unless given to her by Bob.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Correctly calculates the additional area Alice can gain if she can reach a fountain located at \((r, c)\).
   - Uses the formula \( \text{diagonal distance} = |r + c - (n + 1)| \).
   - Ensures the additional area is non-negative by taking the maximum of half the diagonal distance and zero.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from stdin and processes each test case.
   - For each test case:
     - Correctly computes the initial maximum area Alice can own without any fountain (\(\alpha\)) as \(\frac{n \times m + 1}{2}\).
     - For each fountain, correctly calculates the additional area Alice can gain if given that fountain using `func_1`.
     - Collects these additional areas and outputs the results.

#### Verification:
- The approach for calculating \(\alpha\) is correct because it ensures Alice maximizes her area by starting from the left/top and ending at the designated cells.
- The calculation for the additional area for each fountain is also correct, as it correctly considers the "diagonal distance" and rounds up to ensure Alice gains the maximum possible area for each fountain.
