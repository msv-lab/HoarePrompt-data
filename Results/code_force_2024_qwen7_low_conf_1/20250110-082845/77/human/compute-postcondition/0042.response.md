According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, the state was as follows:
- `k` must be greater than 0 (initial condition)
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `index` is `index + 2`
- `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be decremented by 1, so `k` must now be greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 2`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
