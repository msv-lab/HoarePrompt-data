The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `c`. Given that `index` is 7, `data[index + 1]` corresponds to `data[8]`. The value of `c` is now the integer representation of `data[8]`. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 7, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\), `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`**
