The code initializes an empty list `additional_areas`. No changes are made to the existing variables, so their values remain the same. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `alpha` is `(n * m + 1) // 2`, `additional_areas` is an empty list**
