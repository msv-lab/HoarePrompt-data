The code updates the value of `c` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. From the initial state, we know that `c` was previously the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Now, since the line `c = int(data[index + 1])` is executed, `c` remains the same because the value of `data[index + 1]` is being reassigned to itself.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`k` is `m - 2`, `r` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is either `m + 1` or `m + 4`, `additional_areas` contains two elements where the second element is `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, and `r` is now the integer value from `data[index]`**
