The code prints the elements of `additional_areas` joined with spaces. However, the code itself does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that the elements of `additional_areas` are printed, but their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is \(2 + t \times 2 + 3\), `results` is a list of tuples, `alpha` is assigned from `result`, `additional_areas` is assigned from `result`, the elements of `additional_areas` are printed.**
