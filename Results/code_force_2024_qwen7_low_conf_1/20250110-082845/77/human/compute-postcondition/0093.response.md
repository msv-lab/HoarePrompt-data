Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of dimensions \(n \times m\). For each test case, it calculates an initial value \(\alpha\) which is \((n \times m + 1) // 2\). It also computes the area added by \(k\) fountains located at specific positions \((r, c)\) within the grid. For each fountain, it calls another function `func_1` to determine the additional area contributed by that fountain. The results for each test case are stored in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains \(\alpha\) and a list of the additional areas contributed by the fountains. Finally, the function prints \(\alpha\) and the list of additional areas for each test case. The function handles edge cases such as the unique positions of the fountains and the constraints on \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). However, it does not account for the possibility of invalid input (e.g., non-positive integers for \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), \(r\), and \(c\)).**
