`additional_areas` is an empty list before the code execution. The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to `additional_areas`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended. However, we know that `additional_areas` will contain this result after the append operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `alpha` is `(n * m + 1) // 2`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `r` is the value of `data[4]`, `c` is the value of `data[5]`**
