`index` is incremented by 2. Given the initial state, `index` was either `k` (which is `m - 1`) or `m + 2`. After incrementing `index` by 2, if `index` was initially `k`, it becomes `m - 1 + 2 = m + 1`. If `index` was initially `m + 2`, it becomes `m + 2 + 2 = m + 4`. The values of the other variables (`k`, `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is `m` - 1, `r` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is either `m` + 1 or `m` + 4, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
