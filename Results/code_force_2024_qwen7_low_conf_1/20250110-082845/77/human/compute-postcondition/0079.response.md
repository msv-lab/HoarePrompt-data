Let's break down the given information and the conditions required for the loop to execute:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `index` is calculated as \(2 + t \times 2 + 3\).
   - `results` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains:
     - `alpha`, which is \(\frac{n \times m + 1}{2}\) where `n` and `m` are the integers corresponding to the first two elements of the `data` list for each tuple.
     - `additional_areas`, which is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each fountain position \((r, c)\) provided in the `data` list for each tuple.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop `for result in results:` will iterate over each tuple in the `results` list.
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one tuple.

3. **Required Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `results` contains at least one tuple. This means the initial state should reflect that there is at least one tuple in the `results` list.
   - Additionally, since the `results` list is defined based on the values of `alpha` and `additional_areas` which depend on the `data` list, we need to ensure that `data` is defined and contains the necessary information to generate these values.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `results` is non-empty.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `index` is \(2 + t \times 2 + 3\).
- `results` is a list of tuples, with at least one tuple containing valid values for `alpha` and `additional_areas`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is \(2 + t \times 2 + 3\), `results` is a list of tuples, with at least one tuple containing valid values for `alpha` and `additional_areas`.**
