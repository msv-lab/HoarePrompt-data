`index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was `index + 4 + 4`, so the new value of `index` is `(index + 4 + 4) + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `(index + 4 + 4) + 2`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its current contents**
