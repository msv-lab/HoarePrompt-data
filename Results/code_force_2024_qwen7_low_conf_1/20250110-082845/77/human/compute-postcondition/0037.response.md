Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`.
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2]`.
- `m` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2 + 1]`.
- `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\).
- `additional_areas` is an empty list.

### For Loop:
```
for __ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs for `k` iterations. Therefore, the loop will execute if `k` is a positive integer greater than 0.
2. **Variables and Their Initial Values**:
   - `index`: The initial value of `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`. This is just an initial value and doesn't directly affect the loop's execution.
   - `results`: The list `results` contains one element, a tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`. Since the loop body is omitted, the content of `results` does not change during the loop.
   - `n`: This is derived from `data[2 + k * 2]`. The value of `n` is set based on this data.
   - `m`: This is derived from `data[2 + k * 2 + 1]`. The value of `m` is set based on this data.
   - `alpha`: This is calculated as \((n * m + 1) // 2\). The value of `alpha` is set based on the values of `n` and `m`.
   - `additional_areas`: This is an empty list and does not change within the loop.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop requires `k` to be a positive integer greater than 0. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`k` must be greater than 0**.

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once if `k` is a positive integer.
