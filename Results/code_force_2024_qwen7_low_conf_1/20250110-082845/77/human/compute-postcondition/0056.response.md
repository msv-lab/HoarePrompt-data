The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `m`. The value of `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1, `k` can be 1 (the smallest possible value since it's incremented by 1). 

Let's assume the smallest possible value for `k` to simplify the calculation:

- `k = 1`
- `index = 2 + 1 * 2 + 3 = 7`

Given that `r` is the integer value of `data[7]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`, and `m` is the integer value of `data[9]` (since `index + 1` would be `8 + 1 = 9`), the value of `m` is `data[9]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `k` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1
- `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`
- `index` is `7`
- `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from `0` to `k-1`
- `results` is a list that now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[7]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[9]`

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `index` is 7, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from 0 to k-1, `results` is a list that now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[9]`**
