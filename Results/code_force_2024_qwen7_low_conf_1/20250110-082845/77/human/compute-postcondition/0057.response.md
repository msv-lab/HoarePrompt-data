`k` is initially a non-negative integer incremented by 1. The code updates `k` to be the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, where `index` is 7. Since `data[index + 2]` means `data[9]`, and `m` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `k` is now set to `m`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is `m`, `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `index` is 7, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from 0 to k-1, `results` is a list that now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[9]`**
