According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `k` must be greater than 1.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` (updated).
- `index` is `index + 4`.
- `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its current contents.

For the loop to execute again, `k` must be decremented by 1 but still remain greater than 1. Additionally, the values of `r`, `c`, and `index` need to be updated as per the loop's progression. The function call `func_1` will be made again with the updated values of `r` and `c`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `k` must be greater than 0 (since it was decremented by 1 from the previous value that was > 1).
- `r` will be the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `c` will be the integer value of `data[index + 1]` (updated).
- `index` will be `index + 4`.
- `additional_areas` will contain the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its current contents.

State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` (updated), `index` is `index + 4`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its current contents**
