The code prints the elements of `additional_areas` using `map(str, additional_areas)` and `join` with a space delimiter. However, this operation does not change the value of any variable. It only outputs the content of `additional_areas`.

The initial state is:
- `t` is a positive integer
- `index` is \(2 + (t + 1) \times 2 + 3\)
- `alpha` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`
- `additional_areas` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`

After running the code, the values of `t`, `index`, `alpha`, and `additional_areas` remain unchanged. The only effect is that `additional_areas` is printed.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `index` is \(2 + (t + 1) \times 2 + 3\); `alpha` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`; `additional_areas` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`; `additional_areas` is printed.**
