The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The initial value of `index` is 0, so after the increment, `index` will be 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `data`, `r`, `c`, and `index`) are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is int(data[0]), `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 * 10^5, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input, `r` and `c` are positive integers representing the row and column of a fountain, with 1 ≤ `r` ≤ `n` and 1 ≤ `c` ≤ `m`, and all fountain positions are unique and none of them is (`n`, 1), `index` is 1.**
