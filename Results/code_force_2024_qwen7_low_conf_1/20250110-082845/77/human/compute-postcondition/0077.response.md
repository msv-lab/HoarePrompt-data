The code appends a tuple containing `alpha` and `additional_areas` to the `results` list. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `alpha`. Since no value is given for `alpha`, it remains undefined. The other variables (`k`, `r`, `c`, `index`, and `additional_areas`) are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is 0, `r` is the integer value from `data[2*m + 8]`, `c` is the integer value from `data[2*m + 10]`, `index` is `2*m + 10`, `additional_areas` is a list of length `m` where each element is `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `results` is a list with one tuple containing `alpha` and `additional_areas`**
