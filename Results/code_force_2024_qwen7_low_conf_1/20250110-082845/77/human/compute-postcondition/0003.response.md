`t` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input, and `index` is 0. This means `t` is converted from the first element in the list `data`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `data`, and `index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is int(data[0]), `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 * 10^5, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input, for each test case, `r` and `c` are positive integers representing the row and column of a fountain, with 1 ≤ `r` ≤ `n` and 1 ≤ `c` ≤ `m`, and all fountain positions are unique and none of them is (`n`, 1), `index` is 0.**
