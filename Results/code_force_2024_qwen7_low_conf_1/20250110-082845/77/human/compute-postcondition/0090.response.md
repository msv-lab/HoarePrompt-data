The code `print(' '.join(map(str, additional_areas)))` prints the elements of the `additional_areas` list, separated by spaces, but it does not modify the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is in the output, which is the printed content.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `index` is calculated as \(2 + (t + 1) \times 2 + 5\).
- `alpha` is the first element of `result`.
- `additional_areas` is the second element of `result`.
- The value of `alpha` is printed.

The code does not affect the values of `t`, `index`, `alpha`, or `additional_areas`. The output is simply the contents of `additional_areas` converted to strings and joined with spaces.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is \(2 + (t + 1) \times 2 + 5\), `alpha` is the first element of `result`, `additional_areas` is the second element of `result`, and the value of `alpha` is printed.**
