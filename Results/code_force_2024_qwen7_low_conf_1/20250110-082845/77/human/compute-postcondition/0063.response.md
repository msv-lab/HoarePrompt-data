The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `c`. The initial conditions state that `k` (which is `m`) must be greater than 0 and `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`. Since the code does not affect `k` or `r`, these variables remain unchanged. The only new variable affected is `c`, which is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`k` (which is `m`) is greater than 0; `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
