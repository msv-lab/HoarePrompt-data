The code prints the value of `alpha`. The value of `alpha` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`. The value of `index` and the value of `t` remain unchanged, and the values of `additional_areas` are printed but not updated. Therefore, the output state includes the printed value of `alpha`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `index` is \(2 + (t + 1) \times 2 + 3\); `alpha` is the first element of the second tuple in `results`; `additional_areas` is the second element of the second tuple in `results`; `alpha` is printed.**
