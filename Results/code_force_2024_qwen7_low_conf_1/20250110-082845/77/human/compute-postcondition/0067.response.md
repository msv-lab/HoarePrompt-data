The code `r = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `r`. Given the initial state:

- `k` (which is `m`) is greater than 0
- `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `index` is `k` or `m` plus 2
- `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`
- `k` must be decreased by 1

The only changes made by the code are to the variable `r`, which now holds the integer value from `data[index]`, and `k`, which is decreased by 1. 

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `r` is the integer value from `data[index]`
- `k` is now `k - 1`

The output state is:
Output State: **`k` is `m` - 1, `r` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `k` or `m` + 2, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
