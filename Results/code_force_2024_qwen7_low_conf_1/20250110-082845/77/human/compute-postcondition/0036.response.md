The code initializes an empty list `additional_areas`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so we only need to note that `additional_areas` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2 + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\), `additional_areas` is an empty list**.
