`r` is reassigned the value of `int(data[index])`. Since `index` was previously updated to `index + 4`, the new value of `index` is used here. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `index + 4 + 4`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its current contents**
