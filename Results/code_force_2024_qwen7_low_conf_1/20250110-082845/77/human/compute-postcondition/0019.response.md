The code `r = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` (which is `data[7]` since `index` is 7) to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 7, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\), `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is the value of `data[5]`**
