Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is defined as follows:
   - `k` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1.
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index]` where `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`.
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` where `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`.
   - `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`.
   - `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from `0` to `k-1`.
   - `results` is a list that now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   n = int(data[index])
   ```

3. This line of code assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. Since `index` is already defined as `2 + k * 2 + 3`, this does not change the value of `index` but changes `n` to the integer value of `data[index]`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `k` remains a non-negative integer incremented by 1.
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[index]` where `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`.
- `c` remains the integer value of `data[index + 1]` where `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`.
- `index` remains `2 + k * 2 + 3`.
- `additional_areas` remains unchanged.
- `results` remains a list that includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.
- `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]` where `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` where `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`, `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from `0` to `k-1`, `results` is a list that now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**.
