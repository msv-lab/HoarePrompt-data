The code appends a tuple containing `alpha` and `additional_areas` to the `results` list. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `alpha`, `additional_areas`, or the contents of `results`, we only know that `results` now includes this new tuple. The variables `k`, `r`, `c`, `index`, and `additional_areas` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]` where `index` is `2 + (k-1) * 2 + 3`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` where `index` is `2 + (k-1) * 2 + 3`; `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`; `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration of the loop from `0` to `k-1`; `results` is a list that now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`**.
