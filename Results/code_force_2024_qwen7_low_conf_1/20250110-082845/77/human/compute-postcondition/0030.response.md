Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `index` is `2 + k * 2`.
   - `results` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
   - `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
   - `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`.
   - `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\).
   - `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop will iterate `t` times.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it will decrement `t` by 1 each time the loop runs.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop decrements `t` by 1 each time, the new value of `t` after one iteration will be `t - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` has been decremented by 1 and is still greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `index` is `2 + k * 2`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\); `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`.**
