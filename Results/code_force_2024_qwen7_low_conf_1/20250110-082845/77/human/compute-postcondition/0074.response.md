`index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was either `m + 1` or `m + 4`. After incrementing by 2, the new value of `index` would be either `m + 3` or `m + 6`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`k` is `m - 2`, `r` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is either `m + 3` or `m + 6`, `additional_areas` contains two elements where the second element is `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, and `r` is now the integer value from `data[index]`**
