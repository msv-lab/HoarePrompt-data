The value of `index` is incremented by 2, which means `index` now points to two positions ahead in the list. The values of `k`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2**
