The code assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to `c`. The previous value of `c` was the integer value of `data[index + 1]` when `index` was `k` or `m + 2`. After executing the code, the new value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is `m` - 1, `r` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `k` or `m` + 2, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
