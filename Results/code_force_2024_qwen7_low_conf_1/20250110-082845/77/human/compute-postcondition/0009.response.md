`k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `k` becomes `int(data[1 + 2])`, which simplifies to `int(data[3])`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`**
