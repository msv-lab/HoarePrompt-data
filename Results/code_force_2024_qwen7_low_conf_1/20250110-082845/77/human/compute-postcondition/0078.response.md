Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is `2 + t * 2 + 3`, `results` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains `alpha` and `additional_areas`; `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\) for each tuple, where `n` and `m` are the integers corresponding to the first two elements of the `data` list for each tuple; `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each fountain position \((r, c)\) provided in the `data` list for each tuple; `r` and `c` are the integers corresponding to the fountain positions in the `data` list for each tuple.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, updating `n`, `m`, `k`, `index`, `alpha`, and `additional_areas` for each iteration.
- After all iterations, `t` must be a positive integer.
- `index` will be calculated as `2 + t * 2 + 3` because for each iteration, `index` is incremented by `2 + 3`.
- `results` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `alpha` and `additional_areas`.
- For each tuple in `results`, `alpha` is calculated as \((n * m + 1) // 2\) using the values of `n` and `m` corresponding to the iteration.
- `additional_areas` is a list of the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each fountain position \((r, c)\) provided in the `data` list during the iteration.
- The loop ensures that all fountain positions are unique and none of them is \((n, 1)\).
