The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `data`, `r`, `c`, or `index`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is int(data[0]), `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 * 10^5, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input, `r` and `c` are positive integers representing the row and column of a fountain, with 1 ≤ `r` ≤ `n` and 1 ≤ `c` ≤ `m`, and all fountain positions are unique and none of them is (`n`, 1), `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list**.
