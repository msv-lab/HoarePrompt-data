The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Based on the initial state, `k` must be greater than 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` (updated), `index` is `index + 2`, and `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`. After executing the code, the value of `index` is updated to its current value plus 2.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` (updated); `index` is `index + 4`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
