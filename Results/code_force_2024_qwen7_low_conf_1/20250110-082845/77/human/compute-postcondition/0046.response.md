The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The values of `r`, `c`, `index`, and `k` remain unchanged. After executing the code, the updated state is as follows:

- `k` must be greater than 1
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` (updated)
- `index` is `index + 4`
- `additional_areas` now contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its current contents

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` (updated); `index` is `index + 4`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its current contents**
