The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `c` by converting the value at `data[index + 1]` to an integer. The initial state is that `k` must be greater than 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `index + 2`, and `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`. After the code executes, `c` will be updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` (updated); `index` is `index + 2`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
