Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables and their roles**:
   - `k`: A non-negative integer.
   - `r` and `c`: Integer values derived from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` respectively, where `index` is calculated as `2 + (k-1) * 2 + 3`.
   - `index`: The current index used to access `data` in the loop.
   - `additional_areas`: A list containing results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from `0` to `k-1`.
   - `results`: A list that now includes tuples `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, and we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Determine changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` is used as the loop variable (a common practice when the loop index is not needed), we focus on the changes in the state after each iteration.
   - After each iteration, `k` will increment by 1 because it's used to calculate `index`.
   - `index` will be updated to `2 + k * 2 + 3` for the next iteration.
   - `r` and `c` will be recalculated based on the new `index`.
   - `additional_areas` will be updated with the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for the current `k`.

Given the initial state and the loop condition, let's update the state for the next iteration:

- At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` and `c` are the values derived from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` where `index` is `2 + (k-1) * 2 + 3`.
- `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`.
- `additional_areas` contains results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from `0` to `k-1`.
- `results` is a list that includes tuples `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

For the next iteration:
- `k` will be incremented by 1.
- `index` will become `2 + k * 2 + 3`.
- `r` and `c` will be recalculated using the new `index`.
- `additional_areas` will be updated with the new result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`k` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]` where `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` where `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`, `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from `0` to `k-1`, `results` is a list that now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`**.
