Output State: **`k` must be a non-negative integer; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]` where `index` is `2 + (k-1) * 2 + 3`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` where `index` is `2 + (k-1) * 2 + 3`; `index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`; `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration of the loop from `0` to `k-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `k` iterations.
- Each iteration increments `index` by 2 and appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to `additional_areas`.
- After `k` iterations, `index` will be `2 + k * 2 + 3`.
- `r` and `c` are the values read from `data` at positions `index` and `index + 1` respectively for each iteration.
- `additional_areas` will contain the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `k` is 0):
- `k` must be 0.
- `index` remains `2 + k * 2 + 3`, which is `5`.
- `r` and `c` do not get updated since the loop does not run.
- `additional_areas` remains an empty list.
