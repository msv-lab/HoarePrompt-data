The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, the variable `index` is `2 + k * 2`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `index` is `2 + k * 2`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2]; `m` is the integer value of `data[2]; `k` is the integer value of `data[3]; `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\); `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`.**
