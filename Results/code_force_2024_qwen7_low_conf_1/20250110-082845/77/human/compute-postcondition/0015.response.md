`c` is assigned the value of `data[index + 1]`, which is `data[5]` since `index` is 4. The value of `data[5]` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains as `data[5]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `alpha` is `(n * m + 1) // 2`, `additional_areas` is an empty list, `r` is the value of `data[4]`, `c` is the value of `data[5]`**
