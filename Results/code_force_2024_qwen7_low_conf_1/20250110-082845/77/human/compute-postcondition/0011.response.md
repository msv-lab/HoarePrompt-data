`alpha` is assigned the value `(n * m + 1) // 2`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are derived from `data[1]`, `data[2]`, and `data[3]` respectively. However, the specific values of `data[1]`, `data[2]`, and `data[3]` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express `alpha` in terms of `n` and `m`.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `index`, `results`, `n`, `m`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `alpha` is `(n * m + 1) // 2`**
