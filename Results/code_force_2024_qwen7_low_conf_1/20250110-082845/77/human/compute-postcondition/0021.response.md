The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was 7, so now it is 9. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 9, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\), `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`**
