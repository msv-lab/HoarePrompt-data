The code updates the value of `r` to be the integer value of `data[index]`. Given the initial state, the previous value of `r` was the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. After executing the code, `r` will now be the integer value of `data[index]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 2`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
