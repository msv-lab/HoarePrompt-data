The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. Here, `r` and `c` are integers from the `data` list at specified indices, and `n` and `m` are presumably predefined values.

- `k` must be greater than 0: This condition is not directly affected by the code.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`: After the execution, `r` remains unchanged because the code does not alter its value.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`: Similarly, `c` remains unchanged.
- `index` is increased by 2: The value of `index` is incremented by 2.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `index + 2`; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.**
