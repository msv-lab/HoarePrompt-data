The value of `index` is incremented by 2, so the previous value of `index` (which was `k` or `m`) plus 2. The states of the other variables (`r` and `c`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` (which is `m`) is greater than 0; `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `k` or `m` plus 2.

Output State: **`k` (which is `m`) is greater than 0; `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `k` or `m` plus 2**
