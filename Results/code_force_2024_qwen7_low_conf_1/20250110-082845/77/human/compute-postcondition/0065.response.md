`additional_areas.append(func_1((r, c), n, m))` appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The values of `k` (which is `m`), `r`, `c`, and `index` remain unchanged. The function call `func_1((r, c), n, m)` is executed but its result is not specified, so we represent it as the appended value in the list.

Output State: **`k` (which is `m`) is greater than 0; `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is `k` or `m` plus 2; `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
