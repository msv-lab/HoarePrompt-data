The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The values of `t`, `index`, `results`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `alpha`, `r`, `c`, and `additional_areas` before the execution are as follows:

- `t` must be greater than 0
- `index` is 9
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`
- `k` must be greater than 1
- `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)
- `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`
- `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`

After the code executes, the list `additional_areas` will have one more element appended to it, which is the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 9, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\), `additional_areas` is a list containing the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`**
