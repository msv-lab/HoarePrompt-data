The code `results.append((alpha, additional_areas))` appends a tuple containing `alpha` and `additional_areas` to the list `results`. 

Let's break down the initial state and see how this impacts the variables:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `index` is `2 + k * 2`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
- `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`.
- `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\).
- `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`.

After running the code, the value of `results` changes. Initially, `results` was an empty list, and now it contains one additional element, which is the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `index` is `2 + k * 2`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple (`alpha`, `additional_areas`); `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\); `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`.**
