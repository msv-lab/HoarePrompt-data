The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `c`. Given the initial state, `index` is 10, so `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[11]`. The value of `c` is the integer value of `data[11]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 10, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\), `additional_areas` is a list containing the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `r` is the integer value of `data[10]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[11]`**
