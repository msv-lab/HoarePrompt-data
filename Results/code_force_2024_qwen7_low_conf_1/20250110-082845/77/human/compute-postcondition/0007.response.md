The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. Given the initial state where `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list, the only variable that gets updated is `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`**
