The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the `additional_areas` list. The values of `k`, `r`, `c`, `index`, and `additional_areas` are updated as follows:

- `k` remains greater than 0.
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[index + 4]`.
- `c` remains the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `index` is updated to `(index + 4 + 4) + 2`, which simplifies to `index + 10`.
- `additional_areas` is updated to include the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `index + 10`, `additional_areas` contains the original contents plus the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
