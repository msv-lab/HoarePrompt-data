`alpha` is assigned the value \((n * m + 1) // 2\). Here, \(n\) is the integer value of `data[7]` and \(m\) is the integer value of `data[9]`. The value of `k` is `m`, which means \(k\) remains unchanged. The value of `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`, and the value of `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`. The value of `index` is 10, and `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from 0 to \(k-1\). The value of `results` is a list that now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is `m`, `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `index` is 10, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from 0 to `k-1`, `results` is a list that now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
