According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The loop will run `t` times. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. 

Let's break down the required adjustments:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `index` must be set to 1 as per the given initial state.
- `results` is initially an empty list and remains unchanged within the loop, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list**
