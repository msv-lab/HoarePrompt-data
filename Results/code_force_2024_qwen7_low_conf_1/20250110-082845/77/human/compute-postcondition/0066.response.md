According to the code, the loop iterates `k` times. The loop variable `__` is incremented with each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `k` (which is `m`) is greater than 0.
- `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
- `index` is `k` or `m` plus 2.
- `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `__` must be less than `k`. Since `__` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, after `k - 1` iterations, `__` will be equal to `k - 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `__` must be equal to `k - 1`, which means `k` must be decremented by 1.

Let's update the states accordingly:

- `k` (which is `m`) will be `k - 1`.
- `r` remains the same.
- `c` remains the same.
- `index` remains the same.
- `additional_areas` remains the same.

State: **`k` (which is `m`) is greater than 0, `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `k` or `m` plus 2, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, and `k` must be decreased by 1**.
