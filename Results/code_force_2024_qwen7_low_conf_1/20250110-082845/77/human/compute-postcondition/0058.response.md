The variable `index` is incremented by 3. Initially, `index` is 7, so after the increment, `index` becomes 10. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is `m`, `r` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `index` is 10, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration from 0 to k-1, `results` is a list that now includes the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[9]`**
