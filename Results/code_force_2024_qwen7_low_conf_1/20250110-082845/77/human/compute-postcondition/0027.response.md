The code `additional_areas.append(func_1((r, c), n, m))` appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The variables `t`, `index`, `results`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `alpha`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `additional_areas` now contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` in addition to its previous elements (if any).
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `index` is 12.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
- `k` must be greater than 1.
- `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\).
- `additional_areas` includes the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[10]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[11]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 12; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `k` must be greater than 1; `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\); `additional_areas` includes the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`; `r` is the integer value of `data[10]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[11]`**.
