The code `index += 3` increments the value of `index` by 3. The previous value of `index` was `2 + k * 2`. After the increment, the new value of `index` becomes `2 + k * 2 + 3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`index` is `2 + k * 2 + 3`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2]`; `m` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2 + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\); `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k` and `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
