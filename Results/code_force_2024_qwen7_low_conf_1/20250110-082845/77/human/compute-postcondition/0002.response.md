The code `index = 0` assigns the integer value 0 to the variable `index`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their states. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases; `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input; for each test case, `r` and `c` are positive integers representing the row and column of a fountain, with 1 ≤ `r` ≤ `n` and 1 ≤ `c` ≤ `m`, and all fountain positions are unique and none of them is (`n`, 1); `index` is 0.**
