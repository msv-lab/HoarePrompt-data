`index` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 10 to 12. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 12, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` must be greater than 1, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\), `additional_areas` is a list containing the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `r` is the integer value of `data[10]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[11]`**
