According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `m - 1`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to update `k` to `k - 1` because the loop decrements `k` by 1 in each iteration. Additionally, we need to ensure that `index` remains either `m + 1` or `m + 4` as it does not change within the loop. The variables `r`, `c`, and `additional_areas` also remain unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`k` is `m` - 2, `r` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is either `m` + 1 or `m` + 4, `additional_areas` contains two elements where the second element is `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
