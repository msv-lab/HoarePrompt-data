The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5. Additionally, for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `r` and `c` representing the row and column of a fountain, with 1 ≤ r ≤ n and 1 ≤ c ≤ m, and all fountain positions are unique and none of them is (n, 1).

The function does not return a value directly from the given information, but rather processes the test cases based on the provided parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, and `c`, and processes them according to the specified constraints.**
