Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is `2 + k * 2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\), `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `k` times, incrementing `index` by 2 after each iteration.
- Each iteration calls `func_1((r, c), n, m)` with `r` and `c` being the values from `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]`, respectively, where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`.
- After `k` iterations, `index` will be `2 + k * 2`.
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `results` remains an empty list as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n`, `m`, and `alpha` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` and `c` are the values from the `data` list corresponding to the current iteration.
