The value of `index` is incremented by 3. Initially, `index` is 1, so after the increment, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`**
