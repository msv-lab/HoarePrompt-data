`c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data[index + 1]` is an element in the `data` list at the index `index + 1`, and this value is converted to an integer. The values of `k` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
