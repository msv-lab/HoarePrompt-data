The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, but `data` is now assigned the split result. 

Since the initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, they are left as their original values in the precondition. The only new variable introduced is `data`, which is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases; `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input; for each test case, `r` and `c` are positive integers representing the row and column of a fountain, with 1 ≤ `r` ≤ `n` and 1 ≤ `c` ≤ `m`, and all fountain positions are unique and none of them is (`n`, 1)**.
