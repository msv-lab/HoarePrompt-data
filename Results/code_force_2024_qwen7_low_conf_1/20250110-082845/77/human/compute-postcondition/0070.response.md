The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The value of `additional_areas` was previously `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, and now it includes this value again.

Output State: **`k` is `m` - 1, `r` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is either `m` + 1 or `m` + 4, `additional_areas` contains two elements where the second element is `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
