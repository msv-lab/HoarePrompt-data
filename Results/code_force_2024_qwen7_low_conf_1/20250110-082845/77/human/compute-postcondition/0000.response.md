The provided code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not actually perform any operations that would change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, or `c`. It simply reassigns the `input` function to be `sys.stdin.read`, which is a method of reading the entire standard input as a single string. However, this does not execute the input reading process itself.

Therefore, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, and `c` remain in their initial states as defined in the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases; `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 * 10^5; for each test case, `r` and `c` are positive integers representing the row and column of a fountain, with 1 ≤ `r` ≤ `n` and 1 ≤ `c` ≤ `m`, and all fountain positions are unique and none of them is (`n`, 1); the function `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`.**
