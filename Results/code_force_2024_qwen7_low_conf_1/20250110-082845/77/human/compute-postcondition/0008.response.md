`m` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `data[index + 1]` is `data[2]`. The value of `data[2]` is unknown, but it will be converted to an integer and assigned to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`**
