The code `m = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `m` to be the integer value of `data` at the index `index + 1`. The previous value of `m` was `data[2]`, and now it is updated to `data[index + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `index` is `2 + k * 2`, the new value of `m` is `data[2 + k * 2 + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `index` is `2 + k * 2`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2]`; `m` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2 + 1]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\); `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`.**
