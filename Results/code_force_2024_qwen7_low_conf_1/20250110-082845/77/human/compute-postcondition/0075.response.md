The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to `additional_areas`. The previous value of `additional_areas` is `[func_1((r, c), n, m)]`, since it had two elements before and the second element was `func_1((r, c), n, m)`. The function call `func_1((r, c), n, m)` will be added as the third element in `additional_areas`.

The values of `k`, `r`, `c`, `index`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `k` is `m - 2`
- `r` is the integer value from `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`
- `index` is either `m + 3` or `m + 6`
- `additional_areas` contains three elements: the first element is unspecified, the second element is `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, and the third element is `func_1((r, c), n, m)`

Output State: **`k` is `m - 2`, `r` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is either `m + 3` or `m + 6`, `additional_areas` contains three elements where the first element is unspecified, the second element is `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, and the third element is `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
