The code updates the value of `c` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The previous value of `c` was the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, but now it is reassigned. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 4]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is `index + 4 + 4`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` appended to its current contents**
