The code snippet `k = int(data[index + 2])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 2]` to the variable `k`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `index` is `2 + k * 2`
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2]`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2 + 1]`
- `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`
- `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)
- `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k`.

After the code `k = int(data[index + 2])` is executed:
- The value of `k` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`index` is `2 + k * 2`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2]`; `m` is the integer value of `data[2 + k * 2 + 1]`; `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\); `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, where `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + 2 * (i-1)]` and `c` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * (i-1)]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `k` and `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
