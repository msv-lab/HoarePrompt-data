The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `fountain` containing the coordinates `(r, c)` of a fountain on a field, along with the dimensions `n` and `m` of the field. It calculates the maximum of half the absolute difference between the sum of the fountain's coordinates and the sum of the field dimensions incremented by one (`abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2`), and zero. The function returns this calculated value. The function handles edge cases where the result of the calculation could be negative by ensuring the returned value is at least zero.
