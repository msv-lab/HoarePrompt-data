Precondition: **t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases; n, m, and k are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5; for each test case, r and c are positive integers representing the row and column of a fountain, with 1 ≤ r ≤ n and 1 ≤ c ≤ m, and all fountain positions are unique and none of them is (n, 1).**
