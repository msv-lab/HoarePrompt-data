Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a non-negative integer input provided by the user, `n` is an integer input provided by the user, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 4`, and `i` is 4.***

Explanation: Given the precondition and the if part's postcondition, the overall postcondition for the if-else block is simply the postcondition of the if part since there is no else part to consider. The if condition checks if `x % i == 0` (which is true as `i` is 4). If this condition holds, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 4`. Therefore, after the execution of the if-else block, `ans` will be updated accordingly, and all other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `i`) will retain their values as per the initial precondition.
