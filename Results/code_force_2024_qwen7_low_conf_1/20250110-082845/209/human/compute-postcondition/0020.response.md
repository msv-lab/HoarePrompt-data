Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a non-negative integer input provided by the user, `n` is an integer input provided by the user, `ans` is unchanged, and `i` is 4. If `n \leq x // i`, then the program continues with the condition being true. Since there is no else part, the state remains as specified in the if part.***
