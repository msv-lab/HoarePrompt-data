Postcondition: ***`total` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the largest integer such that `x` is divisible by `n` and `n` is within the range of the loop, `x % n` equals 0, `ans` retains its original value unless `n > i`, in which case `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `i` (where `i` is `x // n`); `i` is `x // n`.***
