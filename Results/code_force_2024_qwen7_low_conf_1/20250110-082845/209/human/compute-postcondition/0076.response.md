Output State: **`total` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is the maximum of all possible values where `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and either `x // i` (if `n <= i`) or `x // (x // i)` (if `n > i`), and `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` if the loop executes at least once. If the loop does not execute, `ans` remains 1.**
