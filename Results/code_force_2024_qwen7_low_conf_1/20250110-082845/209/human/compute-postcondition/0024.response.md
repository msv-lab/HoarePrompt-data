Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a non-negative integer input provided by the user, `n` is an integer input provided by the user, `ans` is the maximum value between its original value and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, and `i` is the largest integer such that `x` is divisible by `i` and `i` is within the range of the loop.**

Explanation:
1. The loop iterates over all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `x`.
2. For each integer `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
3. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.
4. If `x` is also divisible by `x // i` (which is the corresponding pair divisor of `i`), it updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.

After the loop completes, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, and `i` will be the largest integer such that `x` is divisible by `i` and `i` is within the range of the loop.
