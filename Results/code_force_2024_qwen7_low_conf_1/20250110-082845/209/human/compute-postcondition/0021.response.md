`ans` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `x // i`. The value of `i` is 4, so `x // i` is the integer division of `x` by 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a non-negative integer input provided by the user, `n` is an integer input provided by the user, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 4`, and `i` is 4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a non-negative integer input provided by the user, `n` is an integer input provided by the user, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 4`, and `i` is 4.**
