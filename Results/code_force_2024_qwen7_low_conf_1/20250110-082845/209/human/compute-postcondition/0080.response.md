Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`. It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` to find the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` that satisfies certain conditions related to `n`. Finally, it prints the maximum value found. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `x` is a perfect square and `n` is equal to the square root of `x`, both `i` and `x // i` will be the same, and the function will correctly identify this as the maximum value.
- If `n` is exactly equal to `x`, the function will correctly identify `x` as the maximum value.
- If `n` is greater than the square root of `x`, the function will only consider `x // i` for values of `i` up to the square root of `x`, ensuring that the maximum value is correctly identified.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided annotations and return postconditions do not align with the actual code. The code iterates over a range determined by the input `t`, but the annotations suggest that `t` is read inside the function. The annotations also mention that the function accepts `t`, `x`, and `n` as parameters, whereas the code only takes `x` and `n` as inputs and reads `t` internally. Therefore, the function does not explicitly accept `t` as a parameter and instead processes multiple test cases in a loop.
