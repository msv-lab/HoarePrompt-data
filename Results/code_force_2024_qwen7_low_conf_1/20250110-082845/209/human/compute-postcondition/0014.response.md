Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a non-negative integer input provided by the user, `n` is an integer input provided by the user, `ans` is updated to `max(ans, x // 2)` if `x % 2 == 0` and `n <= x // 2`, and `i` is 3. If `n <= x // 3`, then `ans` is updated to `max(ans, x // 2)` under the specified conditions; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
