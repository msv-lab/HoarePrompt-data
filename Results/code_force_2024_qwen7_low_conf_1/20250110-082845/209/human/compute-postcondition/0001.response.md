`x` and `n` are assigned the values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the user needs to input two integers separated by a space, which will be assigned to `x` and `n` respectively. The values of `t` and the initial values of `x` and `n` are replaced by the new inputs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is the integer input provided by the user, `n` is the integer input provided by the user**
