The code snippet `ans = max(ans, x // i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. The value of `i` is `i_end + 1`, so the division `x // i` is performed, and `ans` is updated based on this value. The other variables (`total`, `t`, `x`, `i_end`, `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` has been updated to the maximum of its current value and `x // i`, while the other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is at least 1, `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // (i_end + 1)`, `i` is `i_end + 1`**
