The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum between its current value and `i`, which is 4. Since `ans` is unchanged in the initial state, it remains as it was. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `i`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a non-negative integer input provided by the user, `n` is an integer input provided by the user, `ans` is unchanged, and `i` is 4**
