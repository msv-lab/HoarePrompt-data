State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is the integer input provided by the user, `n` is the integer input provided by the user, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` must be a non-negative number, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 1**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Initialization (`i`)**: The loop starts with `i = 1`, so `i` should be initialized to 1.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 1, which means `x` must be a non-negative number (since the square root of a negative number is not defined in real numbers).
3. **Other Variables**: The initial values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` do not affect the loop's execution directly, but they are part of the overall program state.

Thus, the state to adjust for the loop to execute is that `i` is 1, `x` must be a non-negative number, and `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 1.
