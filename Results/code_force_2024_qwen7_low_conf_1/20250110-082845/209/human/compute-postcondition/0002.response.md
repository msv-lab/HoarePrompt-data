The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains as the initial state with the addition that `ans` is now 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is the integer input provided by the user, `n` is the integer input provided by the user, `ans` is 1**
