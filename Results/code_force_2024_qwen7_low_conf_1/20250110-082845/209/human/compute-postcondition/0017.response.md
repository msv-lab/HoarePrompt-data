Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a non-negative integer input provided by the user, `n` is an integer input provided by the user, `ans` is updated to `max(ans, x // 3)` if `n <= x // 3`, and `i` is 3. If `x % 3 == 0` and `n <= x // 3`, `ans` is updated to `max(ans, x // 3)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
