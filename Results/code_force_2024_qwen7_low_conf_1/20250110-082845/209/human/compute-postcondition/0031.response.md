Postcondition: ***`total` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the input integer, and `i` is the largest integer such that `x` is divisible by `i` and `i` is within the range of the loop for the new input. Additionally, `x % i` equals 0, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`***
