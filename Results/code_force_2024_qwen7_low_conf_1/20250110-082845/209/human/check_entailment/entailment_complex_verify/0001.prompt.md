You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if n <= x // i:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if n <= i:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if n <= x // i:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if n <= i:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum value obtained during the loop iterations among `i` and `x // i` based on the conditions provided, `i` is the largest integer such that `x` is divisible by `i` and `i` is within the range of the loop, and `ans` is printed after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`. It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` to find the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` that satisfies certain conditions related to `n`. Finally, it prints the maximum value found. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to understand the logic and verify if it matches the problem requirements. The goal is to find the maximum balance (GCD) of difficulties for `n` sub-problems whose sum equals `x`.

### Analysis:

1. **Input and Output Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case. It also correctly prints the result for each test case.

2. **Logic for Calculating Maximum Balance**:
   - For each test case, the program iterates over possible divisors `i` of `x` up to `sqrt(x)` and checks if dividing `x` by `i` gives a valid solution (i.e., the number of sub-problems does not exceed `n`).
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates the maximum balance with `i`.
   - Similarly, if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates the maximum balance with `x // i`.
   - This ensures that the maximum GCD (balance) is found by considering both the divisor and the quotient.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `x` is prime or has few divisors efficiently by iterating up to `sqrt(x)` and checking the divisors.
   - The approach ensures that the maximum GCD is found even if `x` is a prime number (in which case the GCD would be 1).

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the program is approximately O(sqrt(x)) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8).

Given the above analysis, the program logic correctly implements the required functionality and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
