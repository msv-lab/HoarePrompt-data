Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum GCD (balance) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.
2. The solution iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` to find the possible values of the GCD.
3. For each integer `i` from 1 to \(\sqrt{x}\), it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be used as the GCD, ensuring that the number of sub-problems (`n`) is less than or equal to the corresponding value.
4. This approach ensures that the maximum possible GCD is found by checking both the divisor and the quotient.
5. The output is correct as it prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance.

Correctness: **True**
