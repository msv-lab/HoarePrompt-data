The function `func` reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`. It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` to find the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` that satisfies certain conditions related to `n`. Finally, it prints the maximum value found. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case.
