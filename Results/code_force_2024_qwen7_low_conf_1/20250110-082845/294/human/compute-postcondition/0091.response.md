The code snippet `current_xor ^= a[i - 1]` updates the value of `current_xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `a[i - 1]`. However, since the initial values of `current_xor` and `a[i - 1]` are not provided, we can only describe the operation in a general form.

Output State: **`current_xor` is updated to the result of `current_xor ^ a[i - 1]`**
