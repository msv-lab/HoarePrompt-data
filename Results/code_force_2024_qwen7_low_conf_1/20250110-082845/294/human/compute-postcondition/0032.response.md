Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is `current_xor ^ a[i] ^ a[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `segment_count` is either the same or increased by 1 based on the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` ≤ `x`, and `valid` is `True`. If `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` ≤ `x`, then `current_xor` is set to 0 and `segment_count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change is made to `current_xor`, `i`, `segment_count`, and `valid` remains `True`.***
