Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is `prev_current_xor ^ a[3]`, `valid` is True, `prefix_xor` is a valid list for the range 1 to n, `segment_count` is 1, `i` is 5, `n` is a positive integer, `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `a`, `results`, `case` remain unchanged, if `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `current_xor` remains `prev_current_xor ^ a[3]`, `valid` remains False, `prefix_xor` remains a valid list for the range 1 to n, `segment_count` remains 0, `i` is 5, `n` is a positive integer, `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `a`, `results`, `case` remain unchanged.***
