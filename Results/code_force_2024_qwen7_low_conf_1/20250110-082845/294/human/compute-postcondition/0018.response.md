`current_xor` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is no longer equal to `a[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at `1`, and `segment_count` is increased by `1`. The condition `(current_xor | prefix_xor[n])` is less than or equal to `x` remains valid since `current_xor` is now `0`, and `prefix_xor[n]` does not change.

Output State: **`current_xor` is 0, `i` is 1, `segment_count` is increased by 1, and `(current_xor | prefix_xor[n])` is less than or equal to `x`**
