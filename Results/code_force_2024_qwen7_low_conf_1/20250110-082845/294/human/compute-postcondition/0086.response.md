Output State: **`current_xor` is 0 if a valid segment exists, otherwise it remains 0; `valid` is `True` if a valid segment exists, otherwise it remains `False`; `segment_count` is the number of valid segments found and is appended to `results` if `valid` is `True`; otherwise, `segment_count` is the number of valid segments found, `valid` is `False`, and `results` is a list containing -1; `prefix_xor` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element from `prefix_xor[1]` to `prefix_xor[n]` is updated to be `prefix_xor[i-1] ^ a[i-1]`; `i` is `n + 1`; `n` is a positive integer; `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `a`, and `case` remain unchanged.**
