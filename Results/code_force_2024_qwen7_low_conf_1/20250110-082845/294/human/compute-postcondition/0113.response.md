The code appends `-1` to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the `results` list, which now includes `-1`.

Output State: **`current_xor` is 0 if no condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x` was true, otherwise it is the result of XORing all `a[i - 1]` values from `i = 1` to `i = n`; `segment_count` is the number of times the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x` was true; `valid` is `False` if the condition was not true for the last iteration, otherwise it remains as `False`; `i` is `n + 1`; `prefix_xor` remains unchanged; `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `a`, and `case` remain unchanged; `results` now contains `-1`.**
