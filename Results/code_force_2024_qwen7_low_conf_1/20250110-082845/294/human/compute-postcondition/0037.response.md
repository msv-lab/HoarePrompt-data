The code snippet appends `-1` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_xor` is 0 if the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` is met at least once during the loop, otherwise it holds the result of XORing `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`; `segment_count` is the number of times the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` is met; `valid` is `False` since the condition is not met at least once; `prefix_xor` remains unchanged; `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `a` remain unchanged; `results` is a list containing `-1`.**
