The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the array `a`. The length of each array `a` is `n`, and the conditions are 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ `x` < 2^30, and 0 ≤ `a_i` < 2^30 for all `i`. Additionally, the sum of the values of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns a list called `results` which contains the `segment_count` for each valid segment found, otherwise it contains `-1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t` (a positive integer) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples), and returns a list `results` containing the `segment_count` for each valid segment found, otherwise it contains `-1`.**
