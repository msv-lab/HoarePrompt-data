Postcondition: **`current_xor` is 0 if the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` is met at least once during the loop, otherwise it holds the result of XORing `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`. `segment_count` is the number of times the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` is met. `valid` is `True` if the condition is met at least once, otherwise it is `False`. `prefix_xor` remains unchanged. `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `a` remain unchanged. Since `valid` is `True`, the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` has been met at least once.**
