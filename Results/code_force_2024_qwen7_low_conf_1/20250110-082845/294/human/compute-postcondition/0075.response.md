`results` is appended with the value `-1`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_xor` is 0, `valid` is False, `segment_count` is the number of valid segments found, `prefix_xor` is a valid list for the range 1 to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer if the loop executes, otherwise it is 0, `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `a`, `results` have been modified, `case` remains unchanged, and `results` is now a list containing `-1`.
