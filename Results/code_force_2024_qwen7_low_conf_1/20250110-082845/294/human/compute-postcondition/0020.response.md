Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is either `a[0]` or a value that satisfies the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x`. If the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x` is met, `i` is incremented by 1, `segment_count` is increased by 1, and `valid` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.***
