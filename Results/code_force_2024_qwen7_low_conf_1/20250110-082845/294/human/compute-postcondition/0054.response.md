Postcondition: **`current_xor` is `a[0]`, `valid` is False, `prefix_xor` is a valid list for the range 1 to n, `segment_count` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), (`current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`), `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `a`, `results`, `case` remain unchanged.**
