Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is 0 if a valid segment exists, otherwise it remains 0, `valid` is `True` if a valid segment exists, otherwise it remains `False`, `segment_count` is the number of valid segments found and is appended to `results` if `valid` is `True`; otherwise, `segment_count` is the number of valid segments found, `valid` is `False`, and `results` is a list containing -1, `prefix_xor` is a valid list for the range 1 to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer if the loop executes, otherwise it is 0, `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `a`, and `case` remain unchanged.***
