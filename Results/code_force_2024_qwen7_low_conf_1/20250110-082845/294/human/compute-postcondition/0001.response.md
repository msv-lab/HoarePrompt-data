To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop iterates over each element in the `test_cases` list. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.
2. Each tuple in `test_cases` should contain:
   - The first element (`n`) is an integer representing the number of elements in the array `a`.
   - The second element (`x`) is an integer.
   - The subsequent elements form the list `a`, which contains `n` integers.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments to the initial state are as follows:

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, so `t` must be at least 1.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, and since the loop must execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.
- Each tuple in `test_cases` must have at least three elements (corresponding to `n`, `x`, and the list `a`).

Thus, the required state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (at least 1), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, and `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple where each tuple has at least three elements (n, x, and the list a)**.
