Postcondition: **`current_xor` is either `a[2]` if it was 0, or `val ^ a[2]` where `val` is the original value of `current_xor`; `valid` is False; `prefix_xor` is a valid list for the range 1 to n; `segment_count` is 0; `i` is 3; `n` is a positive integer; `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `a`, `results`, `case` remain unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else cases provided.
