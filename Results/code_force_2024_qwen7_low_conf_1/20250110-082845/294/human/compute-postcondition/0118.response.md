Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the array `a`. For each test case, the function calculates the number of segments in the array `a` where the bitwise OR of the prefix XOR and the suffix XOR (computed up to the end of the array) is less than or equal to `x`. If such segments exist, it counts them; otherwise, it records `-1` for that test case. The function returns a list `results` containing the count of valid segments for each test case.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If no valid segments are found for any test case, the corresponding element in `results` will be `-1`.
- If `n` is zero, the function will treat it as a special case where no segments can be formed, and thus, the result for that test case will be `-1`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There are no missing functionalities in the provided code. All necessary calculations and conditions are present to determine the valid segments.
