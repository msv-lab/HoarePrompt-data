`n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values from the first tuple in the list `test_cases`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer; `test_cases` is a list of tuples; `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `test_cases` is a list of tuples; `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.**
