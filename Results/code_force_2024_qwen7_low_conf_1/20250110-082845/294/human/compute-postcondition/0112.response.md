Postcondition: **`current_xor` is 0 if no condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x` was true, otherwise it is the result of XORing all `a[i - 1]` values from `i = 1` to `i = n`. `segment_count` is the number of times the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x` was true. `valid` is `False` if the condition was not true for the last iteration, otherwise it remains as `False`. `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_xor` remains unchanged, and `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `a`, and `case` remain unchanged.**
