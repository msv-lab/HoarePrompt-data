The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the existing variables `t` or `test_cases`. Therefore, the only variable that has been updated is `results`, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers n and x, followed by a list of n integers representing the array a, and `results` is an empty list.**
