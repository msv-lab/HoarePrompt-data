Postcondition: **`current_xor` is 0, `valid` is False, `segment_count` is the number of valid segments found, `prefix_xor` is a valid list for the range 1 to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer if the loop executes, otherwise it is 0, `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `a`, `results`, `case` remain unchanged.**
