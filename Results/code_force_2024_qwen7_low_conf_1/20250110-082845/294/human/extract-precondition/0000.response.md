Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers n and x, followed by a list of n integers representing the array a. The length of each array a is n, and 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i. Additionally, the sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
