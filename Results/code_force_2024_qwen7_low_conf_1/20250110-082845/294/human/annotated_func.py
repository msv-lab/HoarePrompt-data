#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers n and x, followed by a list of n integers representing the array a. The length of each array a is n, and 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i. Additionally, the sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, a = case
        
        prefix_xor = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]
        
        current_xor = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        valid = False
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            current_xor ^= a[i - 1]
            if current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x:
                segment_count += 1
                current_xor = 0
                valid = True
        
        if valid:
            results.append(segment_count)
        else:
            results.append(-1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `current_xor` is 0 if the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x` is met for any segment, otherwise it is the result of XORing all elements from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`. `valid` is `True` if the condition is met for at least one segment, otherwise it is `False`. `segment_count` is the number of segments where the condition `current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x` is true. `results` contains the `segment_count` for each valid segment found, otherwise it contains `-1`. `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `case` remain unchanged.
    return results
    #`results` which contains the `segment_count` for each valid segment found, otherwise it contains `-1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the array `a`. For each test case, the function calculates the number of segments in the array `a` where the bitwise OR of the prefix XOR and the suffix XOR (computed up to the end of the array) is less than or equal to `x`. If such segments exist, it counts them; otherwise, it records `-1` for that test case. The function returns a list `results` containing the count of valid segments for each test case.
