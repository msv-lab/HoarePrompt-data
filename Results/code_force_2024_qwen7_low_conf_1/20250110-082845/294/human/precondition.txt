t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers n and x, followed by a list of n integers a. The length of each list a is n, and 1 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= x < 2^30, and 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
