Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and organizes it into test cases.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to solve the problem by iterating through the array and using prefix XOR to check the conditions specified in the problem.
3. The logic within `func_1`:
   - Initializes a prefix XOR array to store cumulative XOR values.
   - Iterates through the array to calculate these prefix XOR values.
   - Uses a sliding window approach to check if the XOR of the current segment and the remaining part of the array (using the prefix XOR) is within the limit `x`.
   - Keeps track of the number of valid segments found.
4. The program correctly handles edge cases such as when no valid segments can be formed, and it outputs `-1` in such scenarios.
5. The overall structure and logic of the program match the requirements of the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
