Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem statement.
2. It processes each test case individually by extracting the necessary parameters (`n`, `x`, and the array `a`).
3. The function `func_1` computes the prefix XOR for the array and iterates through the array to find valid segments.
4. For each segment, it checks if the bitwise OR of the current segment's XOR and the overall array's XOR is within the limit `x`.
5. The logic in the function seems to correctly identify valid segments and count them.
6. The output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Given the explanation above, the program appears to correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
