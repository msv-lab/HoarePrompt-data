### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Organization:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and organizes it into test cases.
   - It uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then splits the data accordingly, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each test case and calculates the prefix XOR values for the array `a`.
   - The prefix XOR array `prefix_xor` is initialized with zeros and then filled with cumulative XOR values.
   - The function then uses a sliding window approach to check the conditions specified in the problem:
     - It calculates the XOR of the current segment and the remaining part of the array using the prefix XOR.
     - It checks if this XOR value is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If the condition is met, it increments the `segment_count` and resets `current_xor` to zero.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where no valid segments can be formed by setting `valid` to `False` and appending `-1` to `results`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the `results` list, which contains the maximum number of valid segments for each test case or `-1` if no valid segments are found.
   - The main program then prints the results for each test case.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic of the program matches the requirements of the problem statement.
   - The use of prefix XOR and the sliding window approach is correct and efficient for solving the problem.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles all necessary edge cases.
