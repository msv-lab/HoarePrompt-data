Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input and splits it into test cases, each consisting of an array `a` and an integer `x`.
2. The function `func_1` processes each test case to find the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem statement.
3. The function uses a prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the XOR of subarrays.
4. For each test case, it iterates through the array to find valid segments and updates the segment count accordingly.
5. The logic in the function correctly handles the conditions for valid segments and computes the correct result for each test case.
6. The function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no logical errors or discrepancies between the problem requirements and the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
