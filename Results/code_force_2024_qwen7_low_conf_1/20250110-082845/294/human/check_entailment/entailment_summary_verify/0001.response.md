Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and organizes it into test cases. This part is implemented correctly using `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the data accordingly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The function initializes a prefix XOR array correctly to store cumulative XOR values. This is done efficiently using a loop.
   - **Sliding Window Approach**: The function iterates through the array to compute the current XOR value and checks if the condition `(current_xor | prefix_xor[n]) <= x` holds true. This part of the logic is sound and follows the problem requirements.
   - **Segment Counting**: The function correctly increments the `segment_count` whenever a valid segment is found and resets the `current_xor` to zero.
   - **Result Compilation**: The function compiles the results correctly by appending `-1` if no valid segments are found for a test case and appends the count of valid segments otherwise.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where no valid segments can be formed by returning `-1` appropriately.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the results for each test case correctly, as required.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`, and the program's implementation aligns with the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
