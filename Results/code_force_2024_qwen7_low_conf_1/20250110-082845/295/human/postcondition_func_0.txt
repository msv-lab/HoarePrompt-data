The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and an array `a` of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). For each test case, it sorts the array `a` and calculates the median. It then iterates through the second half of the array, counting the number of elements that are less than `median + 1`, and accumulates these differences into a variable `operations`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, which are the accumulated `operations` values for each test case.
