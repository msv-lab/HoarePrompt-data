Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the given array. An operation allows increasing any element `a_i` by 1.

2. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median of an array of size `n` is the element at position `(n - 1) // 2` in the sorted version of the array. This formula correctly calculates the middle index for both even and odd lengths of the array.
   
3. **Current Median Identification**:
   - The code correctly identifies the current median by sorting the array and finding the value at the middle index.

4. **Operations Calculation**:
   - The code iterates from the median index to the end of the array (`i` from `median_index` to `n-1`). For each element less than `median + 1`, it calculates the number of operations needed to make that element equal to `median + 1`. 
   - This approach ensures that we only count operations needed to make elements greater than the current median equal to the next integer value, which is the minimal change required to potentially increase the median.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as arrays with even or odd lengths and duplicate elements correctly, as the formula for the median index works for both cases.
   - The logic of counting operations to increment elements to the next integer value after the median is sound and will minimize the total number of operations.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the code is correct and aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
