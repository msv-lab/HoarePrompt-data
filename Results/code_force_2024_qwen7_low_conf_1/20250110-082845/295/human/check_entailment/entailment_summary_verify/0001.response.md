### Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the given array. An operation allows increasing any element `a_i` by 1.

2. **Median Calculation**:
   - The code correctly identifies the median using the formula `(n - 1) // 2`. This formula correctly calculates the middle index for both even and odd lengths of the array.

3. **Current Median Identification**:
   - The code correctly sorts the array and finds the value at the middle index, which is the current median.

4. **Operations Calculation**:
   - The code iterates from the median index to the end of the array (`i` from `median_index` to `n-1`). For each element less than `median + 1`, it calculates the number of operations needed to make that element equal to `median + 1`.
   - However, the logic for calculating the number of operations is flawed. The code adds `median + 1 - a[i]` for each element less than `median + 1`. This logic assumes that each element needs to be incremented to `median + 1`, but it doesn't account for the fact that some elements might already be equal to or greater than `median + 1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as arrays with even or odd lengths and duplicate elements correctly, as the formula for the median index works for both cases.
   - However, the logic for counting operations to increment elements to the next integer value after the median is not sound. The code does not ensure that the operations are minimized. For example, if an element is already equal to or greater than the current median, no operations are needed for those elements, and they should not be counted.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the code is flawed because it does not correctly minimize the number of operations. The code increments all elements less than `median + 1` to `median + 1`, which may not be the optimal solution.

### Final Evaluation

Given the points above, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the minimum number of operations is flawed and does not ensure that the operations are minimized.

**Final: False**
