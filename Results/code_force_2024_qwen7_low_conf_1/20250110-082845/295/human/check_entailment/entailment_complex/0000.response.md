Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of an array by incrementing any element by 1. Each test case involves multiple arrays and the goal is to determine the minimum operations required for each array's median.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - The array is sorted to easily find the median.
   - The median is calculated using the formula `(n - 1) // 2`.
   - The program then iterates from the median index to the end of the array, counting how many elements are less than `median + 1` and accumulating the difference between `median + 1` and the current element to get the total number of operations required to make the median `median + 1`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly sorts the array to find the median.
   - The logic to count the number of elements less than `median + 1` and calculate the total operations is accurate.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the median might be the maximum element in the array. If the median is already the maximum element, no operations are needed.
   - The program also handles cases where the array is small and the median is the smallest element.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
