According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

To summarize the states that need to be adjusted:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `a` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `median_index` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `median` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `operations` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `results` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all \(i\) in the range \([median_index, n-1]\) such that \(a[i] < median + 1\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`**
