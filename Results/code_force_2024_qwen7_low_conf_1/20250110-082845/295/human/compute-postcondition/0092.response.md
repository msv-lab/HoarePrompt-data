The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will handle a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (the number of test cases), followed by `t` sets of inputs. Each set includes an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`), and an array `a` of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.

Based on the provided output cases, the function does not seem to return a single value but rather processes each test case independently and could potentially return different outputs for each test case. However, since the specific return values are not detailed, we can only describe the inputs accepted by the function for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in `a` is between 1 and \(10^9\).**
