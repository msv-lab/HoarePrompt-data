Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be at least 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\).
   - `median` is \(a[median_index]\).
   - `operations` is updated to \(0 + (median + 1 - a[i])\) if \(a[i] < median + 1\). Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged.
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.

2. **Loop Range:**
   - The loop runs from `median_index` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `median_index` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states:

- `t` must still be greater than 0 because the value of `t` is not modified within the loop.
- `n` must still be at least 3 because the value of `n` is not modified within the loop.
- `a` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `median_index` remains \((n - 1) // 2\) because the value of `median_index` is not modified within the loop.
- `median` remains \(a[median_index]\) because the value of `median` is not modified within the loop.
- `operations` is updated based on the condition \(a[i] < median + 1\). However, since the loop has ended, we don't know the exact value of `operations` without the loop body. But we can infer that the loop has processed all elements from `median_index` to `n-1`.
- `results` contains the value of `operations` for each iteration where the condition was met. Since the loop has ended, `results` will contain the final values of `operations`.

Since the loop has ended, `i` will be `n-1` and the loop will not execute again unless `n` changes or `i` changes outside the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is updated based on the loop condition, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for each valid `i`.**

However, to clearly state the necessary adjustments for the next potential iteration:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is updated based on the loop condition, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.** 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now `n-1`, the loop cannot execute again without changing `i` or `n`. Therefore, the states remain as stated above.
