The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 2, so after this operation, `cnt` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `m`, `a`, and `n`) remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `m` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is even or `n // 2 + 2` if `n` is odd, `cnt` is 3, `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 5]` if `n` is even or `[1, 2, 4, 5]` if `n` is odd, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`.**
