According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0 and within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Before the loop starts, `results` is an empty list, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly since the loop increments based on `t`.

So, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0 and within the given range.

State: **`t` is an integer value entered by the user that must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
