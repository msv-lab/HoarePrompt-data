Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and an array `a` of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). For each test case, it sorts the array `a` and calculates the median. It then iterates through the second half of the array, counting the number of elements that are less than `median + 1`, and accumulates these differences into a variable `operations`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, which are the accumulated `operations` values for each test case.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), but the code itself does not enforce this constraint.
- The code assumes that `n` is always greater than 1, so there is no handling for the case when `n` is 1.
- The code correctly handles the case where `n` is even by using the floor division to find the median index, but it should also handle the case where `n` is odd to ensure accuracy.
- The code does not check if the input values for `t`, `n`, and `a` are within the specified ranges before processing them, which could lead to errors if invalid input is provided.
