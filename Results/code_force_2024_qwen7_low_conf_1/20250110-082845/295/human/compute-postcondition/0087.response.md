The code `print(cnt)` prints the value of `cnt`. Since `cnt` is defined as `n - 1`, the print statement will output the value of `n - 1`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `m`, `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `m` is `n`, `cnt` is `n - 1`, `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 5]` or `[1, 2, 4, 5]` based on `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`. After executing the print statement, `cnt` is printed as `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `m` is `n`, `cnt` is `n - 1`, `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 5]` or `[1, 2, 4, 5]` based on `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`. Additionally, the value of `cnt` (which is `n - 1`) is printed.**
