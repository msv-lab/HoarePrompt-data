The code `median_index = (n - 1) // 2` calculates the `median_index` based on the value of `n`. This does not change the value of `median` or any other variables. It simply updates the value of `median_index`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order
- `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\)
- `median` is \(a[median_index]\)
- `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all \(i\) in the range \([median_index, n-1]\) such that \(a[i] < median + 1\)
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`

After executing the line of code `median_index = (n - 1) // 2`, the value of `median_index` is updated to \((n - 1) // 2\), but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all \(i\) in the range \([median_index, n-1]\) such that \(a[i] < median + 1\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.**
