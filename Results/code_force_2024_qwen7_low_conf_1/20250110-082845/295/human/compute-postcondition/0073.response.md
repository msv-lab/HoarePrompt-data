`cnt` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `t`, `m`, and `a` remains unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer; `m` is either `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even or `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `cnt` is `1`; `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 4]` if `n` is even or `[1, 2, 4, 4]` if `n` is odd.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `m` is either `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even or `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `cnt` is `1`; `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 4]` if `n` is even or `[1, 2, 4, 4]` if `n` is odd.**
