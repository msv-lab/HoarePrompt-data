The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cnt` is 3, so the new value of `cnt` is 4. The states of the other variables (`t`, `m`, `n`, `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `m` is `n`, `cnt` is 4, `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 5]` or `[1, 2, 4, 5]` based on `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`.**
