Postcondition: ***`t > 0`, `n >= 3`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is updated to include the value of `a[median_index] + 1 - a[i]` if `a[i] < median + 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `median_index + 1` if the condition `a[i] < median + 1` is true. Otherwise, the same conditions hold as the precondition.***
