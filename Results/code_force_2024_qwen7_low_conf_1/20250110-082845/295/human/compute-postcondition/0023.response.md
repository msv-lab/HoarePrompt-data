The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `median_index`, `median`, `operations`, and `results`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Since the input is handled by `input().split()`, the new value of `a` depends on the input provided by the user. However, we know that `n` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), and `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `t`, `median_index`, `median`, `operations`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order with a new value due to the input; `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\); `median` is \(a[median_index]\); `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all \(i\) in the range \([median_index, n-1]\) such that \(a[i] < median + 1\); `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order with a new value due to the input; `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\); `median` is \(a[median_index]\); `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all \(i\) in the range \([median_index, n-1]\) such that \(a[i] < median + 1\); `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.**
