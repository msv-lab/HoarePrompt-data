The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a`. Initially, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Sorting this list in ascending order results in `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (which is already sorted). The other variables (`t`, `m`, `cnt`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `m` is either `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even or `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `cnt` is set to `n - 1`; `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`**
