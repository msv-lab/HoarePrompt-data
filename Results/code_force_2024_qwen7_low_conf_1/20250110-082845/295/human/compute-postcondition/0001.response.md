The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, the only variable affected is `results`, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value entered by the user, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `results` is an empty list**
