Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `median_index + 1`, `median` is `a[median_index]`, `operations` is the original `operations` value plus `median + 1 - a[i]` where `i` is `median_index + 1`. This holds true whether `a[i]` is less than `median + 1` or not since the else part is not specified and thus does not change the conditions.***
