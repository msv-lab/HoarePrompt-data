The code snippet `results.append(operations)` appends the value of `operations` to the list `results`. However, the initial state does not specify what `results` is, only that it is a list. Since no value is assigned to `results` before this line of code, `results` will be an empty list initially.

After executing the line `results.append(operations)`, the value of `results` will be a list containing one element, which is the value of `operations`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median`, and `operations`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all \(i\) in the range \([median_index, n-1]\) such that \(a[i] < median + 1\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.**
