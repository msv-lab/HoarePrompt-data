The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This operation changes the value of `a` but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `median_index`, `median`, `operations`, and `results`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (must be at least 3), `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all `i` where \(i\) ranges from `median_index` to `n-1` and `a[i] < median + 1\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` after each iteration, and `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**
