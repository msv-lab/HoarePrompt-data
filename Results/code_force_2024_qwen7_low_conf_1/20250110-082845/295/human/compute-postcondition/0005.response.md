The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in the list `a`, we can only say that the list `a` will be sorted. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order.**
