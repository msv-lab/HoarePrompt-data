The code initializes `operations` to 0. This means that `operations` is set to 0, effectively resetting it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (must be at least 3), `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is the element at index \((n - 1) // 2\) in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` after each iteration, and `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from user input.**
