Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `m` is either `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even or `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `cnt` is `n - 1`; `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 4]` if `n` is even or `[1, 2, 4, 4]` if `n` is odd. If `a[m - 1] <= a[m] and a[m] <= a[m + 1]`, then `m` remains as is, `cnt` remains as `n - 1`, and `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `m` is set to `n`, `cnt` is `n - 1`, `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 5]` or `[1, 2, 4, 5]` based on `n`, and the value of `cnt` (which is `n - 1`) is printed.**
