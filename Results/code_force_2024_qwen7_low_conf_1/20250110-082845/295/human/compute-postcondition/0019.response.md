Output State: **`t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all \(i\) in the range \([median_index, n-1]\) such that \(a[i] < median + 1\).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from `median_index` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, if `a[i] < median + 1`, `operations` is incremented by `(median + 1 - a[i])`.
- The loop will continue to increment `i` until it reaches the end of the list or all elements in the specified range have been processed.
- After the loop completes, `operations` will hold the sum of all values added during the iterations, which is \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all valid `i`.

Since the loop will iterate through all elements from `median_index` to `n-1` (inclusive), the final value of `operations` will be the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all `i` in the range \([median_index, n-1]\) where \(a[i] < median + 1\). If no such elements exist, `operations` will simply retain its initial value of 0.
