The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, after executing this line, `t` is now specifically the integer value entered by the user, which still falls within the range `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. The other preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value entered by the user, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
