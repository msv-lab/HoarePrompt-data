Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 3, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is the element at index \((n - 1) // 2\) in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is updated to `operations + median + 1 - a[i]` if `a[i] < median + 1`, `results` is a list containing the updated value of `operations` after the iteration, `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `i` is \( n - 1 \), and `i` must be less than \( n \).***
