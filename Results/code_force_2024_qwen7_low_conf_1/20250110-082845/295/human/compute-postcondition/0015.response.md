Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\); `median` is \(a[median_index]\); `operations` is the original `operations` value plus \((median + 1 - a[i])\) where `i` is `median_index + 1`.***
