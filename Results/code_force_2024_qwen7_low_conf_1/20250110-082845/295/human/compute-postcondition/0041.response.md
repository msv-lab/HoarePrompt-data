`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user, while the other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `t` must be greater than 1 and `n` must be at least 3 still holds.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (must be at least 3), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all `i` where \(i\) ranges from `median_index` to `n-1` and `a[i] < median + 1\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` after each iteration and the current value of `operations` is appended.**
