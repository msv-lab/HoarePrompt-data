The code calculates the `median_index` using the formula `(n - 1) // 2`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. The `median_index` is computed based on the current value of `n`.

Since `n` is an integer value between \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and `a` is a sorted list of integers, the `median_index` is updated based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`**
