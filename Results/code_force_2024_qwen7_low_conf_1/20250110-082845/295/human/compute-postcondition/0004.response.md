`a` is assigned the values from the input split into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user**
