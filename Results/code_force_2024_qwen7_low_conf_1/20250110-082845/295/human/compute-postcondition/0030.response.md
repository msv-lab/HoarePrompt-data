`operations` is incremented by the value of `median + 1 - a[i]`. Given that `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`, the value of `median + 1 - a[i]` will be positive. The exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `median` and `a[i]`, but it is known that it is a positive number. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is \(0 + (median + 1 - a[i])\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.**
