The code `m = n // 2` updates the value of `m`. According to the initial state, `m` was either `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even or `n // 2` if `n` is odd. Now, `m` is explicitly set to `n // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `m` is `n // 2`; `cnt` is set to `n - 1`; `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`**
