Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is updated to include the value of `median + 1 - a[i]` if `a[i] < median + 1`, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.***
