Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `m` is `n`, `cnt` is `n - 1`, `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 5]` or `[1, 2, 4, 5]` based on `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`. Additionally, the value of `cnt` (which is `n - 1`) is printed. If `a[m] > a[m + 1]`, this condition holds true. If `a[m] <= a[m + 1]`, no additional information is provided since there is no else part in the code.***
