The code `results.append(operations)` appends the current value of `operations` to the list `results`. This operation does not change the value of `operations` or any other variables directly. The only change is that `results` now contains one additional element, which is the current value of `operations`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer at least 3, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is the element at index \((n - 1) // 2\) in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is the total number of increments made to it during the loop, `results` is a list containing the updated value of `operations` after each iteration (now with one more element), and `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from user input.**
