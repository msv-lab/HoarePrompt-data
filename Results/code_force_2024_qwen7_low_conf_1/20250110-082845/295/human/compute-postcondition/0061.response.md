The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will take input through other means not directly passed as arguments (such as global variables, command-line arguments, or input from a user). The functionality of the function involves processing a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and an array `a` of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

After processing each test case, the function may return a value or perform some operation based on the input. However, without more specific details on the exact operations or outputs, we can only state the input requirements.
