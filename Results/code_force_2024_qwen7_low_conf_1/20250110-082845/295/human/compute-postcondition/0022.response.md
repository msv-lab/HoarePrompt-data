The code snippet assigns the value of the input to `n`. This means `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all \(i\) in the range \([median_index, n-1]\) such that \(a[i] < median + 1\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the integer value entered by the user.**
