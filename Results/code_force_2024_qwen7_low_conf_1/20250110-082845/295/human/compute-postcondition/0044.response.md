The code `median_index = (n - 1) // 2` simply reassigns the value of `median_index` based on the current value of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer and must be at least 3, the value of `median_index` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (must be at least 3), `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is the element at index `median_index` in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is recalculated as the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all `i` where \(i\) ranges from `median_index` to `n-1` and `a[i] < median + 1\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` after each iteration, and `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `median_index` is reassigned as \((n - 1) // 2\).**
