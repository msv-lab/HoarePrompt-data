Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\).
   - `median` is \(a[median_index]\).
   - `operations` is 0.
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `median_index` to `n-1`, inclusive. Therefore, the loop can only execute if there are elements in the list `a` from `median_index` to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to ensure that `median_index` is a valid index in the list `a`. Since `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), we need to confirm that this index is within the bounds of the list `a`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is large enough such that `median_index` is less than `n`, allowing the loop to run.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be large enough to allow `median_index` to be a valid index in the list `a`. Specifically, \(n\) must be at least 3 (since \((n - 1) // 2\) should be a valid index).
- `a` is a list of integers that is sorted in ascending order.
- `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\).
- `median` is \(a[median_index]\).
- `operations` is 0.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.

Therefore, the required states are:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`**
