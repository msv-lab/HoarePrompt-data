The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value entered by the user (which must be between 1 and \(10^4\)) to the variable `n`. The value of `t` is not affected by this operation, so it remains as an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
