`m` is incremented by 1. Since `m` was originally defined based on `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, the new value of `m` is now `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `m` is `n`, `cnt` is 3, `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 5]` or `[1, 2, 4, 5]` based on `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`.**
