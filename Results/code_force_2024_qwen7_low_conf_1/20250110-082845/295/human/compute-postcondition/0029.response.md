Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`. The current value of `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`**
