The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial value of `cnt` is 1, so after the code is executed, `cnt` will be 2. The other variables (`t`, `m`, `a`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `m` is `n // 2` if `n` is even or `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd; `cnt` is 2; `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 4]` if `n` is even or `[1, 2, 4, 4]` if `n` is odd, and `a[m + 1] > a[m]`.**
