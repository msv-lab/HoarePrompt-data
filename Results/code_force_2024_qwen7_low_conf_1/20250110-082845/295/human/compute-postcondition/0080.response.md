The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `m` is defined as `n // 2` if `n` is even or `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd. Since `m` is incremented by 1, the new value of `m` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is even or `n // 2 + 2` if `n` is odd. The values of the other variables (`t`, `cnt`, `a`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `m` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is even or `n // 2 + 2` if `n` is odd, `cnt` is 2, `a` is either `[1, 3, 3, 5]` if `n` is even or `[1, 2, 4, 5]` if `n` is odd, and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`.**
