The code `results.append(operations)` appends the current value of `operations` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the current value of `operations` to the `results` list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all `i` where \(i\) ranges from `median_index` to `n-1` and `a[i] < median + 1\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` after each iteration, and `results` now includes the current value of `operations`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is the sum of \((median + 1 - a[i])\) for all `i` where \(i\) ranges from `median_index` to `n-1` and `a[i] < median + 1\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` after each iteration and the current value of `operations` is appended.**
