Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is \(a[median_index]\), `operations` is incremented by `(median + 1 - a[i])` if `a[i] < median + 1`, and `i` remains `median_index` in both cases.***
