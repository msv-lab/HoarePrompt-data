The code assigns the value of `a[median_index]` to `median`. Given that `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, the value of `median` is the element at the index `(n - 1) // 2` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `median` is `a[median_index]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value entered by the user that satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `median` is `a[median_index]`**.
