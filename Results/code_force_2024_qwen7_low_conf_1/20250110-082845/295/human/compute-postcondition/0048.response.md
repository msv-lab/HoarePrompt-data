Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 3, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `median` is the element at index \((n - 1) // 2\) in the sorted list `a`, `operations` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` after each iteration, and `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from user input. The current value of `i` satisfies \(a[i] < \text{median} + 1\)**
