Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program adheres to the specifications:

1. **Reading Input and Generating Magic Words:**
   - The program reads the integer `n` indicating the number of magic words to generate.
   - It generates `n` distinct magic words, each consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'.
   - The length of each word is randomly chosen between 1 and 30 * n.
   - These magic words are printed to the standard output.

2. **Handling Queries:**
   - The program reads the number of queries `q`.
   - For each query, it reads the power `p_j` of a spell.
   - It then uses `func_3` to determine the indices `u` and `v` of the magic words used to create the spell with the given power.
   - It prints these indices `u` and `v`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function generates `n` distinct magic words as required.
   - It ensures that each magic word is a string of 'X' and 'O' with a length between 1 and 30 * n.
   - The function guarantees that the words are distinct by the nature of the random generation and the fact that the length and content are determined independently.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the number of non-empty substrings of a given string `s`.
   - It correctly computes the power of a spell by generating all possible non-empty substrings and counting them.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function takes a list of magic words and a power value.
   - It iterates over all pairs of magic words, concatenates them, and checks if the power matches the given power.
   - If a matching pair is found, it returns the indices of the words (1-based indexing).

Given that the problem description specifies that the input will be valid and the program handles all cases as described, the program meets the requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
