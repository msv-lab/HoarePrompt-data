### Reasoning:

1. **Magic Word Generation:**
   - The function `func_1` generates `n` distinct magic words, each of a random length between 1 and `30 * n`, consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'.
   - This part appears to be correct as it fulfills the requirement of generating `n` distinct magic words.

2. **Spell Power Calculation:**
   - The function `func_2` calculates the number of different non-empty substrings of a given spell.
   - This calculation seems accurate and is essential for verifying the power of a spell.

3. **Finding Magic Words from Spell Power:**
   - The function `func_3` tries to find the two indices `i` and `j` such that the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]` results in a spell with the given power.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the logic in `func_3`. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the indices returned are the ones originally chosen by the student. Instead, it simply finds any pair of indices whose concatenation results in the given power. This could lead to incorrect results if there are multiple pairs of magic words that produce the same spell power.

4. **Interaction Handling:**
   - The main part of the program reads the number of magic words `n` and prints them using `func_1`.
   - It then reads the number of students `q` and processes each student's query by reading the spell power `p_j` and calling `func_3` to find the indices.
   - The indices are then printed in the required format.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately by ensuring the lengths of the magic words and the interactions follow the specified rules.
   - The randomness in generating magic words ensures distinctness and variability, which is necessary for the problem.

Given that the core issue lies in `func_3`, where the function might return incorrect indices if multiple pairs of magic words produce the same spell power, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program may not always return the correct indices for a given spell power due to the potential for multiple pairs of magic words producing the same spell power.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
