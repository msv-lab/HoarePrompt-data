### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and compare it against the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Magic Word Generation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function generates `n` distinct magic words, each of which can have a length between 1 and \(30 \times n\) characters.
   - Each character in the word is chosen randomly from 'X' and 'O'.
   - The words are stored in a list and returned.

2. **Spell Power Calculation (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of distinct non-empty substrings of a given spell.
   - It uses a set to store unique substrings and then returns the size of the set.

3. **Spell Reconstruction (`func_3`)**:
   - This function takes a list of magic words and a spell power as input.
   - It iterates over all possible pairs of magic words, concatenates them, and calculates the power of the resulting spell using `func_2`.
   - If the calculated power matches the given power, it returns the 1-based indices of the two words that were concatenated to form the spell.
   - If no match is found, it returns `(-1, -1)`.

#### Validation of the Original Assessment:

1. **Magic Word Generation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly generates distinct magic words within the specified length constraints. This part is correct.

2. **Spell Power Calculation**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the power of a spell by generating all unique substrings. This part is correct.

3. **Spell Reconstruction**:
   - The function `func_3` iterates over all possible pairs of magic words, concatenates them, and checks if the resulting spell has the given power. If a match is found, it returns the correct indices. This logic is sound and addresses all possible combinations of words.

4. **Interaction Format**:
   - The program correctly handles the interaction format as described in the problem statement. It reads `n` and prints `n` magic words, followed by handling `q` queries by reading the power of the spell and returning the correct indices.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the function summaries.
