You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value
of n .

Professor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to
prepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string
consisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating
two magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its
different non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is
equal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and
XOXO.

Each student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.
Since the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of
the two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided
by Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a
student chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of
their spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,
and of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out
which two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.

Your program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n
distinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the
spell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the
correct order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.

Interaction

This is an interactive problem.

First, your program should read a single integer n (1 \le n \le 30 ), the
number of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has
created, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must
have at least 1 and at most 30\cdot n characters, and each character must be
either X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \le i
\le n ).

Then, your program should read a single integer q (1 \le q \le 1000 ), the
number of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process
q times, one per student.

For the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power
of their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two
indices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n
inclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of
different non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program
must print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \le u_j, v_j \le n ).

Note that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a
spell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student
in the exact order.

Remember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after
printing u_j and v_j for each student.

- Program:
import random
#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    magic_words = []
    for _ in range(n):
        length = random.randint(1, 30 * n)
        word = ''.join((random.choice(['X', 'O']) for _ in range(length)))
        magic_words.append(word)
    return magic_words

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    substrings = set()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substrings.add(s[i:j])
    return len(substrings)

#Function 3:
def func_3(magic_words, power):
    for i in range(len(magic_words)):
        for j in range(len(magic_words)):
            spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]
            if func_2(spell) == power:
                return (i + 1, j + 1)
    return (-1, -1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts a list of strings `magic_words` and an integer `power`. It iterates through all possible pairs of strings in `magic_words`, concatenates them, and checks if the `power` of the resulting spell matches the given `power`. If a matching spell is found, it returns the 1-based indices of the two parts of the spell. If no match is found after checking all pairs, it returns `(-1, -1)`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program follows the problem description accurately. Here's why:

1. **Magic Word Generation**: The `func_1` function generates `n` distinct magic words, each consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'. The length of each word is randomly determined within the specified bounds. This ensures that the magic words are distinct and meet the character constraints.

2. **Spell Power Calculation**: The `func_2` function calculates the power of a spell by generating all possible non-empty substrings and counting them. This is correct as it directly computes the required power.

3. **Spell Reconstruction**: The `func_3` function attempts to reconstruct the original magic words from a given spell power. It iterates through all pairs of magic words and checks if the combined spell matches the given power. If a match is found, it returns the indices of the two magic words. This logic is sound as it covers all possible combinations and matches based on the provided power.

Given the interaction format and the constraints, the program correctly handles the input and produces the expected output. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that the provided code does not address. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
