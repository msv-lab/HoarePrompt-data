### Reasoning:

1. **Magic Word Generation:**
   - The function `func_1` generates `n` distinct magic words, each of a random length between 1 and `30 * n`, consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'.
   - This part appears to be correct as it fulfills the requirement of generating `n` distinct magic words.

2. **Spell Power Calculation:**
   - The function `func_2` calculates the number of different non-empty substrings of a given spell.
   - This calculation seems accurate and is essential for verifying the power of a spell.

3. **Finding Magic Words from Spell Power:**
   - The function `func_3` tries to find the two indices `i` and `j` such that the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]` results in a spell with the given power.
   - It iterates over all pairs of magic words and checks if the power of the resulting spell matches the given power.
   - If a match is found, it returns the indices `(i+1, j+1)` (since indices start from 0 in the code but need to be adjusted to 1-based indexing for output).
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_3`. The function does not ensure that the magic words are distinct. If two magic words are the same, the function might return incorrect indices.

4. **Interaction Handling:**
   - The main part of the program reads the number of magic words `n` and prints them using `func_1`.
   - It then reads the number of students `q` and processes each student's query by reading the spell power `p_j` and calling `func_3` to find the indices.
   - The indices are then printed in the required format.
   - Despite the interaction handling, the core issue lies in the generation of the magic words.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately by ensuring the lengths of the magic words and the interactions follow the specified rules.
   - However, the randomness in generating magic words does not guarantee distinctness, especially when the length is large.

### Detailed Explanation:

Consider the following scenario:
- Suppose `n = 2`, and the generated magic words are `w1 = "XOXO"` and `w2 = "XOXO"`. Both `w1` and `w2` are identical.
- When calculating the power of the spell `w1 + w2`, the substring count will be the same as for `w1 + w2` even though the indices should be distinct.
- In this case, `func_3` would return `(1, 1)` instead of `(1, 2)` or `(2, 1)`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not ensure that the generated magic words are distinct. While the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` seem to be logically sound individually, the randomness in `func_1` does not guarantee distinctness, leading to potential errors in the output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
