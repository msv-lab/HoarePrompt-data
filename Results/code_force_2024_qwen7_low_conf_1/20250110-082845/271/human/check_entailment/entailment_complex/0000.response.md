Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly generates `n` distinct magic words, each consisting of characters 'X' and 'O' with lengths between 1 and 30 * n. Since the function ensures that all magic words are distinct, the generated list meets the requirements.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly calculates the number of unique non-empty substrings of a given string `s`. The logic of iterating over all possible substrings and storing them in a set to ensure uniqueness is sound.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function iterates through all possible pairs of magic words, concatenates them, and checks if the power of the resulting spell matches the given power. If a match is found, it returns the 1-based indices of the two parts of the spell. Given that the magic words and their concatenations are correctly handled by `func_1` and `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly identifies the correct indices when a match is found, the function should work as intended.

Given the interactions and the logic within each function, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem statement. It generates the required magic words, processes the queries correctly, and finds the correct indices of the magic words used by each student.

Correctness: **True**
