Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program follows the problem description accurately. Here's why:

1. **Magic Word Generation**: The `func_1` function generates `n` distinct magic words, each consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'. The length of each word is randomly determined within the specified bounds. This ensures that the magic words are distinct and meet the character constraints.

2. **Spell Power Calculation**: The `func_2` function calculates the power of a spell by generating all possible non-empty substrings and counting them. This is correct as it directly computes the required power.

3. **Spell Reconstruction**: The `func_3` function attempts to reconstruct the original magic words from a given spell power. It iterates through all pairs of magic words and checks if the combined spell matches the given power. If a match is found, it returns the indices of the two magic words. This logic is sound as it covers all possible combinations and matches based on the provided power.

Given the interaction format and the constraints, the program correctly handles the input and produces the expected output. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that the provided code does not address. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
