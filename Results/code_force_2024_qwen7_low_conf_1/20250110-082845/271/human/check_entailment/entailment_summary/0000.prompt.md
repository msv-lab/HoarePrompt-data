You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value
of n .

Professor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to
prepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string
consisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating
two magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its
different non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is
equal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and
XOXO.

Each student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.
Since the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of
the two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided
by Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a
student chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of
their spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,
and of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out
which two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.

Your program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n
distinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the
spell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the
correct order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.

Interaction

This is an interactive problem.

First, your program should read a single integer n (1 \le n \le 30 ), the
number of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has
created, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must
have at least 1 and at most 30\cdot n characters, and each character must be
either X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \le i
\le n ).

Then, your program should read a single integer q (1 \le q \le 1000 ), the
number of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process
q times, one per student.

For the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power
of their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two
indices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n
inclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of
different non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program
must print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \le u_j, v_j \le n ).

Note that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a
spell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student
in the exact order.

Remember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after
printing u_j and v_j for each student.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import random

n = int(input())
magic_words = func_1(n)
for word in magic_words:
    print(word)
print(flush=True)
q = int(input())
for _ in range(q):
    power = int(input())
    (u, v) = func_3(magic_words, power)
    print(u, v)
    print(flush=True)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    magic_words = []
    for _ in range(n):
        length = random.randint(1, 30 * n)
        word = ''.join((random.choice(['X', 'O']) for _ in range(length)))
        magic_words.append(word)
    return magic_words
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30. It generates a list named `magic_words` containing exactly `n` elements. Each element in the list is a string consisting of random characters 'X' or 'O', with the length of each string ranging from 1 to 30 * n. The function returns this list.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(s):
    substrings = set()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substrings.add(s[i:j])
    return len(substrings)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', and returns the total number of unique non-empty substrings of `s`. It achieves this by iterating over all possible substrings of `s` using two nested loops, adding each substring to a set to ensure uniqueness, and then returning the size of this set. The function covers all substrings of `s`, including those that start and end at the same index, and handles edge cases where the input string could be empty (though the problem statement guarantees the length of `s` is at least 1).
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(magic_words, power):
    for i in range(len(magic_words)):
        for j in range(len(magic_words)):
            spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]
            if func_2(spell) == power:
                return (i + 1, j + 1)
    return (-1, -1)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a list of strings `magic_words` and an integer `power`. It iterates through all possible pairs of strings in `magic_words`, concatenates them, and checks if the `power` of the resulting spell matches the given `power`. If a matching spell is found, it returns the 1-based indices of the two parts of the spell. If no match is found after checking all pairs, it returns `(-1, -1)`.
