According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings.
- `power` is an integer.
- `i` is any integer.
- `j` must be less than the length of `magic_words`.
- `spell` is the concatenated string of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`.
- `func_2(spell)` is not equal to `power`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than the length of `magic_words`. Therefore, `j` will become `j + 1`, and we need to ensure that `j + 1` is still less than the length of `magic_words`.

Let's denote the length of `magic_words` as `len_magic_words`. Since `j` was less than `len_magic_words`, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`, and for the loop to continue, `j + 1` must be less than `len_magic_words`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings.
- `power` is an integer.
- `i` is any integer.
- `j` must be less than `len_magic_words` (becomes `j + 1`).
- `spell` is the concatenated string of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j + 1]`.
- `func_2(spell)` is not equal to `power`.

State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is any integer, `j` must be less than `len(magic_words)`, `spell` is the concatenated string of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j + 1]`, and `func_2(spell)` is not equal to `power`**
