Postcondition: ***`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`, `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`, and the function returns `(i + 1, j + 1)` if `func_2(spell) == power`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.***
