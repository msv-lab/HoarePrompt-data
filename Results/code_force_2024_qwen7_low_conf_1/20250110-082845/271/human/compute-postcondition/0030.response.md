According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `len(magic_words)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is the last value of `i` it took in the loop (which could be `n-1`), `j` is the last value of `j` it took in the loop (which could be `n`), `spell` is either the concatenated string of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]` if a valid pair was found, or `i` is `n` and `j` is `n` if no valid pair is found, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(magic_words) - 1` because `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(magic_words) - 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. The state remains the same for `magic_words`, `power`, `j`, and `spell` as they will be reset in the next iteration.

State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `n`, `spell` is either the concatenated string of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]` if a valid pair was found, or `i` is `n` and `j` is `n` if no valid pair is found**
