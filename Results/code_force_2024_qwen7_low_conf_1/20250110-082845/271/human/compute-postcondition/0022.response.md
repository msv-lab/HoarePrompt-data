The code concatenates `magic_words[i]` with `magic_words[j]` and assigns the result to `spell`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition involving `func_2(spell)` is not relevant to the direct impact of the code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is any integer, `j` must be less than `len(magic_words)`, `spell` is the concatenated string of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`, and `func_2(spell)` is not equal to `power`**
