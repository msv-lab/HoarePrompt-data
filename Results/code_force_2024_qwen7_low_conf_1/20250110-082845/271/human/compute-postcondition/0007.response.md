`spell` is reassigned the value of `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the new value of `spell` will be `magic_words[0] + magic_words[1]`. The other variables (`magic_words`, `power`, `i`, `j`, and `func_2(spell)`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `spell` is `magic_words[0] + magic_words[1]`, and `func_2(spell) != power`**
