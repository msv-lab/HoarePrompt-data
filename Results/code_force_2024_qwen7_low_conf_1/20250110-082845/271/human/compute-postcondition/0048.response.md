Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts a list of strings `magic_words` and an integer `power`. It iterates through all possible pairs of strings in `magic_words`, concatenates them, and checks if the `power` of the resulting spell matches the given `power`. If a matching spell is found, it returns the 1-based indices of the two parts of the spell. If no match is found after checking all pairs, it returns `(-1, -1)`.**

This function performs the following actions:
- Iterates over all pairs of strings in `magic_words`.
- Concatenates each pair of strings.
- Checks if the `power` of the concatenated string matches the given `power`.
- If a match is found, it returns the 1-based indices of the two parts of the spell.
- If no match is found, it returns `(-1, -1)`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `magic_words` contains at least one string, which is implicitly covered by the condition that `power` is the power of some concatenation of two strings from `magic_words`.
- The function does not handle the case where `magic_words` is empty, although this is covered by the guarantee that `power` is the power of some concatenation, implying that `magic_words` must contain at least one valid pair.
- The function does not check for duplicate pairs; it only checks pairs `(i, j)` once. This means that if the same pair is encountered multiple times, the function will return the indices from the first occurrence only.
