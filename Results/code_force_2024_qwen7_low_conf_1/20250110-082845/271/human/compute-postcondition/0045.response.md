Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, `i` is the index of the found spell's first part, `j` is the index of the found spell's second part, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`, and if no such pair exists, `i` is `n` and `j` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible pairs of strings from the `magic_words` list. This means that every element in `magic_words` is paired with every other element (including itself).
- If a pair of strings (`magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`) is found such that the concatenated string `spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` satisfies the condition `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns the indices `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
- If no such pair is found, the loop will eventually complete its iterations without finding a valid pair. In this case, `i` and `j` will both be set to `n` because the loop will exit when it has exhausted all possible pairs.
- Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` and `j` will either be the indices of the valid pair that satisfies the condition or `n` and `n` if no such pair exists.
