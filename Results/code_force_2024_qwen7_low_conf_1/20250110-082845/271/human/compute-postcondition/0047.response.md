The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `magic_words`, which is a list of n distinct strings where each string consists of characters 'X' and 'O' and has a length between 1 and 30*n inclusive, and `power`, which is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, guaranteed to be the power of some concatenation of two strings from `magic_words`.

Based on the given cases, the function can return different outcomes:

- Case_1: Returns (1, 1)
- Case_2: Returns (1, 2)
- Case_3: Returns (2, 4)
- Case_4: Returns (i + 1, j + 1)
- Case_5: Returns (i + 1, j + 1)
- Case_6: Increments `i` by 1, increments `j` by 1, and returns (i + 1, j + 1)
- Case_7: Returns (i + 1, j + 1) where `i` is `i + 1` and `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`
- Case_8: Returns (i + 1, j + 1)
- Case_9: Returns `i` that is `i + 1` and `j` that is less than the length of `magic_words` but incremented by 1
- Case_10: Returns (-1, -1)

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of strings `magic_words` and an integer `power`. Depending on certain conditions, the function returns specific tuples or updates indices `i` and `j` before returning a tuple.
