Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is the last value of `i` it took in the loop (which could be `n`), `j` is the last value of `j` it took in the loop (which could be `n`), `spell` is either the concatenated string of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]` if a valid pair was found, or `i` is `n` and `j` is `n` if no valid pair is found, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `len(magic_words) - 1`.
- For each `j`, it checks if `func_2(magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]) == power`.
- If a match is found, the function returns immediately with the indices `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
- If no match is found after all iterations, the loop terminates and the function either returns nothing (implying the state remains unchanged) or returns the final values of `i` and `j`.

Since the loop can either find a match or not, the final values of `i` and `j` will be `n` if no match is found, and the indices of the matching pair if found. Therefore, the final state reflects these possibilities.
