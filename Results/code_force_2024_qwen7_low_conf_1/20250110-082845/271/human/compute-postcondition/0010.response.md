Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings.
   - `power` is an integer representing the power of a student's spell.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `spell` is updated to `magic_words[1] + magic_words[2]`.
   - The function ensures that `func_2(spell) != power`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(len(magic_words)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices of `magic_words`.
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 0 up to `len(magic_words) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment to the next value.
   - Since `j` started from 0, it will now be incremented to 3 if the loop is to continue.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is simply that `j` should be less than `len(magic_words)`.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `magic_words` remains unchanged.
   - `power` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged (1).
   - `j` will be updated to 3.
   - `spell` is not updated in this iteration but will be updated in the next iteration if the loop continues.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `spell` is updated to `magic_words[1] + magic_words[2]` if `func_2(spell) != power` still holds true.**
