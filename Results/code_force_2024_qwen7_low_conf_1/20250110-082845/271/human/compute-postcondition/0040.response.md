According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range of the length of `magic_words`. At the end of the last iteration, `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`, `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`, and the function returns `(i + 1, j + 1)` if `func_2(spell) == power`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than the length of `magic_words`.

State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is less than the length of `magic_words` (but incremented by 1), `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`**.
