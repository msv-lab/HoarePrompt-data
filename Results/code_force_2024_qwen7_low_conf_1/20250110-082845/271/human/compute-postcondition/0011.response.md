`spell` is assigned the value `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, this means `spell` is updated to `magic_words[1] + magic_words[3]`. The values of `power`, `magic_words`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `spell` is `magic_words[1] + magic_words[3]`**
