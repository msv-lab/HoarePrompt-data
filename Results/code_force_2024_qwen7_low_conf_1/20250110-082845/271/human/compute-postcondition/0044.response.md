Let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the provided information and the loop code.

### Initial State:
- `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings.
- `power` is an integer.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `j` is `n`.
- `spell` is either the concatenated string of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]` if a valid pair was found, or `i` is `n` and `j` is `n` if no valid pair is found.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(len(magic_words)):
    spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]
    if func_2(spell) == power:
        return i + 1, j + 1
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `len(magic_words) - 1`.
   - For each iteration, `spell` is set to the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`.
   - If `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns `i + 1, j + 1` and the loop terminates.
   - If the condition is not met, the loop continues until `j` reaches the length of `magic_words`.

2. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - If the loop finds a valid pair (`func_2(spell) == power`), it returns `i + 1` and `j + 1`.
   - If no valid pair is found, the loop will complete its iterations, and the function will return `None`.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop completes without finding a valid pair:
  - `magic_words` remains unchanged.
  - `power` remains unchanged.
  - `i` remains `i + 1` after the last iteration.
  - `j` is `len(magic_words)` since the loop exits when `j` equals the length of `magic_words`.
  - `spell` is the last checked combination `magic_words[i] + magic_words[len(magic_words) - 1]` if the loop did not return, otherwise it may not be defined.
- If the loop finds a valid pair:
  - `i` and `j` are returned as `i + 1` and `j + 1` respectively.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `len(magic_words)`, and `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]` if a valid pair was found, otherwise `spell` is undefined. If a valid pair is found, the function returns `i + 1` and `j + 1`.**
