According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than the length of `magic_words`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings.
- `power` is an integer.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`.
- `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`.
- The function `func_2(spell)` is not equal to `power`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it was less than the length of `magic_words` before, and now it should still be within bounds). Therefore, `j` will be `j + 1`.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`, and `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j + 1]`, and the function `func_2(concat(magic_words[i], magic_words[j + 1]))` is not equal to `power`**
