The code `spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` assigns the concatenation of the strings at indices `i` and `j` in the list `magic_words` to the variable `spell`. 

- The initial state indicates that `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` must be less than the length of `magic_words`.
- After executing the line `spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`, the variable `spell` now holds the concatenated string formed by combining `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`.
- The values of `magic_words`, `power`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `j` must still be less than the length of `magic_words`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`, and `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`.

Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`, and `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`.**
