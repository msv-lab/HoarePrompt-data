Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Control Variables**: The loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which iterates over the length of `magic_words`.

2. **Determine Initial Values**: Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `i + 1`, and `j` is set to `n`. This means `i` is initially one more than its expected starting value (which would typically be 0), and `j` is set to the length of `magic_words`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < len(magic_words)`.

4. **Initial State of `magic_words`**: `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings.

5. **Initial State of `power`**: `power` is an integer. Its initial value is not specified, but it doesn't affect the loop execution directly.

6. **Initial State of `i` and `j`**: Since `i` is set to `i + 1` and `j` is set to `n`, we need to ensure these values are consistent with the loop condition. Specifically, `j` must be less than the length of `magic_words` for the loop to start executing.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`. 

**Step-by-Step Adjustment**:
- Ensure `j` is less than the length of `magic_words` to allow the loop to start.
- `i` is already adjusted to `i + 1`, so we need to ensure `j` is within the valid range.

**State:**
- `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings.
- `power` is an integer (no specific adjustment needed).
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `j` must be less than the length of `magic_words`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` must be less than the length of `magic_words`**.
