Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, `i` is the index of the found spell's first part, `j` is the index of the found spell's second part, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`, and if no such pair exists, `i` is `n` and `j` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible pairs of strings in `magic_words` by using indices `i` and `j`.
- For each iteration, it constructs a `spell` by concatenating `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]` and checks if `func_2(spell)` equals `power`.
- If a match is found, the function returns the indices `i + 1` and `j + 1`, indicating the positions of the strings in the list.
- If no match is found after all iterations, the loop does not return anything, and the final values of `i` and `j` will be `n` and `n` respectively, indicating that no such pair was found.
