To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- The loop is iterating over `magic_words` using `j` as the index.
- The loop body is omitted.
- The function `func_2(spell)` is called within the loop.
- If `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns `i + 1` and `j + 1`.
- If `func_2(spell) != power`, the function does not return anything (or returns the original values of `i` and `j`).

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `magic_words`: Defined as per the precondition.
- `power`: Defined as per the precondition.
- `i` and `j`: Defined as per the precondition.
- `spell`: Defined as per the precondition.
- `func_2(spell)`: This value was used in the conditional check but its exact value is not specified.

### Analysis:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Since `j` is the index iterating through `magic_words`, it will increment by 1 in each iteration.
- The value of `i` will only change if `func_2(spell) == power` because in that case, the function returns `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` will be incremented by 1.
- `i` will remain the same unless `func_2(spell) == power`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and there is no explicit mention of modifying `i` unless `func_2(spell) == power`, we assume `i` remains unchanged unless the condition is met.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `i` remains the same (if `func_2(spell) != power`).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`magic_words`, `power`, `i` is as defined, `j` is incremented by 1, `spell` is as defined, and `func_2(spell)` is as defined**.

However, to provide a more precise answer based on the format:

State: **`magic_words`, `power`, `i` is as defined, `j` is incremented by 1, `spell` is as defined, and `func_2(spell)` is as defined.**
