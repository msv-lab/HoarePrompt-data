According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings.
- `power` is an integer representing the power of a student's spell.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `spell` is `magic_words[0] + magic_words[0]`.
- `func_2(spell) != power`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the length of `magic_words`. Since `j` starts at 0, it needs to be incremented by 1 to check the next element in the list.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be 1.
- `spell` remains unchanged as the loop body has not modified it.

The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `spell` is `magic_words[0] + magic_words[0]`, and `func_2(spell) != power`**
