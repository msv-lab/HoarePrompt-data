Postcondition: ***`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is less than the length of `magic_words` but incremented by 1, and `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`. If `func_2(spell) == power`, the program returns `i`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything (postconditions for variables remain unchanged).***
