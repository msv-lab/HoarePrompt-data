`spell` is assigned the value of `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`. The value of `i` and `j` have been incremented by 1 in the initial state, so they remain as such. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`magic_words` is unchanged, `power` is unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`, and `func_2(spell)` is as defined.**
