Postcondition: ***`magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `spell` is `magic_words[1] + magic_words[3]`. If `func_2(spell)` equals `power`, then `i` is set to 2 and `j` is set to 4. Otherwise, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.***
