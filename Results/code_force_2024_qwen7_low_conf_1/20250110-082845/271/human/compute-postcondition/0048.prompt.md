You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: magic_words is a list of n distinct strings, where each string consists of characters 'X' and 'O', and has a length between 1 and 30*n inclusive. power is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, which is guaranteed to be the power of some concatenation of two strings from magic_words.
def func_3(magic_words, power):
    for i in range(len(magic_words)):
        for j in range(len(magic_words)):
            spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]
            if func_2(spell) == power:
                return i + 1, j + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `magic_words` is a list of `n` distinct strings, `power` is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, `i` is the index of the found spell's first part, `j` is the index of the found spell's second part, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`, and if no such pair exists, `i` is `n` and `j` is `n`.
    return -1, -1
    #`-1, -1`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `magic_words`, which is a list of n distinct strings where each string consists of characters 'X' and 'O' and has a length between 1 and 30*n inclusive, and `power`, which is an integer representing the power of a student's spell, guaranteed to be the power of some concatenation of two strings from `magic_words`.
#
#Based on the given cases, the function can return different outcomes:
#
#- Case_1: Returns (1, 1)
#- Case_2: Returns (1, 2)
#- Case_3: Returns (2, 4)
#- Case_4: Returns (i + 1, j + 1)
#- Case_5: Returns (i + 1, j + 1)
#- Case_6: Increments `i` by 1, increments `j` by 1, and returns (i + 1, j + 1)
#- Case_7: Returns (i + 1, j + 1) where `i` is `i + 1` and `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`
#- Case_8: Returns (i + 1, j + 1)
#- Case_9: Returns `i` that is `i + 1` and `j` that is less than the length of `magic_words` but incremented by 1
#- Case_10: Returns (-1, -1)
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of strings `magic_words` and an integer `power`. Depending on certain conditions, the function returns specific tuples or updates indices `i` and `j` before returning a tuple.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the program returns (1, 1)

Case_2: `i` is 1, `j` is 2

Case_3: `i` is 2, `j` is 4

Case_4: `The program returns i + 1 and j + 1`

Case_5: `The program returns i + 1 and j + 1`

Case_6: `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and the program returns the tuple (i + 1, j + 1)

Case_7: `The program returns (i + 1, j + 1)` where `i` is `i + 1` and `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`

Case_8: `The program returns (i + 1, j + 1)`

Case_9: `The program returns i that is `i + 1` and j that is less than the length of `magic_words` but incremented by 1`

Case_10: `-1, -1`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
