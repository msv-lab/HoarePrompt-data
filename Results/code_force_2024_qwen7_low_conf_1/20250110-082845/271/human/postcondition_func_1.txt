The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', and returns the total number of unique non-empty substrings of `s`. It achieves this by iterating over all possible substrings of `s` using two nested loops, adding each substring to a set to ensure uniqueness, and then returning the size of this set. The function covers all substrings of `s`, including those that start and end at the same index, and handles edge cases where the input string could be empty (though the problem statement guarantees the length of `s` is at least 1).
