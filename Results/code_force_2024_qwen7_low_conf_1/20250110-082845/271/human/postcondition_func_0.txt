The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30. It generates a list named `magic_words` containing exactly `n` elements. Each element in the list is a string consisting of random characters 'X' or 'O', with the length of each string ranging from 1 to 30 * n. The function returns this list.
