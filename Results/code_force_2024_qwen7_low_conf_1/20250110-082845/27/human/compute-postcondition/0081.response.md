The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not modify any variables but rather breaks out of the loop or conditional structure it is in. Given the initial state, the variables `outs`, `t`, `trg`, `n`, `min_`, `min_idx`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `n` must be greater than 1, `min_` is `prev_min + k // i`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, `k` is `k % i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
