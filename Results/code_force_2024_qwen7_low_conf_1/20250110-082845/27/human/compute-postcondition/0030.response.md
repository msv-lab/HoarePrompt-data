`score` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to its current value. The values of `remaining_cards`, `remaining_coins`, and `max_score` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated `score` is `cards[2] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is `cards[2] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 3 plus `remaining_coins` appended, and `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
