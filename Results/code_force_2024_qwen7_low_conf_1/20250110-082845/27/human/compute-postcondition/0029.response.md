`remaining_cards` is a list that includes elements from `cards` excluding 3 plus `remaining_coins`. The value of `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`. The code appends `remaining_coins` to `remaining_cards`. Since `remaining_coins` is already defined, it is added to the list `remaining_cards`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is `cards[2] * n`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 3 plus `remaining_coins` appended, and `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
