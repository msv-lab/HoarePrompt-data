To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider its effects on the variables involved.

### Initial State
- `outs` is `[tot]`
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the value of the first input integer
- `k` is the value of the second input integer
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order
- `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`
- `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n` (exclusive), performing operations based on the value of `k` compared to `trg`, which is calculated as `i * (a[i] - min_)`.

#### Key Operations
1. **If Condition**: If `k >= trg`, then:
   - `k` is reduced by `trg`.
   - `min_` is updated to `a[i]`.
   - `min_idx` is updated to `i`.

2. **Else Condition**: If `k < trg`, then:
   - `k` is reduced by `k % i`.
   - `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // i`.
   - `min_idx` is updated to `i - 1`.
   - The loop breaks.

### Iteration Analysis
Let's consider what happens after each iteration until `k` is exhausted or the loop completes:

- Initially, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`.
- As the loop progresses, `min_` and `min_idx` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop.

### Final State
After the loop finishes executing all iterations:
- `t` will still be `t - 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` will be `0` since it is continuously reduced until it reaches `0`.
- `outs` remains `[tot]`.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order.
- `min_` will be the minimum value in the list `a` adjusted by the final value of `k // i` when the loop ends.
- `min_idx` will be the index of the new `min_` in the list `a`.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations is as follows:

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the value of the first input integer, `k` is `0`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted by the final value of `k // i` when the loop ends, `min_idx` is the index of the new `min_` in the list `a`.**
