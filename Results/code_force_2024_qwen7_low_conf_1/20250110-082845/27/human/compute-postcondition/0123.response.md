The code assigns the value of `i - 1` to `min_idx`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `a[i]`, `min_`, or `trg`. The only change is in the value of `min_idx`.

Output State: **`i` is its original value; `a[i]` is its original value; `min_` is its original value + `k // i`; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - (min_ + k // i))`; `min_idx` is `i - 1`**
