`outs.append(tot)` appends the value of `tot` to the list `outs`. The value of `tot` is given by the formula: `a[0] + k // n + k // n + (a[0] + k // n + k // n - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1) + k`.

Given that `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, and `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted by the final value of `k // n` plus `k // n`, and `min_idx` is the index of the new `min_` in the list `a`, these variables remain unchanged by this line of code.

Let's break down the formula for `tot`:
- `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list `a`.
- `k // n` gives the quotient of `k` divided by `n` without remainder.
- The term `(a[0] + k // n + k // n - 1) * (n - 1)` represents the sum of a sequence of `n-1` terms, each being `a[0] + k // n + k // n - 1`.
- `(n - 1) + k` adds the remaining part of `k` after the division by `n`.

Since the exact values of `a[0]`, `k`, and `n` are not specified, let's denote them as follows:
- `a[0]` as `min_a` (the minimum value in the list `a`).
- `k` remains `k`.
- `n` remains `n`.

Thus, `tot` can be expressed as:
\[ tot = min_a + k // n + k // n + (min_a + k // n + k // n - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1) + k \]

This simplifies to:
\[ tot = min_a + 2 \times (k // n) + (min_a + 2 \times (k // n) - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1) + k \]

Therefore, `outs` is updated to include the value of `tot` at the end.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot, tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the value of the first input integer, `k` is `k % n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted by the final value of `k // n` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of the new `min_` in the list `a`, and `tot` is calculated as `min_a + 2 \times (k // n) + (min_a + 2 \times (k // n) - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1) + k`.**
