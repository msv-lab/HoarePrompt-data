The code `score = num_cards * n` assigns the product of `num_cards` and `n` to the variable `score`. Based on the initial state, `num_cards` is `cards[2]` and `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, the new value of `score` is `cards[2] * n`.

Other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is `cards[2] * n`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`, and `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
