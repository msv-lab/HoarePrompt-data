`score` is assigned the value `num_cards * n`. From the initial state, we know that `num_cards` is `cards[0]` and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, `score` is set to `cards[0] * n`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - cards[0])`, `score` is `cards[0] * n`**
