The code assigns the value of `i` to `min_idx`. This means that `min_idx` now holds the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - trg`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[i]`, `min_idx` is `i`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`**
