The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the current loop or block of code. Based on the initial state and the fact that no variables are reassigned within the snippet, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`; `min_` is updated by adding `k // i`; the value of `k` is now `k % i`; `min_idx` is `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.**
