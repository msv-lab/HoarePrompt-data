The code assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `min_idx`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `trg`, `k`, `trg`, `min_`, or `i` itself. The only new information we get is that `min_idx` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `k` is greater than or equal to `trg - trg`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` is `a[i]`, `min_idx` is `i`**
