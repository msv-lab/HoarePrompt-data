The code snippet `trg = i * (a[i] - min_)` assigns the value of `i * (a[i] - min_)` to the variable `trg`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, `a`, and `min_`. Therefore, the only thing we can definitively say is that `trg` is now the product of `i` and the difference between `a[i]` and `min_`.

Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than 1, this precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`**
