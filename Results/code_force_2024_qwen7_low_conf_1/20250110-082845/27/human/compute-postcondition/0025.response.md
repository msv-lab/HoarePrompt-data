The code assigns the value of `cards[i - 1]` to `num_cards`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `num_cards` will be assigned `cards[2]`.

- `i` remains 3.
- `n` is still greater than 2.
- `num_cards` is updated to `cards[2]`.
- `remaining_coins` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- `score` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- `remaining_cards` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- `max_score` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is updated by adding `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to its current value, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`, and `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
