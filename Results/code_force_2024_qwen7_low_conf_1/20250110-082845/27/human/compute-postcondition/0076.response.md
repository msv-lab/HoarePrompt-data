`min_` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. This means that the current minimum value in the array `a` up to index `i` is now stored in `min_`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. However, the precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` is `a[i]`**
