`min_` is incremented by `k // i`. The value of `i` is `n`, so `k // i` is `k // n`. The value of `trg` remains unchanged because no operation affects it. The value of `n` remains greater than 1 because no operation changes its value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`; `min_` is increased by `k // n`**
