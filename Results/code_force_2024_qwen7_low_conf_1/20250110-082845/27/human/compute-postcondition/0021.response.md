The code `max_score = max(max_score, score)` updates `max_score` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `score`. Since the exact value of `score` is not specified, it is based on the function `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`. However, we know the following:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `num_cards` is `cards[1]`.
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`.
- `score` is updated by adding `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to its current value.
- `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`.

Since `score` is calculated using `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, and `max_score` is updated to be the maximum of `max_score` and `score`, the value of `max_score` will be updated to the higher of its current value and the new value of `score`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is updated by adding `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to its current value, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`, `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
