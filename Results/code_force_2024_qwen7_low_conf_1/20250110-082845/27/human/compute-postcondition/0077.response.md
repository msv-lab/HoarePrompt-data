The code `min_idx = i` assigns the value of the variable `i` to `min_idx`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value for `min_idx` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` is `a[i]`, `min_idx` is `i**
