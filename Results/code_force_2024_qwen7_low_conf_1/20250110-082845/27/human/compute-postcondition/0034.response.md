To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the possible outcomes based on the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop runs for `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `num_cards > 0` and if `remaining_coins >= 0`.

2. **Variable Updates**:
   - `num_cards` is the number of cards of the current type (`cards[i - 1]`).
   - `remaining_coins` is calculated as `coins - (n - num_cards)`.
   - `score` is updated based on the condition `remaining_coins >= 0`. If true, `score` is set to `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`. Otherwise, `score` retains its previous value.
   - `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i` plus `remaining_coins` if `remaining_coins >= 0`.

3. **Max Score Update**:
   - `max_score` is updated to the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score` if `remaining_coins >= 0`. Otherwise, `max_score` retains its previous value.

### Final State After All Iterations:

- **Case 1: Loop Executes All `n` Times**:
  - The loop will execute for all values of `i` from 1 to `n`.
  - The final `max_score` will be the maximum score achieved across all iterations where `remaining_coins >= 0`.

- **Case 2: Loop Does Not Execute**:
  - This would happen if `n` is 0, meaning the list `cards` is empty.
  - In this case, `max_score` remains 0.

### Output State:

Considering the above analysis, the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations (or none at all if `n` is 0) is:

Output State: **`max_score` is the maximum score achieved when `remaining_coins >= 0` across all iterations, `i` is the last iteration number that satisfied the condition, `n` is the length of the list `cards`, `remaining_coins` is the remaining coins after the last valid iteration (if any), and `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding the types of cards that were bought (if any).**
