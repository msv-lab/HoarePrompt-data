Output State: **`outs` is a list of length `t` containing the values of `tot` for each test case, `t` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `min_` is 0, `min_idx` is 0.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop, `outs` will contain the result `tot` for each test case.
- If there are no test cases (`t` is 0), then `outs` will be an empty list.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `min_`, and `min_idx` will be reset to their initial values (0) because they are not preserved across different test cases.
- The loop runs for each test case, and after processing all test cases, `t` will be reduced to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.

Since the loop processes each test case independently, and `t` is a count of the number of test cases, once `t` reaches 0, it signifies that all test cases have been processed. At this point, all other variables related to the current test case will revert to their initial values.
