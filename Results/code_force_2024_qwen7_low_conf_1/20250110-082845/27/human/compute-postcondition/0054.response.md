The value of `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`, and `k` is decreased by this value. Since `k` was initially greater than or equal to `trg`, after subtracting `trg` from `k`, `k` will still be greater than or equal to 0 but less than its original value.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - trg`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a`, `min_idx` is 0, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`**
