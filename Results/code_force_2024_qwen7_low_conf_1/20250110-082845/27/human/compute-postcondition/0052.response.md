The code assigns the value of `trg` as `i * (a[i] - min_)`. Here, `i` is not defined in the initial state, so let's assume `i` is an index within the range of the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `a[i]` refers to the `i`-th element of the list. `min_` is the minimum value in `a`, which is `a[0]` since `min_idx` is 0.

Let's denote the elements of the list `a` as `a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]`, where `a[0]` is the smallest element due to the list being sorted in ascending order.

Given this, the value of `trg` can be expressed as:
\[ trg = i \times (a[i] - a[0]) \]

Since `i` is not specified, let's leave it as `i` in the final output state.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a`, `min_idx` is 0, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`**
