The code updates the variable `tot` based on the formula `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_`, `min_idx`, `i`, `a`, and `trg`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the formula:
- `min_` is the original `min_` plus `k // n` if `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1` and `k` is greater than 0.
- `min_` remains unchanged otherwise.

Let's calculate `tot` using the given formula:
1. Calculate `(min_ - 1) * (n - 1)` which is the product of `(min_ - 1)` and `(n - 1)`.
2. Add `(n - 1 - min_idx)` which is the difference between `(n - 1)` and `min_idx`.
3. Add `k`.

Since the exact values of `min_`, `n`, `k`, and `min_idx` are not specified, we will keep them in their symbolic form.

Therefore, the updated value of `tot` is:
\[ tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `min_` is the original `min_` plus `k // n` if `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1` and `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `min_` remains unchanged; `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value; `i` is `n`; `a` is the sorted list; `trg` is `0`; `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`.**
