You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `num_cards` is `cards[0]`
   - `remaining_coins` is non-negative
   - `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
   - `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i` and includes `remaining_coins`
   - `max_score` is `score`

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and we need `i` to be less than `n + 1` for the next iteration, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop.
   - `num_cards` is derived from `cards[0]` and does not change with `i`.
   - `remaining_coins` remains non-negative.
   - `score` is calculated based on the current `i` and `remaining_cards`, so it needs to be recalculated with `i` set to 2.
   - `remaining_cards` will be updated to exclude `i = 2` and include `remaining_coins`.
   - `max_score` is the current score, which will be updated if the new score in the next iteration is higher.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` is still greater than 0.
   - `num_cards` is still `cards[0]`.
   - `remaining_coins` is still non-negative.
   - `score` is recalculated as `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
   - `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`.
   - `max_score` will be updated if the new score is higher.

**State:**
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `num_cards` is `cards[0]`
- `remaining_coins` is non-negative
- `score` is `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
- `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`
- `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`
```
num_cards = cards[i - 1]

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
