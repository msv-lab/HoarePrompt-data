`k` is decremented by the value of `trg`, which is `i * (a[i] - min_)`. The values of `i`, `a[i]`, and `min_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `i` is its original value, `a[i]` is its original value, `min_` is its original value, and `k` is decreased by `trg`.

Output State: **`trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `i` is its original value, `a[i]` is its original value, `min_` is its original value, and `k` is decreased by `trg`.**
