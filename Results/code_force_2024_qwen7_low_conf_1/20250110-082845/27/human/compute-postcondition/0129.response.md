`min_` is incremented by `k // n`. Given the initial conditions, `k` is less than `n * (a[n] - min_)` and `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, `k // n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `k`.

The updated value of `min_` will be the original `min_` plus `k // n`. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `min_`, but we know it has been incremented by `k // n`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n`, `k` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n * (a[n] - min_)` and is less than `n * (a[n] - min_)`, `min_` is the original `min_` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value, `i` is `n`, `a` is the sorted list, `trg` is `0`, `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1`, and `k` is greater than `0`**
