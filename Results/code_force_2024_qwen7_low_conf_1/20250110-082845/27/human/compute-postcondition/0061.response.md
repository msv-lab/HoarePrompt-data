The code `break` does not change any variable values but indicates that the most internal loop or conditional block is broken out of. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k % i`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k_value // 1`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])` and `(k < trg)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
