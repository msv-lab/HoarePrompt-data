The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `min_`. This means that `min_` will now hold the value of `a[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, as does `a[i]`. The variable `k` is decreased by `trg`, which was originally defined as `i * (a[i] - min_)`. Since `min_` is now equal to `a[i]`, `trg` is effectively zero because `(a[i] - min_)` becomes zero.

Therefore, `k` is decreased by 0, meaning `k` remains unchanged from its original value.

Output State: **`trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[i])` which is 0, `i` is its original value, `a[i]` is its original value, `min_` is `a[i]`, and `k` is its original value.**
