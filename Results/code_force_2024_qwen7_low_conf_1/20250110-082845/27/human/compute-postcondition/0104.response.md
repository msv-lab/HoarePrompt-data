The code `k = k % i` calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i` and assigns the result back to `k`. The values of `n`, `trg`, `min_`, `min_idx`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `k` is less than `trg`, and the operation `k = k % i` does not affect this condition since `k` is already less than `trg` and the modulo operation will keep `k` within a range less than `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`; `min_` is updated by adding `k // i`; the value of `k` is now `k % i`; `min_idx` is `i - 1`.**
