Postcondition: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the same as the initial value, `outs` is an empty list, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`. The first element of `a` is the minimum value in `a`, `k` is greater than 0, and `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1`**
