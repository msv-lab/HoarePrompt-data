`min_idx` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n`, so `min_idx` is now `n`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`; `k` is `k - trg`; `min_` is `a[n]`; `min_idx` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`; `k` is `k - trg`; `min_` is `a[n]`; `min_idx` is `n`**
