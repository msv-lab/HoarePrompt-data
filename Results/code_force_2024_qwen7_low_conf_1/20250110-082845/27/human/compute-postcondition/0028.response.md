The code updates `remaining_cards` by creating a new list that excludes the element `i` from `cards`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 3
- `n` is greater than 2
- `num_cards` is `cards[2]`
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`
- `score` is `cards[2] * n`
- `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`
- `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`

After executing the line `remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]`, the `remaining_cards` list will no longer include the element `3`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is `cards[2] * n`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 3 plus `remaining_coins`, and `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
