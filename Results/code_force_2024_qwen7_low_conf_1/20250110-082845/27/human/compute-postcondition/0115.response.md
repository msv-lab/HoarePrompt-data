The code `break` does not modify any variables but breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since no such structure is present in the given code snippet, the effect is simply to exit the context where this statement would be valid.

Given the initial state and the fact that no variables are modified or recalculated within the scope of the `break` statement, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`; `min_` is increased by `k // n`; `min_idx` is `n - 1`; `k` is `k % i`.**
