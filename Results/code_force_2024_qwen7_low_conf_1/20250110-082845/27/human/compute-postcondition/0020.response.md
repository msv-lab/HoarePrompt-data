`score` is incremented by the value returned by `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`. Since `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`, and `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, the exact value of `remaining_cards` and `remaining_coins` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `cards`, `num_cards`, `coins`, and `n`. However, we know that `score` is updated based on the function call.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is updated by adding `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to its current value, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`, `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
