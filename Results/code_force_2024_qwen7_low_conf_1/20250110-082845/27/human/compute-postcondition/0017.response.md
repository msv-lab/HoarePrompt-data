Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `num_cards` is `cards[1]`
   - `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`
   - `score` is `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
   - `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`
   - `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   score = num_cards * n
   ```

3. Analyzing the impact of this code:
   - The variable `score` was previously defined as `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
   - Now, `score` is updated to `num_cards * n`.

4. Since `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, we can substitute it in the new equation:
   - `score` is now `cards[1] * n`.

5. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `remaining_coins`, `remaining_cards`, `max_score`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so they remain in their original states.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is `cards[1] * n`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`, `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
