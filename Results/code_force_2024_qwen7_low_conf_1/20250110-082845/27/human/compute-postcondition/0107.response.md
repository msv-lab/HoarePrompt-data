According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. The loop needs to check if `i` is less than `n` to determine if it can execute again.

Given that the loop has just completed its previous iteration, we know the following:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is currently at its maximum value from the previous iteration, which is `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and checked against `n`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `n`.

At this point, `i` is `n`, and since the loop condition is `i < n`, the loop will not execute again because `n` is not less than `n`.

Therefore, no further adjustments to the states are needed as the loop will not proceed to another iteration based on the given condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`**
