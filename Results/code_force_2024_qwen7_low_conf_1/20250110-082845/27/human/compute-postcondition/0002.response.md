Let's break down the given code and determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Given Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial States:
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers representing the number of cards of each type.
- `coins` is an integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards.
- `n` is the length of the list `cards`.
- `max_score` is 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1 - 1`, which means `i` will take values from `1` to `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be at least `1` and no more than `n`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop relies on the value of `n` to determine its termination condition (`range(1, n + 1)`).
   - `n` must be at least `1` to ensure the loop runs at least once.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `cards`, `coins`, and `max_score` are not directly involved in the loop's execution conditions but may be modified inside the loop. We don't need to adjust their initial states for the loop to run.

### Required Adjustments:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to guarantee that `i` starts at `1` and `n` is at least `1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
