`remaining_cards.append(remaining_coins)` appends the value of `remaining_coins` to the list `remaining_cards`. According to the initial state, `remaining_coins` is calculated as `coins - (n - cards[0])`.

Therefore, after the execution of this line of code, the value of `remaining_cards` will be updated to include the new element `remaining_coins`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - cards[0])`, `score` is `cards[0] * n`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i` and includes `remaining_coins`.**
