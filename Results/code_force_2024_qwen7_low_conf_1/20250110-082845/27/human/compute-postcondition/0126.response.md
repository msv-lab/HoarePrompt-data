Postcondition: ***`trg` is 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is its original value, `min_` is its original value, `k` is its original value, `min_idx` is 0 if `k >= trg`. Otherwise, `i` is its original value, `a[i]` is its original value, `min_` is its original value + `k // i`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - (min_ + k // i))`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, and `k` is `k % i`.***
