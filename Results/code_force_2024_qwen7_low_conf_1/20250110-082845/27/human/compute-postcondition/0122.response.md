The code updates the value of `min_` by adding `k // i` to it. The value of `trg` is dependent on `i`, `a[i]`, and `min_`. Since `min_` is updated, `trg` will also be affected.

The initial state is:
- `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`
- `i` is its original value
- `a[i]` is its original value
- `min_` is its original value

After executing `min_ += k // i`, the new value of `min_` will be the original value of `min_` plus `k // i`.

The value of `trg` will be updated as follows:
\[ \text{new\_trg} = i \times (a[i] - (\text{original\_min\_} + k // i)) \]

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is its original value
- `a[i]` is its original value
- `min_` is its original value plus `k // i`
- `trg` is `i * (a[i] - (min_ + k // i))`

Output State: **`i` is its original value; `a[i]` is its original value; `min_` is its original value + `k // i`; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - (min_ + k // i))`**
