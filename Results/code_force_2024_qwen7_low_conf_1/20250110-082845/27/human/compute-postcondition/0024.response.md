Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( i \) is 2
- \( n \) is greater than 0
- \( num\_cards \) is \( cards[1] \)
- \( remaining\_coins \) is \( coins - (n - num\_cards) \)
- \( score \) is updated by adding \( func\_1(remaining\_cards, remaining\_coins) \) to its current value
- \( remaining\_cards \) is a list of elements from \( cards \) excluding 2 plus \( remaining\_coins \)
- \( max\_score \) is the maximum of the current \( max\_score \) and the new \( score \)

### Loop Condition:
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Value of \( i \)**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) is 2.

2. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if \( i < n + 1 \).

3. **Incrementing \( i \)**:
   - Since the loop increments \( i \) by 1 each iteration, \( i \) will become 3 in the next iteration.

4. **Updating Other Variables**:
   - The loop body updates several variables:
     - \( num\_cards \): It remains \( cards[1] \).
     - \( remaining\_coins \): It remains \( coins - (n - num\_cards) \).
     - \( remaining\_cards \): It remains a list of elements from \( cards \) excluding 2 plus \( remaining\_coins \).
     - \( score \): It is updated by adding \( func\_1(remaining\_cards, remaining\_coins) \) to its current value.
     - \( max\_score \): It is updated to be the maximum of the current \( max\_score \) and the new \( score \).

5. **Loop Continuation**:
   - For the next iteration to occur, \( i \) must be less than \( n + 1 \). Given that \( i \) becomes 3, the condition \( i < n + 1 \) depends on \( n \) being greater than 2.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- \( i \) will be 3.
- \( n \) must still be greater than 0.
- \( num\_cards \) remains \( cards[1] \).
- \( remaining\_coins \) remains \( coins - (n - num\_cards) \).
- \( remaining\_cards \) remains a list of elements from \( cards \) excluding 2 plus \( remaining\_coins \).
- \( score \) will be updated by adding \( func\_1(remaining\_cards, remaining\_coins) \) to its current value.
- \( max\_score \) will be updated to be the maximum of the current \( max\_score \) and the new \( score \).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is updated by adding `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to its current value, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`, and `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
