The code `print(out)` does not affect any variables; it only prints the value of `out`. Since `outs` is a non-empty list and `t` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The output of the print statement is the value of `out`, but this value is not stored in any variable, so it does not alter the state of `outs` or `t`.

Output State: **`outs` is a non-empty list, `t` must be greater than 0, print statement outputs the value of `out`**
