`min_idx` is assigned the value `i - 1`. The value of `i` is used directly in the calculation, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `min_idx` and keeps the values of the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `n` must be greater than 1, `min_` is `prev_min + k // i`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`**
