The code appends `remaining_coins` to the list `remaining_cards`. The value of `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`. Since `remaining_cards` was previously a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2, appending `remaining_coins` to it changes its contents. However, the values of `i`, `n`, `num_cards`, `score`, and `max_score` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is `cards[1] * n`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`, `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
