Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the same as the initial value, `outs` is an empty list, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`. If `min_idx` equals `n - 1` and `k > 0`, then `k` is updated to `k % n`. Otherwise, the values of `min_` and `min_idx` remain unchanged.***
