Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `trg`, `trg` remains as `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` remains as `a[i]`, and `min_idx` is `i`. Otherwise, `trg` remains unchanged, `min_` is updated by adding `k // i`, `k` is updated to `k % i`, and `min_idx` is set to `i - 1` with the most internal loop or block broken out.**
