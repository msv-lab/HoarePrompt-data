The `score` variable is incremented by the result of the function call `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `num_cards`, `remaining_coins`, and `remaining_cards` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the updated `score` will be the original `score` plus the value returned by `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - cards[0])`, `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i` and includes `remaining_coins`**
