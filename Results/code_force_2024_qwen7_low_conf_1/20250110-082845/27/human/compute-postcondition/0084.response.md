Postcondition: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the value of the first input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted by the final value of `k // i` when the loop ends, `min_idx` is the index of the new `min_` in the list `a`, and `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1`.**
