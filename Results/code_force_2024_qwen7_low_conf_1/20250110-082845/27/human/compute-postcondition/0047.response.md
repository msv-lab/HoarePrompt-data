The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n` and `k` are now assigned specific integer values based on user input, but since we don't know the actual input, we'll keep `n` and `k` as placeholders for their respective values. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the value of the first input integer, `k` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`**
