Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `outs` is `[tot, tot]`
   - `t` is `t - 2`
   - `n` is the value of the first integer input
   - `k` is the value of the second integer input
   - `a` is the sorted version of the original list `a`
   - `min_` is `a[0]`
   - `min_idx` is `0`
   - `tot` is calculated as `min_a + 2 * (k // n) + (min_a + 2 * (k // n) - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1) + k`

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning the loop will execute if `n > 1`.

3. **Required Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `1`.
   - The initial values of the loop variable `i` and the condition checking for each iteration will start with `i = 1` and continue until `i < n`.

4. **Summary of States to Adjust:**
   - We need to ensure `n` is greater than `1` for the loop to start executing.
   - The other variables (`outs`, `t`, `k`, `a`, `min_`, `min_idx`, and `tot`) are not directly related to the loop's execution but are part of the overall program state.

Therefore, the required state adjustments are:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
