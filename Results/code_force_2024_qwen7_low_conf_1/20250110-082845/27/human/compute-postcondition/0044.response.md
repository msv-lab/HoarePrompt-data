The code calculates `tot` using the formula `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`.
- `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`.
- If `min_idx` equals `n - 1` and `k > 0`, then `k` is updated to `k % n`.

Since the exact values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `min_`, and `min_idx` are not given, let's consider a general case:

1. Calculate `min_`: `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`.
2. Calculate `tot`: `tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `outs`, `a`, `min_`, and `min_idx`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the same as the initial value, `outs` is an empty list, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`. If `min_idx` equals `n - 1` and `k > 0`, then `k` is updated to `k % n`. Otherwise, the values of `min_` and `min_idx` remain unchanged.**
