`min_idx` is assigned the value `i - 1`. The value of `i` is initially equal to `n`, so `min_idx` becomes `n - 1`. The other variables (`trg`, `min_`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`; `min_` is increased by `k // n`; `min_idx` is `n - 1`**
