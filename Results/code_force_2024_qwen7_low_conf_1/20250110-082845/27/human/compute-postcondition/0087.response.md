Postcondition: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the value of the first input integer, `k` is `k % n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted by the final value of `k // n` plus `k // n`, and `min_idx` is the index of the new `min_` in the list `a`. If `min_idx` equals `n - 1` and `k` is greater than 0, then `k` is updated to `k % n`.**
