The code `max_score = max(max_score, score)` updates `max_score` to be the maximum of its current value and `score`. Since `score` is defined as `cards[2] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, the value of `max_score` will be updated to this new value of `score` if `score` is greater than the current `max_score`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is greater than 2
- `num_cards` is `cards[2]`
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`
- `score` is `cards[2] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
- `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 3 plus `remaining_coins` appended
- `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`

After the line `max_score = max(max_score, score)` is executed, `max_score` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `score`.

Since the exact values of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` and the current `max_score` are not specified, we represent the updated `max_score` as the maximum of the current `max_score` and `score`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is `cards[2] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 3 plus `remaining_coins` appended, and `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and `score`.**
