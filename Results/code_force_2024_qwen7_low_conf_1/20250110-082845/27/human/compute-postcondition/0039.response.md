To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step by step.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `n-1`. In each iteration, it updates the `min_` and `min_idx` based on the condition whether `k` is greater than or equal to `trg`.

### Key Observations
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `k` is an integer that is adjusted during the loop.
   - `outs` is initially an empty list.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `min_` is the minimum value in `a` and is initialized to `a[0]`.
   - `min_idx` is the index of `min_` and is initialized to `0`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the loop calculates `trg = i * (a[i] - min_)`.
   - If `k >= trg`, then `k` is reduced by `trg`, `min_` is updated to `a[i]`, and `min_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - If `k < trg`, then `k` is reduced to the remainder of `k` divided by `i`, `min_` is incremented by `k // i`, and `min_idx` is updated to `i - 1`. The loop breaks.

### Final State After All Iterations
After the loop finishes executing, we need to consider the following:
- The loop ensures that `k` is always non-negative and eventually becomes zero or a small value.
- `min_` and `min_idx` will reflect the final values after the loop has run through all iterations.
- The final value of `k` will be zero because the loop reduces `k` until it is no longer possible to satisfy the condition `k >= trg`.

### Output State
- `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- `outs` remains an empty list since the problem statement does not indicate any operations on `outs` inside the loop.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order.
- `min_` is the smallest value in `a` after the loop has executed.
- `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`.
- `k` is zero because the loop ensures that `k` is reduced to zero or a very small value.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the same as the initial value, `outs` is an empty list, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`, `k` is 0.**
