The code updates `max_score` to be the maximum of `max_score` and `score`. Since `max_score` was not previously defined, it will take the initial value of `score` if no other value has been assigned to it before this line. The variables `i`, `n`, `num_cards`, `remaining_coins`, `score`, `remaining_cards`, and `func_1` remain unchanged.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - cards[0])`, `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i` and includes `remaining_coins`, `max_score` is `score`**
