The list comprehension `remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]` creates a new list that includes only the elements from `cards` that are not equal to `i`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `num_cards`, `remaining_coins`, and `score`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - cards[0])`, `score` is `cards[0] * n`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i`.**
