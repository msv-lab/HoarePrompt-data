The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `min_`. This means the current value of `a[i]` is stored in `min_`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - (i * (a[i] - min_))`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[i]`, `min_idx` is either `i` or `i - 1` depending on the if condition, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`.**
