`remaining_coins` is assigned the value `coins - (n - num_cards)`. Given that `num_cards` is equal to `cards[0]`, the expression simplifies to `remaining_coins = coins - (n - cards[0])`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `num_cards` is greater than 0 are still valid.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - cards[0])`**
