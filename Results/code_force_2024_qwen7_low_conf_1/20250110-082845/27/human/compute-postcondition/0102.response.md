`min_` is incremented by `k // i`. The value of `k` is less than `trg`, which is `i * (a[i] - min_)`. However, the exact values of `a[i]`, `k`, and `min_` are not specified. Therefore, we only know that `min_` is updated, and the other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`; `min_` is updated by adding `k // i`; the value of `k` is less than `trg`.**
