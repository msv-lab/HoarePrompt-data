The code snippet appends the value of `tot` to the list `outs`. Since `tot` is defined as `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`, this value is added to the list `outs`. However, none of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `min_`, `min_idx`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the same as the initial value, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`. If `min_idx` equals `n - 1` and `k > 0`, then `k` is updated to `k % n`. Otherwise, the values of `min_` and `min_idx` remain unchanged.**
