The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The variables `outs`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `min_`, and `min_idx` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, we need to update the value of `a` to reflect the new input.

Let's denote the input line as `input_str`, which is a string containing space-separated integers. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", then `input_str` would be "1 2 3". After splitting and converting, `a` would be `[1, 2, 3]`.

Since the exact input is not specified, we'll represent the updated `a` as a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer is read from the input. We also know that `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`, and `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the value of the first input integer, `k` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order (read from the input), `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`**
