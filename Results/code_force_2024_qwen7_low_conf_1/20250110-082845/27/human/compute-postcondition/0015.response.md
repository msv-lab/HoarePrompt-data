The code `num_cards = cards[i - 1]` updates `num_cards` to be the value of `cards[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is currently 2. Therefore, `num_cards` will be updated to `cards[1]`.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `num_cards` is updated to `cards[1]`.
- `remaining_coins` remains non-negative.
- `score` is calculated as `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
- `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`.
- `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `remaining_coins` is non-negative, `score` is `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`, `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
