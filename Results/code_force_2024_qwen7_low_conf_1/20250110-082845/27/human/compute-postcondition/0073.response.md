To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- **`outs`**: A list containing `tot`.
- **`t`**: Decreased by 1 (`t = t - 1`).
- **`n`**: Greater than 1 (`n > 1`).
- **`k`**: Updated based on an if condition inside the loop.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the highest value it could be without exceeding `n`.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `outs` contains `[tot]`.
   - `t = t - 1` (decreased by 1).
   - `n > 1`.
   - `k` is updated based on the if condition. If `k >= trg`, then `k` is set to `k - (i * (a[i] - min_))` and `min_` is set to `a[i]` with `min_idx` being `i`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k % i` and `min_` is adjusted to the minimum value in `a` plus `k // i` with `min_idx` being `i - 1`.

2. **For the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - `i` needs to increment by 1, so `i` will be `n - 1` (the highest value it could be without exceeding `n`).
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `k` is updated based on the if condition, but the exact value of `k` will depend on the condition and the values of `i` and `a[i]`.

Since `i` is currently `n-1` and the loop needs to continue, `i` will become `n` in the next iteration. However, `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue. 

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `n`.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is updated based on the if condition (depending on the specific logic inside the loop).**

This means:
- `i` is now `n`.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `t` remains `t - 1`.
- `k` is updated based on the if condition from the previous iteration, which will influence the next update.

So, the final state is:
State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is updated based on the if condition.**
