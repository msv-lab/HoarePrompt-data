Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `outs` is an empty list, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[3]` or updated to `min_ + k // 3`, `min_idx` is either 3 or 2, `i` is 3, `k` is either `k % 3` or `k - 3 * (a[3] - min_)`, and `trg` is `3 * (a[3] - min_)` after the if-else block executes.***

This postcondition covers both cases of the if and else parts, ensuring that all relevant variables are described in their final states after the if-else block is executed.
