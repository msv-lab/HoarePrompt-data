The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. 

Given the initial state:
- `outs` is `[tot, tot]`
- `t` is `t - 2`
- `n` is the value of the first integer input
- `k` is the value of the second integer input
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order
- `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted by the final value of `k // n` plus `k // n`
- `min_idx` is the index of the new `min_` in the list `a`
- `tot` is calculated as `min_a + 2 \times (k // n) + (min_a + 2 \times (k // n) - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1) + k`

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` is updated to a new list of integers read from input.
- The other variables (`outs`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `min_`, `min_idx`, and `tot`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`outs` is `[tot, tot]`, `t` is `t - 2`, `n` is the value of the first integer input, `k` is the value of the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted by the final value of `k // n` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of the new `min_` in the list `a`, `tot` is calculated as `min_a + 2 \times (k // n) + (min_a + 2 \times (k // n) - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1) + k**
