The initial state is as follows:
- `outs` is `[tot]`
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the value of the first input integer
- `k` is the value of the second input integer
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order
- `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`
- `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`

The code snippet sets `min_` to `a[0]` (the first element of the list `a`) and `min_idx` to `0` (the index of the first element).

Since `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `a[0]` is the minimum value in the list. Therefore, `min_` is set to the minimum value of the list `a`. Also, `min_idx` is set to `0` because the minimum value is at index `0`.

The Output State is:
**`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the value of the first input integer, `k` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a`, `min_idx` is 0**
