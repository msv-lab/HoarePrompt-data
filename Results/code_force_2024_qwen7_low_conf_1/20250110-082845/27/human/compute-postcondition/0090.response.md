Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `outs` is `[tot, tot]`
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `n` is the value of the first input integer
   - `k` is `k % n`
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order
   - `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted by the final value of `k // n` plus `k // n`
   - `min_idx` is the index of the new `min_` in the list `a`
   - `tot` is calculated as `min_a + 2 \times (k // n) + (min_a + 2 \times (k // n) - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1) + k`

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop variable `tt` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop runs `t` times.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (`t = t - 1`), the loop will continue as long as `t > 0`.
   - We need to check the value of `t` to determine if the loop should run again.

4. **Loop Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was `t - 1`, meaning it was non-zero.
   - For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.

5. **Final State After Adjustment:**
   - `t` will be `t - 1` minus 1, so `t` becomes `t - 2`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged because the loop body does not modify them directly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`outs` is `[tot, tot]`, `t` is `t - 2`, `n` is the value of the first input integer, `k` is `k % n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted by the final value of `k // n` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of the new `min_` in the list `a`, and `tot` is calculated as `min_a + 2 \times (k // n) + (min_a + 2 \times (k // n) - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1) + k`.**
