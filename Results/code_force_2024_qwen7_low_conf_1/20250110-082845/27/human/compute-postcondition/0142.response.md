The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it processes input data that includes a series of test cases, where each test case contains an integer `t` (the number of test cases), followed by `t` sets of integers. Each set includes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function's behavior is defined by the given constraints and relationships between the inputs.

For each test case:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\).
- For each test case, a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is provided where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^{12}\).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

Based on the provided information, the function returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the return value is not detailed in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of integers. Each set includes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
