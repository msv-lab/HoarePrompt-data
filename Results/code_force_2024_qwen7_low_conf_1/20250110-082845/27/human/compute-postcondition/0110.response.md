`min_` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, `min_` is updated to the value of `a[n]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`; `k` is `k - trg`; `min_` is `a[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`; `k` is `k - trg`; `min_` is `a[n]`**
