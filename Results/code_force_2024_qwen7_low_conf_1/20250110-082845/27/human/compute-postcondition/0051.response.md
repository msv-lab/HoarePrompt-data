To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `outs` is `[tot]`
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the value of the first input integer
- `k` is the value of the second input integer
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order
- `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`
- `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` should be `1` or greater but less than `n`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is the number of elements in the list `a` and also the upper limit for the loop.
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **List `a`:**
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order.
   - This remains unchanged throughout the loop.

4. **Variables `min_` and `min_idx`:**
   - These are already set to the minimum value in `a` and its index respectively.
   - These do not change within the loop.

5. **Variables `outs`, `t`, `k`:**
   - These variables are not modified by the loop and remain as they are.

### Required Adjustments:
- Ensure that `i` is `1` or greater.
- Ensure that `n` is greater than `1`.

### Updated State:
State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a`, `min_idx` is 0**

This ensures that the loop can execute as intended.
