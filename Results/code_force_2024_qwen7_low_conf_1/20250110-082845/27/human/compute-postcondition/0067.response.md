The code sets `min_idx` to `i`. This means that the value of `min_idx` changes from being either `i` or `i - 1` depending on the if condition to simply `i`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - (i * (a[i] - min_))`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[i]`, `min_idx` is `i`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`.**
