To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Initial State:
- `outs` is `[tot, tot]`
- `t` is `t - 2`
- `n` is the value of the first integer input
- `k` is the value of the second integer input
- `a` is the sorted version of the original list `a`
- `min_` is `a[0]`
- `min_idx` is `0`
- `tot` is calculated as `min_a + 2 * (k // n) + (min_a + 2 * (k // n) - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1) + k`

#### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    trg = i * (a[i] - min_)
    if k >= trg:
        k -= trg
        min_ = a[i]
        min_idx = i
    else:
        min_ += k // i
        min_idx = i - 1
        k = k % i
        break
```

#### Observations from Provided Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - If `k >= trg`, then `trg` remains as `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` remains as `a[i]`, and `min_idx` is `i`.
   - Otherwise, `trg` remains unchanged, `min_` is updated by adding `k // i`, `k` is updated to `k % i`, and `min_idx` is set to `i - 1` with the most internal loop or block broken out.

2. **After 2 iterations:**
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is `n`
   - `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`
   - If `k >= trg`, then `k` is updated to `k - trg`, `min_` is set to `a[n]`, and `min_idx` is set to `n`.
   - Otherwise, `min_` is increased by `k // n`, and `min_idx` is set to `n - 1`, with `k` being updated to `k % n`.

3. **After 3 iterations:**
   - `trg` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `a[i]` is its original value
   - `min_` is its original value
   - `k` is its original value
   - `min_idx` is 0 if `k >= trg`
   - Otherwise, `i` is its original value, `a[i]` is its original value, `min_` is its original value + `k // i`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - (min_ + k // i))`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, and `k` is `k % i`.

#### Conclusion:
From the provided output states, we can infer that the loop will continue until `k` is less than `trg` for all possible `i` from `1` to `n-1`. When the loop exits, `k` will be less than `trg` for all `i` from `1` to `n-1`.

- `n` will be the original value of `n`.
- `k` will be the remainder when divided by the last `trg` (which is `n * (a[n] - min_)`), so `k` will be less than `n * (a[n] - min_)`.
- `min_` will be the minimum value encountered during the loop, and `min_idx` will be the index of this minimum value.
- `i` will be `n` (the last value of `i`).

Since the loop exits when `k` is less than `trg` for all `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the final state of the variables will be as follows:

#### Output State:
**Output State: `n` is the original value of `n`, `k` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n * (a[n] - min_)` and is less than `n * (a[n] - min_)`, `min_` is the minimum value encountered during the loop, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value, `i` is `n`, `a` is the sorted list, and `trg` is `0`.**

This is because once the loop exits, `k` cannot be further reduced by any `trg`, meaning `k` is now the remainder of the division and `trg` is `0`.
