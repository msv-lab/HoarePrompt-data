The code `min_ += k // i` updates the value of `min_` by adding the integer division of `k` by `i` to it. However, the specific values of `k` and `i` are not provided in the initial state, so we can only express `min_` in terms of its previous value and the division.

Let's denote the previous value of `min_` as `prev_min`. Therefore, the new value of `min_` is `prev_min + k // i`.

Other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `n` must be greater than 1, `min_` is `prev_min + k // i`**
