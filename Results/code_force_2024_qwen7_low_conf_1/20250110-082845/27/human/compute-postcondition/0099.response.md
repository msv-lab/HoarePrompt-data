The code sets `min_` to the value of `a[i]`. This means that the minimum value between `min_` and `a[i]` is now `a[i]`. The other variables (`n`, `trg`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `k` is greater than or equal to `trg - trg`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` is `a[i]`**
