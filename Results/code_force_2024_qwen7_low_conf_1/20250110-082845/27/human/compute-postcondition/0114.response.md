`k` is assigned the value of `k % i`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is updated to its remainder when divided by `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`; `min_` is increased by `k // n`; `min_idx` is `n - 1`; `k` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`; `min_` is increased by `k // n`; `min_idx` is `n - 1`; `k` is `k % i`**
