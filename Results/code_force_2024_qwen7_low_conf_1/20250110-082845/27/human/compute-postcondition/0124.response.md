The code `k = k % i` changes the value of `k` to be the remainder when `k` is divided by `i`. The other variables (`a[i]`, `min_`, `trg`, and `min_idx`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is its original value; `a[i]` is its original value; `min_` is its original value + `k // i`; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - (min_ + k // i))`; `min_idx` is `i - 1`; `k` is `k % i`.

Output State: **`i` is its original value; `a[i]` is its original value; `min_` is its original value + `k // i`; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - (min_ + k // i))`; `min_idx` is `i - 1`; `k` is `k % i`.**
