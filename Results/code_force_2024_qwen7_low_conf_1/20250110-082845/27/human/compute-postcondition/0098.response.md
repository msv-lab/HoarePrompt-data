`k` is assigned the value of `k - trg`. Given the initial state, `trg` is defined as `i * (a[i] - min_)`, so `k` is decreased by this value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `k` is greater than or equal to `trg - trg`, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`**.
