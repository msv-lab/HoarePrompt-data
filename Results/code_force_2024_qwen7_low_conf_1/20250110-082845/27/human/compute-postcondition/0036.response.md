The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cards`, which is a list of `n` integers representing the number of cards of each type, and `coins`, which is an integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards. The constraints are that each type of card is numbered from 1 to `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5`, and `0 ≤ coins ≤ 10^{12}`.

The function calculates the maximum score achievable by purchasing additional cards with the available coins, ensuring that the remaining coins after each purchase are non-negative.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `cards` and an integer `coins`, and return the maximum score (`max_score`) achievable under the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `cards` and an integer `coins`, and returns the maximum score (`max_score`) achievable.**
