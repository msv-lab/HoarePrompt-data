`min_idx` is assigned the value `i - 1`. This changes the value of `min_idx` from its previous state which could have been `i` or `i - 1` depending on the if condition. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is adjusted according to the if condition, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // i` adjusted based on the if condition, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`.**
