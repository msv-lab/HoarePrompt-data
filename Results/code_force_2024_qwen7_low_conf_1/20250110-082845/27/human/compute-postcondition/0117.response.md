Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`.
   - If `k >= trg`, then:
     - `k` is updated to `k - trg`.
     - `min_` is set to `a[n]`.
     - `min_idx` is set to `n`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `min_` is increased by `k // n`.
     - `min_idx` is set to `n - 1`.
     - `k` is updated to `k % n`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should be within the range of `1` to `n-1`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is `n` now, it cannot be incremented further without changing the value of `n`. Therefore, `n` must be decreased by 1 to allow the next iteration where `i` starts from 1.

### Final State:

- `n` must be `n - 1` to allow the loop to iterate one more time starting from `i = 1`.

**State:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 1 and equal to `n - 1`, `i` is 1, `trg` is `(n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - min_)`**
