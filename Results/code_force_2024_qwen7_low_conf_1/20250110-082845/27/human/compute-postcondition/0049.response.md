The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` was already mentioned to be sorted in ascending order, sorting it again does not change its values. The other variables (`outs`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `min_`, and `min_idx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the value of the first input integer, `k` is the value of the second input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`**
