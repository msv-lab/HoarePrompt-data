The code creates a new list `remaining_cards` by filtering out the element `i` (which is 2) from the original `cards` list. The original list `cards` is unchanged, but `remaining_cards` now excludes the element 2. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given that `i` is 2, the new `remaining_cards` will be a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2. Since `num_cards` was initially `cards[1]`, and `remaining_cards` now excludes `i`, `num_cards` remains unchanged as it was already excluded from the original list before this operation. The other variables (`n`, `remaining_coins`, `score`, and `max_score`) remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is `cards[1] * n`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2, `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
