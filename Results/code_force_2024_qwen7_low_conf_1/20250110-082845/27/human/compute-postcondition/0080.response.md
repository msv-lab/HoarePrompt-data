The code `k = k % i` calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i` and assigns it back to `k`. 

- `outs` is a list and does not get directly affected by this line of code.
- `t` is not directly affected.
- `trg` is not directly affected.
- `n` is not directly affected.
- `min_` is not directly affected.
- `min_idx` is not directly affected.

Therefore, the only variable that changes is `k`, which now holds the value of `k % i`.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `n` must be greater than 1, `min_` is `prev_min + k // i`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, `k` is `k % i`**
