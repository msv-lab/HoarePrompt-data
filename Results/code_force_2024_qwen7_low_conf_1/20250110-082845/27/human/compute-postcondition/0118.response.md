The given code snippet does not specify values for `i`, `a`, or `min_`. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `trg`. However, we can express `trg` in terms of `i`, `a[i]`, and `min_`.

Impact of the code:
- `trg` is assigned the value of `i * (a[i] - min_)`

Since the values of `i`, `a[i]`, and `min_` are not specified, we cannot provide a concrete value for `trg`. The only thing we know is that `trg` is computed using the formula provided.

Output State: **`trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `i` is its original value, `a[i]` is its original value, and `min_` is its original value**
