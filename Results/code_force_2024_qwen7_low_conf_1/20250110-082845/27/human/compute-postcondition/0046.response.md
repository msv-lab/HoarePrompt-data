Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `outs` is `[tot]`: This list contains the result from the previous iteration.
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100: The number of iterations remaining for the loop.
   - `n` is the same as the initial value: The size of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order: The list remains unchanged.
   - `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`: The current minimum value after adjustment.
   - `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`: The index of the minimum value.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `tt` in `range(t)`, meaning it iterates `t` times.

3. **What Needs to Change for the Next Iteration**:
   - `tt` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `t` needs to be decremented by 1 because each iteration of the loop consumes one of the remaining iterations.
   - All other variables (`outs`, `n`, `a`, `min_`, `min_idx`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but based on the information provided, they do not change between iterations.

4. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - `tt` becomes `tt + 1`.
   - `t` becomes `t - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`**.
