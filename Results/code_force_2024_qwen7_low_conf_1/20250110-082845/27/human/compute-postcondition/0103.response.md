The code `min_idx = i - 1` assigns the value of `i - 1` to the variable `min_idx`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`n`, `trg`, `min_`, `k`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`; `min_` is updated by adding `k // i`; the value of `k` is less than `trg`; `min_idx` is `i - 1`.**
