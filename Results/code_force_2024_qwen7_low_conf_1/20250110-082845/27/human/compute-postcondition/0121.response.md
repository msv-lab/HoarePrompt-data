The code assigns the value of `i` to `min_idx`. Since `i` is originally set to `a[i] - a[i]`, which is 0, `min_idx` is also assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`trg` is 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is its original value, `min_` is its original value, `k` is its original value, `min_idx` is 0**
