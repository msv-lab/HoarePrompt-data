Postcondition: ***`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `trg`, `k` is decreased by `i * (a[i] - min_)` and `min_` is set to `a[i]` with `min_idx` being `i`. Otherwise, `min_` is updated to `prev_min + k // i` with `min_idx` being `i - 1`, and `k` is set to `k % i`.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that all conditions and updates to variables are accounted for in a single, coherent statement.
