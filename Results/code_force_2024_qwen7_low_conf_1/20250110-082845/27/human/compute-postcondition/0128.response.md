Postcondition: ***`n` is the original value of `n`, `k` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n * (a[n] - min_)` and is less than `n * (a[n] - min_)`, `min_` is the minimum value encountered during the loop, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value, `i` is `n`, `a` is the sorted list, `trg` is `0`, `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1`, and `k` is greater than `0`***
