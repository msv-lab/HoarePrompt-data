Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is either `cards[2] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` if `remaining_coins >= 0`, or retains its previous value, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 3 plus `remaining_coins` appended, and `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and `score` if `remaining_coins >= 0`, or retains its previous value.**
