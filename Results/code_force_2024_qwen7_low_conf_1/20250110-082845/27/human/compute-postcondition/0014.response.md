Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `num_cards` is `cards[0]`
   - `remaining_coins` is non-negative
   - `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
   - `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i` and includes `remaining_coins`
   - `max_score` is `score`

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and we need `i` to be less than `n + 1` for the next iteration, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop.
   - `num_cards` is derived from `cards[0]` and does not change with `i`.
   - `remaining_coins` remains non-negative.
   - `score` is calculated based on the current `i` and `remaining_cards`, so it needs to be recalculated with `i` set to 2.
   - `remaining_cards` will be updated to exclude `i = 2` and include `remaining_coins`.
   - `max_score` is the current score, which will be updated if the new score in the next iteration is higher.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` is still greater than 0.
   - `num_cards` is still `cards[0]`.
   - `remaining_coins` is still non-negative.
   - `score` is recalculated as `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
   - `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`.
   - `max_score` will be updated if the new score is higher.

**State:**
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `num_cards` is `cards[0]`
- `remaining_coins` is non-negative
- `score` is `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
- `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`
- `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`
