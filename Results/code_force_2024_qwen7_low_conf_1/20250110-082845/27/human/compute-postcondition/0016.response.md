Let's break down the given code snippet and its impact on the program:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `num_cards` is `cards[1]`
   - `remaining_coins` is non-negative
   - `score` is `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
   - `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`
   - `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)
   ```

   - The value of `remaining_coins` is updated to `coins - (n - num_cards)`. 

Since `n` is greater than 0 and `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, the expression `n - num_cards` is a specific value, but we don't know the exact value of `coins`. Therefore, `remaining_coins` is now calculated as `coins - (n - num_cards)`.

3. **Output State**:
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `num_cards` remains `cards[1]`.
   - `remaining_coins` is updated to `coins - (n - num_cards)`.
   - `score` remains `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
   - `remaining_cards` remains a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`.
   - `max_score` remains the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[1]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is `cards[0] * 2 + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i = 2` and includes `remaining_coins`, `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
