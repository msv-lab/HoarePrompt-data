In the given code snippet, `trg` is assigned the value of `i * (a[i] - min_)`. However, the values of `a` and `min_` are not provided in the initial state. Since these values are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `trg`. But we know that `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `trg` is `n * (a[n] - min_)`**
