The code snippet `outs.append(tot)` appends the value of `tot` to the list `outs`. However, the value of `tot` itself does not change due to this line of code. The variables `n`, `k`, `min_`, `min_idx`, `i`, `a`, and `trg` remain in their original states unless they were affected by earlier parts of the code which are not shown here.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only change is the addition of `tot` to the list `outs`. Since the value of `tot` is already defined in the initial state, appending it to `outs` means that `outs` now contains `tot`.

Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `min_` is the original `min_` plus `k // n` if `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1` and `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `min_` remains unchanged; `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value; `i` is `n`; `a` is the sorted list; `trg` is `0`; `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`; `outs` is a list containing `tot`.**
