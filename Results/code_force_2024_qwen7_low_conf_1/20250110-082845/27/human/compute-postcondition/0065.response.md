`k` is decremented by `trg`. From the initial state, `trg` is defined as `i * (a[i] - min_)`. Therefore, `k` is now `k - (i * (a[i] - min_))`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - (i * (a[i] - min_))`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted based on the if condition, `min_idx` is either `i` or `i - 1` depending on the if condition, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`.**
