`k` is decremented by the value of `trg`. The value of `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, so `k` is now `k - i * (a[i] - min_)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `i * (a[i] - min_)`.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `i * (a[i] - min_)`**
