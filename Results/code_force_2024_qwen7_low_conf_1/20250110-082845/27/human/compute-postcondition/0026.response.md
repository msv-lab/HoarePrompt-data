The code snippet `remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)` updates the value of `remaining_coins`. From the initial state, we know:

- `i` is 3
- `n` is greater than 2
- `num_cards` is `cards[2]`
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`
- `score` is updated by adding `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to its current value
- `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`
- `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`

The code snippet does not affect the value of `i`, `n`, `num_cards`, `remaining_cards`, `score`, or `max_score`. It only updates `remaining_coins` to be `coins - (n - num_cards)`, which is already defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `num_cards` is `cards[2]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, `score` is updated by adding `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to its current value, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding 2 plus `remaining_coins`, and `max_score` is the maximum of the current `max_score` and the new `score`.**
