`min_` is incremented by `k // n`. Since `min_` is the minimum value in the list `a` and initially it is equal to the last element of `a` (because `min_idx` is `n - 1`), and `a` is sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the largest possible minimum value in `a`. The value of `k // n` is a non-negative integer. After the operation, the value of `min_` will be updated, but the exact new value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `k` and `n`. However, we know that `min_` will be at least `k // n` more than its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the same as the initial value, `outs` is an empty list, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of `min_` in the list `a`, `k` is greater than 0, and `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1**
