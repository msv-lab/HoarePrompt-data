The code assigns the value of `cards[i - 1]` to the variable `num_cards`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, the expression `i - 1` evaluates to 0. Assuming `cards` is an iterable (like a list) and `cards[0]` exists, `num_cards` will be assigned the value of `cards[0]`. The states of the other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`**
