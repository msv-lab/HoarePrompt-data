`min_` is incremented by `k // i`. The value of `k // i` is a specific integer division of `k` by `i`. The values of `outs`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `min_idx`, and `trg` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is adjusted according to the if condition, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` plus `k // i` adjusted based on the if condition, `min_idx` is either `i` or `i - 1` depending on the if condition, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`.**
