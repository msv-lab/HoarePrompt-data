Postcondition: ***`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is updated based on the if condition. If `k >= trg`, `k` is set to `k - (i * (a[i] - min_))` and `min_` is set to `a[i]` with `min_idx` being `i`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k % i` and `min_` is adjusted to the minimum value in `a` plus `k // i` with `min_idx` being `i - 1`. The most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
