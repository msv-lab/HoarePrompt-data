Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `num_cards` is `cards[0]`, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - cards[0])`, `score` is `cards[0] * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding `i` and includes `remaining_coins`, `max_score` is `score`, and `remaining_coins` is non-negative.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we only consider the if part's postcondition. The postcondition remains unchanged as the if condition ensures that `remaining_coins` is non-negative when the if block is executed.
