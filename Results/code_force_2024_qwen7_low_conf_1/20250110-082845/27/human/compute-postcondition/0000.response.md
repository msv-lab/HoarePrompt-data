The code `n = len(cards)` assigns the length of the list `cards` to the variable `n`. This means that `n` now holds the number of elements in the list `cards`.

The initial state includes that `cards` is a list of `n` integers representing the number of cards of each type, and `coins` is an integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards.

After executing the code, the value of `cards` remains unchanged, and the value of `coins` also remains unchanged. The only change is that `n` now holds the length of the `cards` list.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of n integers representing the number of cards of each type, `coins` is an integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards, `n` is the length of the list `cards`.**
