Postcondition: **`outs` is `[tot]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is adjusted according to the if condition, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the minimum value in `a` adjusted based on the if condition, `min_idx` is either `i` or `i - 1` depending on the if condition, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])` and `(k < trg)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
