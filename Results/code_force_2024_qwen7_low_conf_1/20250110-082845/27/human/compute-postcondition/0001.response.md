The code initializes `max_score` to 0, but does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the `cards` list and `coins` integer retain their initial values from the initial state, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of n integers representing the number of cards of each type, `coins` is an integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards, `n` is the length of the list `cards`, `max_score` is 0.**
