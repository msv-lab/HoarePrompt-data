Postcondition: ***`n` is the original value of `n`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `min_` is the original `min_` plus `k // n`, `min_idx` is the index of the minimum value, `i` is `n`, `a` is the sorted list, and `trg` is `0`. If `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1` and `k` is greater than `0`, then `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // n`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
