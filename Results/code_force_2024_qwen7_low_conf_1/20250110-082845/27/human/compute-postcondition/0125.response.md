The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block. In this case, it will exit the loop or if statement that it is inside, but it does not change the values of the variables outside that block. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is its original value; `a[i]` is its original value; `min_` is its original value + `k // i`; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - (min_ + k // i))`; `min_idx` is `i - 1`; `k` is `k % i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
