### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program and confirm the reasoning:

1. **Recursive Approach**: The function `func_1` is designed to explore all possible ways to distribute the coins by buying additional cards. However, the core logic of calculating the score based on the problem description is incorrect. The function aims to maximize the score by considering every possible way to distribute the coins but does not correctly compute the score of valid permutations.

2. **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The score is calculated as `num_cards * n`, which implies that buying more cards always increases the score linearly, which is not the intended behavior. The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Dynamic Nature of Buying Cards**: The program does not account for the fact that buying cards can create new valid permutations. For example, if you have `[6, 1, 8]` and you can buy 4 cards, you might buy 4 cards of type 2 to form `[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8]`, which could result in more valid permutations.

4. **Algorithmic Inefficiency**: The current approach is inefficient due to the recursive exploration of all possible distributions of coins. This can lead to exponential time complexity, making it impractical for large inputs.

5. **Lack of Permutation Validation**: The program does not check if the resulting array forms a valid permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. Instead, it focuses on the count of cards, which does not align with the problem's requirement.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the score based on the problem description and does not account for the dynamic nature of buying and rearranging cards to maximize the score.
