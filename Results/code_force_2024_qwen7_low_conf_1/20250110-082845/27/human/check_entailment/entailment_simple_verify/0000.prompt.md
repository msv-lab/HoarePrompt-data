You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

- Program: 
def func_1(cards, coins):
    n = len(cards)
    max_score = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        num_cards = cards[i - 1]
        if num_cards > 0:
            remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)
            if remaining_coins >= 0:
                score = num_cards * n
                remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]
                remaining_cards.append(remaining_coins)
                score += func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)
                max_score = max(max_score, score)
    return max_score



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cards is a list of n integers representing the number of cards of each type, where each type is numbered from 1 to n. coins is an integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards, and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, 0 ≤ coins ≤ 10^{12}.

        if num_cards > 0:
            remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)
            if remaining_coins >= 0:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_score` is the maximum score achieved when `remaining_coins >= 0` across all iterations, `i` is the last iteration number that satisfied the condition, `n` is the length of the list `cards`, `remaining_coins` is the remaining coins after the last valid iteration (if any), and `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding the types of cards that were bought (if any).
    return max_score
    #The program returns max_score which is the maximum score achieved when remaining_coins >= 0 across all iterations



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the approach taken in the `func_1` function is not appropriate for finding the maximum score. The function attempts to recursively explore different ways to distribute the coins but does not correctly calculate the score based on the problem description.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
- Input:
  ```
  2
  3 4
  6 1 8
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  22
  ```

However, the provided program will not produce the correct output. The correct approach would involve calculating how many contiguous subarrays of length `n` can be formed after buying up to `k` new cards such that they form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

The provided solution does not account for the correct scoring mechanism and the dynamic nature of buying and rearranging cards to maximize the score. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
