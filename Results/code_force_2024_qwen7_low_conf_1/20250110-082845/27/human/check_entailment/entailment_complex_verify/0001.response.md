### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several key issues with the provided function `func_1`. Let's re-evaluate the code with a more detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Scoring**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the score should be based on the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The current implementation calculates `num_cards * n`, which is not the correct scoring mechanism.

2. **Recursive Approach**:
   - The function attempts to recursively buy cards of a specific type `i` and then calls itself with the remaining cards and coins. However, this approach is overly simplistic and doesn't necessarily lead to the optimal solution. The problem requires a more sophisticated strategy to maximize the score, considering how to optimally spend the coins across different card types.

3. **Handling Remaining Cards**:
   - The line `remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]` removes all cards of type `i`, which is not necessary. Additionally, appending `remaining_coins` to `remaining_cards` is incorrect because it doesn't accurately represent the state after buying cards.

4. **Termination Condition**:
   - The function lacks a proper base case to terminate the recursion and calculate the score correctly. Without a clear stopping point, the recursion will continue indefinitely or lead to incorrect results.

However, the original assessment makes an incorrect conclusion by stating that the function does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The core issue is not that the function is entirely wrong but rather that the logic is flawed and needs significant improvement.

To properly address the problem, the function would need a more complex approach, possibly involving dynamic programming or a different recursive strategy that considers all possible ways to distribute the coins among the card types.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws but may have overstated the severity of the issues without providing a clear path to a correct solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the current implementation but might have been overly pessimistic in concluding that the program is entirely incorrect. A more nuanced understanding of the issues and potential improvements would be needed to fully address the problem.
