Reasoning:

Upon reviewing the original assessment, I find that the initial analysis correctly identifies several flaws in the provided function `func_1`. However, the conclusion that the function is entirely incorrect might be too harsh, given that some aspects of the function are attempting to address the problem in a way that is fundamentally flawed but could be corrected with proper implementation.

1. **Incorrect Logic for Scoring**: The original assessment correctly points out that the current scoring method `num_cards * n` is not accurate. The score should be based on the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This requires a different approach to calculate the score accurately.

2. **Recursive Approach**: The recursive function aims to try different combinations of buying cards, which is a good idea in principle. However, the current implementation is flawed in how it calculates and updates the score and the state of the cards.

3. **Handling Remaining Cards**: The function attempts to handle the remaining cards by removing the current card type and adding the remaining coins, which is incorrect and unnecessary for the problem's solution.

4. **Termination Condition**: The function lacks a proper termination condition that would correctly compute the score once the best combination of card buys is found.

To properly evaluate the correctness of the function, let's break down the required steps to solve the problem:

- Calculate the initial score without any card purchases.
- Consider the effect of buying cards of each type on the score.
- Use dynamic programming or another efficient method to keep track of the best score achievable with the remaining coins.

While the current implementation has significant flaws, it captures the essence of the solution: trying different combinations of card purchases to maximize the score. With the right adjustments and corrections, the function can be made to work correctly.

Given these considerations, the original assessment may be too critical. While the current implementation is not correct, it is on the right track conceptually.

Final: **False**
