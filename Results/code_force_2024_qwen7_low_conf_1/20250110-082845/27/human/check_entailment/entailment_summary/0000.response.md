Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Recursive Approach**: The function `func_1` uses recursion to explore different combinations of buying additional cards. However, the logic for calculating the score and deciding whether to buy additional cards is flawed.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Score**: The score calculation in the provided code assumes that buying additional cards of a certain type will always contribute to forming valid permutations. This is not true because the goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
3. **Incorrect Handling of Coins**: The function deducts coins based on the current count of cards but does not ensure that the bought cards will form valid permutations. This leads to incorrect scores being calculated.
4. **Lack of Direct Permutation Check**: The function does not directly check if the current arrangement of cards forms valid permutations of length `n`. Instead, it relies on a recursive approach which is overly complex and does not guarantee the optimal solution.

Given these issues, the provided implementation does not accurately solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
