Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem recursively by trying to maximize the score. However, there are several issues with the approach:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Scoring**: The function calculates the score as `num_cards * n` which is not correct. The score should be based on the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This cannot be directly calculated using `num_cards * n`.

2. **Recursive Approach**: The recursive function tries to buy cards of a specific type `i` and then call itself with the remaining cards and coins. This is a suboptimal approach because it doesn't consider the best way to distribute the coins across different card types to maximize the score.

3. **Handling Remaining Cards**: The line `remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]` removes all cards of type `i`, which is not necessary. Also, appending `remaining_coins` to `remaining_cards` is incorrect as it doesn't reflect the actual state of having bought cards.

4. **Termination Condition**: The function lacks a proper base case to terminate the recursion and calculate the score correctly.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
