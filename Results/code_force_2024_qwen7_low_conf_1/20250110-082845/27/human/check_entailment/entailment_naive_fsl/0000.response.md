Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the approach taken in the `func_1` function is not appropriate for finding the maximum score. The function attempts to recursively explore different ways to distribute the coins but does not correctly calculate the score based on the problem description.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
- Input:
  ```
  2
  3 4
  6 1 8
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  22
  ```

However, the provided program will not produce the correct output. The correct approach would involve calculating how many contiguous subarrays of length `n` can be formed after buying up to `k` new cards such that they form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

The provided solution does not account for the correct scoring mechanism and the dynamic nature of buying and rearranging cards to maximize the score. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
