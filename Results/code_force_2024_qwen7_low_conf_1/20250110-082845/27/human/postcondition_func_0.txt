The function `func_1` accepts a list `cards` and an integer `coins`. It recursively calculates the maximum score achievable by buying additional cards with the available coins. For each card type, if there are still cards left, it computes the score by buying those cards and recursively calling itself with the updated list of cards and coins. The function keeps track of the maximum score achieved across all iterations where the remaining coins are non-negative. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the maximum score (`max_score`) achieved under these conditions. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no cards can be bought due to insufficient coins, and the function handles these by skipping the iteration and continuing with the next one.
