#State of the program right berfore the function call: cards is a list of n integers representing the number of cards of each type, where each type is numbered from 1 to n. coins is an integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards, and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, 0 ≤ coins ≤ 10^{12}.
def func_1(cards, coins):
    n = len(cards)
    max_score = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        num_cards = cards[i - 1]
        
        if num_cards > 0:
            remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)
            if remaining_coins >= 0:
                score = num_cards * n
                remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]
                remaining_cards.append(remaining_coins)
                score += func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)
                max_score = max(max_score, score)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_score` is the maximum score achieved when `remaining_coins >= 0` across all iterations, `i` is the last iteration number that satisfied the condition, `n` is the length of the list `cards`, `remaining_coins` is the remaining coins after the last valid iteration (if any), and `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` excluding the types of cards that were bought (if any).
    return max_score
    #The program returns max_score which is the maximum score achieved when remaining_coins >= 0 across all iterations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `cards` and an integer `coins`. It recursively calculates the maximum score achievable by buying additional cards with the available coins. For each card type, if there are still cards left, it computes the score by buying those cards and recursively calling itself with the updated list of cards and coins. The function keeps track of the maximum score achieved across all iterations where the remaining coins are non-negative. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the maximum score (`max_score`) achieved under these conditions. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no cards can be bought due to insufficient coins, and the function handles these by skipping the iteration and continuing with the next one.
