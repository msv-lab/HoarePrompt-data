Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of ways to generate a specific prefix sum array `p` after sorting, given the constraints.
   - It uses dynamic programming to build a DP table `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `j - n` using the first `i` elements of the original array `a`.
   - The function iteratively updates the `dp` table, ensuring that each element in the new `dp` array is the sum of all elements in the original `dp` array that were greater than zero.
   - Finally, it returns the value at the index `p[-1] + n`, which corresponds to the number of ways to achieve the given prefix sum array after sorting.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - It correctly handles the reading of input and processing of each test case, ensuring that the input is read in the expected format.
   - The function ensures that the result of each test case is stored in a list `results` and printed at the end.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The overall logic of the program aligns with the problem statement.
   - `func_1` correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to calculate the number of valid arrays `a` for a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each test case.
   - There are no apparent logical errors or missing functionalities in the provided code.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
