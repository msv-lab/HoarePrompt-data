Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the number of initial arrays \(a\) (consisting of 1s and -1s) that produce a given sorted prefix sum array \(p\) after sorting the prefix sums of \(a\).
2. **Key Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function aims to simulate the transformation from an array \(a\) to the sorted prefix sum array \(p\). However, the logic implemented in `func_1` does not accurately model the process described in the problem. Specifically, it uses dynamic programming to generate a distribution of prefix sums, but it does not correctly reflect the transformation of \(a\) to \(p\).
   - **func_2**: This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1`. While the input reading and output writing are correct, the core logic in `func_1` is flawed.

Given the description of the problem and the provided code, the key issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`. The intended logic should involve checking the possible transformations of the array \(a\) to see if they match the given sorted prefix sum array \(p\). Instead, `func_1` incorrectly simulates a different process.

Therefore, since the core function (`func_1`) does not correctly implement the solution to the problem, the overall program cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
