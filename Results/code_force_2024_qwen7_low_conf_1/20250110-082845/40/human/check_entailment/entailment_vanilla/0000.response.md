Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by using dynamic programming (DP) to count the number of possible arrays `a` that would produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes a DP array `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for the middle element (`offset`) which is set to 1.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n`, updating the `dp` array based on the previous values. This involves adding the value at the current position to the positions one step to the left and right, effectively simulating the effect of adding a `1` or `-1` to the prefix sum array.
   - Finally, it calculates the `final_sum` based on the last element of `p` and returns the corresponding value in the `dp` array.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes it to extract the number of test cases and the data for each test case, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It then prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The logic of `func_1` is correct in terms of how it simulates the addition of `1` and `-1` to the prefix sums and updates the DP table accordingly.
  - However, there are a few potential issues to consider:
    - The modulo operation is correctly applied at each step to avoid overflow.
    - The offset calculation and the final sum calculation seem appropriate for the problem.
  - The function correctly handles the prefix sums and their sorting.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The function reads input correctly and processes it to call `func_1` for each test case.
  - It then prints the results, which is expected behavior.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The constraints are handled correctly, as the code reads up to `5000` elements per test case and the total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed `5000`.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required limit.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic and handling of the problem are correct, and the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
