Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function uses dynamic programming to count the number of possible arrays `a` that would produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The initialization of the `dp` array with `dp[n] = 1` represents the base case where we have an empty prefix sum array.
   - The loop iterates through each position `i` from 1 to `n` and updates the `dp` array by adding the value at the current position to the positions one step to the left and right.
   - Finally, the function calculates the `final_sum` based on the last element of `p` and returns the corresponding value in the `dp` array.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function reads the input from standard input, processes it to extract the number of test cases and the data for each test case, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It then prints the results for each test case, ensuring that the output is correctly formatted and within the required modulo limit.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The logic of `func_1` is fundamentally sound in simulating the addition of `1` and `-1` to the prefix sums and updating the DP table accordingly.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and fits within the required limit.
  - The offset calculation and the final sum calculation are correct.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The function `func_2` reads the input correctly and processes it to call `func_1` for each test case.
  - It then prints the results, which is expected behavior.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The constraints are correctly handled, as the code reads up to `5000` elements per test case and the total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed `5000`.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required limit.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- The provided function summary mentions that the function assumes correctly formatted input and does not handle invalid inputs. This is a valid concern, but the problem statement specifies valid inputs, so we can assume the input is correctly formatted.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering the problem constraints and the provided function summary, it appears that the logic and handling of the problem are correct, and the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

**Final: True**
