### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its behavior to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Given a sorted prefix sum array \( p \), we need to count the number of possible initial arrays \( a \) (consisting of 1s and -1s) that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array \( p \).

#### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - Initializes a DP array `dp` of size \( 2n + 1 \) with all zeros.
   - Sets the middle element `dp[n]` to 1.
   - Iteratively updates `dp` to simulate the process of adding 1s and -1s to construct the prefix sums.
   - Finally, returns `dp[p[-1] + n]`, which should represent the number of ways to form the given prefix sum array.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Prints the results for each test case.

#### Key Observations and Issues:

1. **DP Initialization and Update**:
   - The initialization `dp[n] = 1` suggests that there is one way to have a sum of 0 at the midpoint.
   - The update step `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` aims to propagate the counts of prefix sums.
   - However, this approach does not correctly simulate the construction of prefix sums from the array \( a \). It instead seems to be attempting a combinatorial approach to count paths in a graph, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided example for test case 5 (`[-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`) is handled incorrectly by the current implementation.
   - The combinatorial approach does not guarantee that the resulting prefix sums will match the given sorted array \( p \).

3. **Combinatorial Counting vs. Prefix Sum Construction**:
   - The combinatorial approach used in `func_1` is fundamentally different from the problem's requirement to reconstruct the prefix sums.
   - The current implementation does not account for the specific constraints and properties of the prefix sums and their sorting.

#### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided code does not correctly simulate the process of constructing the prefix sums from the array \( a \). The combinatorial approach used in `func_1` is not aligned with the problem's requirements, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**False**
