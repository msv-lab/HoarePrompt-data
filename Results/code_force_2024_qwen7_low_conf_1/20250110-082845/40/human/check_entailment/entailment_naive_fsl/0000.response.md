Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly simulate the process of constructing the prefix sums and sorting them. The approach taken in `func_1` seems to be more related to a combinatorial problem rather than directly simulating the construction of prefix sums from the array `a`.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- Test Case 5: Input is `[-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`. The correct answer is `1`, as the only possible array `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]`.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not produce the correct results for many cases. For instance, it incorrectly handles the distribution of values and the construction of prefix sums, leading to wrong counts.

A correct implementation would involve simulating the process of constructing prefix sums from an array of `1`s and `-1`s and ensuring that the resulting sorted prefix sums match the given array `p`. The current approach does not accurately reflect this process, hence it fails in many scenarios.
