The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)) and `p` (a sorted list of \(n\) integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\)). It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size \(2n + 1\) with the first element set to 1. The function then iterates over the range from 1 to \(n\) and updates a new `dp` array based on the previous values, ensuring that each element in the new `dp` array is the sum of all elements in the original `dp` array that were greater than zero. After completing the loop, it calculates the final sum as `p[-1] + n` and returns the value at this index in the `dp` array.
