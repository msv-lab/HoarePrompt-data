Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros with `dp[n]` being 1, `new_dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros, and `j` is 0. If `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
