The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `result`, `results`, and `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `index` is `index + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index-1])`, `index` is `index + 2*int(data[index-1]) + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index-1:index + int(data[index-1])]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(int(data[index-1]), p)`, `results` is a list containing `result`, `t` must be greater than 0**
