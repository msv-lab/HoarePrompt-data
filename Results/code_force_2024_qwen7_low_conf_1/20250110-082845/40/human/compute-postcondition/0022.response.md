The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as follows:

- `n` is still `int(data[index])`
- `index` is now `index + int(data[index-1]) + 1`
- `p` is still a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers
- `result` is still the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
- `results` is still a list containing `result` and the previous elements
- `t` is still greater than 1

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index-1]) + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result` and the previous elements, `t` must be greater than 1**
