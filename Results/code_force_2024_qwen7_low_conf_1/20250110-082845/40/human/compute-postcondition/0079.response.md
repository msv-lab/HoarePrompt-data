`final_sum` is assigned the value `p[-1] + offset`. Here, `p[-1]` is the last element of the list `p`, which is an integer with a value between `-n` and `n`, and `offset` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `final_sum` is the sum of the last element of `p` and `n`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers where each element is the sum of all elements in the original `dp` list that were greater than zero, `new_dp` is equal to `dp`, `final_sum` is `p[-1] + n`**
