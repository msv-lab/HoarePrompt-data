The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `n` is now `int(data[index])`
- `index` remains `index + 2*n`
- `p` is still a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers
- `result` remains the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
- `results` is still a list containing `result`
- `t` must still be greater than 0

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `index` is `index + 2*int(data[index])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + int(data[index])]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(int(data[index]), p)`, `results` is a list containing `result`, `t` must be greater than 0**
