`index` is incremented by `n`. The value of `n` is `int(data[index])`, which means `n` remains the same as it was before the increment. The other variables (`index`, `p`, `result`, `results`, `t`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `index`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index]) + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result` and the previous elements, `t` must be greater than 1; `index` is increased by `n`.**
