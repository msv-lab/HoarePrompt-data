Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers equal to `new_dp`, `new_dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers, all elements of which are 0, and the current value of `j` is 0 (or any value within the range 0 to \(2n\)), and `dp[j]` is greater than 0. Additionally, since the if condition is `(j + 1 <= 2 * n)` and it evaluates to true, the current value of `j` remains within the range 0 to \(2n\).**
