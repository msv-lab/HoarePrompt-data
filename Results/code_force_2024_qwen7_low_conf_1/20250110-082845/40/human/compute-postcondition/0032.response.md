According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a non-empty list, `res` is the next value in the list, and `res` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must be the next value in the list, and the list `results` must still be non-empty.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a non-empty list.
2. `res` is the next value in the list.
3. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be a non-empty list, and `res` must be the next value in the list.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list; `res` is the next value in the list**
