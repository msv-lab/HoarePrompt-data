The code snippet `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` impacts the program by updating the value of `p`. Initially, `p` was defined as a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index-1:index + int(data[index-1])]` to integers. Now, `p` is being reassigned to a new list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is `int(data[index-1])`
- `index` is `index + 2*int(data[index-1]) + 1`
- `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index-1:index + int(data[index-1])]` to integers
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(int(data[index-1]), p)`
- `results` is a list containing `result`
- `t` must be greater than 0

After the code is executed, the value of `p` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index-1])`, `index` is `index + 2*int(data[index-1]) + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(int(data[index-1]), p)`, `results` is a list containing `result`, `t` must be greater than 0**
