`results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. The variables `n`, `index`, and `p` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the `results` list.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `index` is `index + 2*n`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result`**
