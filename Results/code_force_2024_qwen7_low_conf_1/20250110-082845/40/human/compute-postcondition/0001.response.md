The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The variable `data` is assigned this list. The previous values of `t`, `n`, and `p` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers such that |p_i| ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
