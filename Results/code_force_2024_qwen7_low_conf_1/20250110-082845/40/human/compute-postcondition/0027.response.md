Output State: **`t` is the final value of `t` after the loop, `n` is `int(data[index - 2 * t])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index - 2 * t]) + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index - int(data[index - 2 * t]):index]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1` for each iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is the position in `data` after processing all the input, `results` is a list of the outputs of `func_1`.**
