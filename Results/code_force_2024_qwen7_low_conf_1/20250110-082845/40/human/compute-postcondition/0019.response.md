The code appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index-1])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index-1])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result` and the previous elements, `t` must be greater than 0**
