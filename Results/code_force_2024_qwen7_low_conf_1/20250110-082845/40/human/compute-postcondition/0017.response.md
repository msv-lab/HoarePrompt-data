`index` is incremented by `n`. The value of `n` is `int(data[index-1])`, so `index` is updated to `index + int(data[index-1])`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index-1])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index-1])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(int(data[index-1]), p)`, `results` is a list containing `result`, `t` must be greater than 0**
