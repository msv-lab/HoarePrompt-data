The line `input = sys.stdin.read` does not actually execute any operation that changes the state of variables. It simply reassigns the global `input` function to read from standard input in a different manner. However, this change does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`. The precondition remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `p` is a list of n integers such that |p_i| ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The global `input` function is now `sys.stdin.read`.**
