In the initial state, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros with `dp[n]` being 1, `new_dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros, and `j` is 2. If `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, then `new_dp[3]` is `dp[2] % MOD`.

The code snippet updates `new_dp[j - 1]` which in this case is `new_dp[1]` to be `(new_dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD`. Given the initial conditions, we know that `new_dp[1]` is initially 0 and `dp[2]` is 0 because `dp` is initialized to all zeros. Therefore, `new_dp[1]` becomes `(0 + 0) % MOD` which is `0`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros with `dp[n]` being 1, `new_dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros with `new_dp[1]` being 0, and `j` is 2.**
