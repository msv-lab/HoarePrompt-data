Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers equal to `new_dp`, and `j` is \(2n\). If `dp[j] > 0` and \(j - 1 \geq 0\), then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\); otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
