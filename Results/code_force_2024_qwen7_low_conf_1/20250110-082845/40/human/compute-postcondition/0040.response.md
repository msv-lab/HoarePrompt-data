In the initial state, the value of `j` is 0. The code snippet `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` with `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Given that `j` is now 1, we are updating `new_dp[1]` with the sum of `new_dp[1]` and `dp[0]` modulo `MOD`.

Since `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros with `dp[n]` being 1, the value of `dp[0]` is 0. Therefore, the update becomes:

\[ new_dp[1] = (new_dp[1] + dp[0]) \% MOD = (new_dp[1] + 0) \% MOD = new_dp[1] \% MOD \]

Given that `new_dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros initially, `new_dp[1]` is 0. So, the updated value of `new_dp[1]` remains 0.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros with `dp[n]` being 1, `new_dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros with `new_dp[1]` being 0, and `j` is 1.**
