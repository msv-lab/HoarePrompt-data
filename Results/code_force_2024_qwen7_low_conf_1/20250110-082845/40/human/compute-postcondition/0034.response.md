Output State: **`results` is a list containing the outputs of `func_1` for each iteration, `res` is the last value in the list `results`, and `res` is printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each element.
- The `results` list contains the return values of `func_1` for each iteration.
- Since the loop iterates over `results`, it will print each value in the list in order.
- After the loop finishes executing, `res` will be the last value in the `results` list and will be printed.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `results` is an empty list), then `results` will remain an empty list, and since there are no values to print, nothing will be printed.
