The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` impacts the program by converting a slice of the `data` list from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers and assigning it to `p`. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 1`.

- `n` is the length of the slice being converted.
- `index` is incremented by `n`.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data`.

Output State: **`n` is int(data[index]), `index` is index + n, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting data[index:index + n] to integers**
