`res` is printed using the `print` function, but the value of `res` itself does not change. The value of `results` remains a non-empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `results` is a non-empty list; `res` is the next value in the list; `res` is printed.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list; `res` is the next value in the list; `res` is printed**
