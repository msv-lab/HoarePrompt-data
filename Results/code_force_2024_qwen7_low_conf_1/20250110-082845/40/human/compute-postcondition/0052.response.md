The code `dp = new_dp` assigns the list `new_dp` to the variable `dp`. This means that `dp` now holds the same values as `new_dp`, and `new_dp` remains unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `offset` is `n`
- `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\)
- `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros with `dp[n]` being 1
- `new_dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers where `new_dp[k]` is the sum of `dp[j]` for all `j` such that `dp[j] > 0` and `k` is within the valid range of indices, and `j` is \(2n\)

After the code execution, `dp` will have the same values as `new_dp`, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers where `new_dp[k]` is the sum of `dp[j]` for all `j` such that `dp[j] > 0` and `k` is within the valid range of indices, and `j` is \(2n\)**.
