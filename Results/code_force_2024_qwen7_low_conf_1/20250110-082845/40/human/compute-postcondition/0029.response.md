The code `print(res)` prints the value of the variable `res`. However, in the initial state, `results` is a non-empty list, and there is no indication that `res` is assigned a value from `results` or any other variable. Therefore, the value of `res` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state, and the code does not change the value of `results`. The output of the print statement will be the current value of `res`, but since `res` is not reassigned or otherwise manipulated in the code, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `res` is its current value**
