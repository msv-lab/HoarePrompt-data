The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly listed in the function signature. However, based on the problem description, it seems the function should operate on certain variables (`t`, `n`, and `p`) which are not passed as arguments but are implied to be present in the function's scope.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers such that \(|p_i| \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\), and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The function has two cases for its output:
- **Case_1:** `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). If `t` is less than `n`, the function returns `t`.
- **Case_2:** If `t` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a sorted list `p` (though not passed as parameters), and return `t` if `t` is less than `n`, otherwise return `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a sorted list `p` (not passed as parameters), and returns `t` if `t` is less than `n`, otherwise returns `n`.**
