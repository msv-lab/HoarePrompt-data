The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. The value of `j` is `k + 1`, so `new_dp[k]` is updated. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers equal to `new_dp`, `j` is `k + 1`, and `new_dp[k]` is updated to `(new_dp[k] + dp[k + 1]) % MOD`.
