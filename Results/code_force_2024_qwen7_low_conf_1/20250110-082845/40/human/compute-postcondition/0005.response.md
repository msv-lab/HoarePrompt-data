The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, and `index`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is equal to the first element of `data` (i.e., `data[0]`), `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers such that |p_i| ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**
