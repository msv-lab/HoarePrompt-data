The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, which was calculated in the previous execution. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index - n])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index - n]) + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index - n:index]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result` and the previous elements, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is updated by appending `result`**
