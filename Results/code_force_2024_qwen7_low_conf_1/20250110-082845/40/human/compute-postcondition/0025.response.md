`result` is assigned the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. This means `result` now holds the value returned by the function `func_1`, which takes `n` and the list `p` as arguments. The values of `n`, `index`, `p`, `result`, `results`, and `t` are updated accordingly. The state of `index` is increased by `n`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index - n])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index - n]) + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index - n:index]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result` and the previous elements, `t` must be greater than 1**
