The code updates the value of `n` to be `int(data[index])`. The previous value of `n` was `int(data[index-1])`, so now `n` is updated to `int(data[index])`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index-1])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result` and the previous elements, `t` must be greater than 1**
