The code snippet updates `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Since the initial value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is 0 and `dp[j]` is greater than 0, `new_dp[j + 1]` will be assigned the value of `dp[j]`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `new_dp[j + 1]` is initially 0.
2. The code snippet adds `dp[j]` to `new_dp[j + 1]` and takes the result modulo `MOD`.
3. Since `dp[j]` is greater than 0, the new value of `new_dp[j + 1]` will be `dp[j]`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `new_dp[j + 1]` is now `dp[j]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers equal to `new_dp`, `new_dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers, all elements of which are 0, and the current value of `j` is 0 (or any value within the range 0 to \(2n\)), and `new_dp[j + 1]` is equal to `dp[j]`.**
