According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of the variables are as follows:

- `n` is `int(data[index])`
- `index` is `index + 2*n`
- `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
- `results` is a list containing `result`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `t` is not directly modified within the loop body, the values of `n`, `index`, `p`, `result`, and `results` remain unchanged from the previous iteration. The only condition that needs to be checked is whether `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `index` is `index + 2*n`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result`, `t` must be greater than 0**
