To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
1. **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `n` is `int(data[index-1])`
   - `index` is `index + int(data[index-1])`
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
   - `results` is a list containing `result` and the previous elements
   - `t` must be greater than 0

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates `t` times.
- The variable `_` is used as a dummy variable since the loop does not depend on an index.
- The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is determined by `int(data[index-1])`.
   - `index` is updated to `index + int(data[index-1])`.
   - `p` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.
   - `result` is the output of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `results` contains `result` and potentially previous results.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

### Updated States:
- `n` remains unchanged since it is determined at the beginning and is not affected by the loop.
- `index` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- `p` remains unchanged since it is determined by `data[index:index + n]` and is not affected by the loop.
- `result` is the output of `func_1(n, p)` and remains unchanged.
- `results` is updated with the current `result` but remains otherwise unchanged.
- `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` must now be `t - 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is `int(data[index-1])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index-1])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result` and the previous elements, `t` must be greater than 1**
