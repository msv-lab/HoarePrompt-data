The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. According to the initial state, `index` is already `index + n`, so adding `n` to it will result in `index` being updated to `(index + n) + n`, which simplifies to `index + 2*n`.

Other variables (`n`, `p`, and `data`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is int(data[index]), `index` is index + 2*n, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting data[index:index + n] to integers**
