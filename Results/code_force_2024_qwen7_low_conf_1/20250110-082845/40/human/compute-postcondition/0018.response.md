The code updates the value of `result` by calling `func_1(n, p)` with the current values of `n` and `p`. The previous value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(int(data[index-1]), p)`, which means `result` is now the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index-1])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index-1])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result`, `t` must be greater than 0**
