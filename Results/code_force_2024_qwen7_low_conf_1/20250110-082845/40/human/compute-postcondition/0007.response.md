`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is converted to an integer using the `int` function, which affects the value of `n`. The state of the variable `index` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is int(data[index]), `index` is unchanged**
