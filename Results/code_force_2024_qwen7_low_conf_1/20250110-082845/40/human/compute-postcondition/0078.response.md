Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers where each element is the sum of all elements in the original `dp` list that were greater than zero, and `new_dp` is equal to `dp`.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `offset` is `n`.
   - `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\).
   - `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros with `dp[n]` being 1.
   - `new_dp` is initialized to a list of \(2n + 1\) zeros.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`.
   - For each iteration, `new_dp` is reset to a list of zeros.
   - The inner loop updates `new_dp` based on the values in `dp`.

3. **First Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
   - `new_dp` is updated to reflect the cumulative sums from `dp`.
   - `dp` is then updated to `new_dp`.

4. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - Each iteration of the outer loop further accumulates the sums into `dp`.
   - After `i` iterations, `dp` contains the cumulative sums of all elements that were initially greater than zero in the original `dp` list.

5. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `dp` will contain the final cumulative sums.
   - `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs `n + 1` times.
   - `new_dp` will be equal to `dp` after the last iteration.

Thus, the final output state is that `i` is `n + 1`, and `dp` contains the accumulated sums of all elements that were initially greater than zero in the original `dp` list.
