The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` changes the value of `p`. It maps the integers in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` and assigns this new list to `p`. 

Since the initial state specifies that `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, the mapping operation does not change the content of `p` because it is already in the form of integers. However, the code explicitly converts the slice again, which means `p` will now be a fresh list with the same values as before.

The other variables (`index`, `result`, `results`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `index` is `index + int(data[index-1]) + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list containing `result` and the previous elements, `t` must be greater than 1; `p` is freshly mapped from the slice `data[index:index + n]`**
