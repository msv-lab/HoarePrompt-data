The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `p`, which is a list of `n` integers where |p[i]| ≤ n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns the sum of all elements in the original list (assumed to be `dp`) that were greater than zero, indexed by `p[-1] + n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer) and `p` (a sorted list of integers), and returns the sum of all elements in the original `dp` list that were greater than zero, indexed by `p[-1] + n`.**
