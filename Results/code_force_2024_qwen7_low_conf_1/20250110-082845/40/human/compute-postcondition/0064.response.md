Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `offset` is `n`
- `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\)
- `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers equal to `new_dp`
- If `dp[j] > 0` and `j - 1 \geq 0`, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD`.
- `new_dp[j + 1]` remains equal to `dp[j]` if `j + 1 \leq 2n`.
- Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(2 * n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `2 * n`.
2. **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the values of `i`, `n`, `offset`, `p`, `dp`, and `new_dp`.

Given the loop condition `for j in range(2 * n + 1)`, the loop will execute for each value of `j` from `0` to `2 * n`.

Since the loop is iterating over `j` and we need to determine the state after the current iteration (before moving to the next `j`), we need to consider how the loop updates the state.

3. **Update Conditions**:
   - If `dp[j] > 0` and `j - 1 \geq 0`, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD`.
   - `new_dp[j + 1]` remains equal to `dp[j]` if `j + 1 \leq 2n`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
- **Variable `j`**: The loop will increment `j` in each iteration.
- **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be some value within the range `[0, 2 * n)`.

For the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be the current value of `j` plus 1.

### Updated State:
- Since the loop is about to enter the next iteration, the value of `j` will be `current_j + 1`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `offset`, `p`, `dp`, and `new_dp`) will remain the same unless they are explicitly updated within the loop body, which is not specified here.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that changes in a predictable manner is `j`. Thus, we adjust the state to reflect the next value of `j`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers equal to `new_dp`, `j` is `current_j + 1`**.

Given the initial value of `j` was not explicitly stated but it implies it is within the range `[0, 2 * n)`, let's assume the current `j` value before the next iteration is `k`. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `k + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers equal to `new_dp`, `j` is `k + 1`**.
