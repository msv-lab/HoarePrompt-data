Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` followed by an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments, stores the result, and then prints the result after processing all test cases. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the output directly. If `t` is less than `n`, it processes up to `t` test cases; otherwise, it processes all `n` test cases. An edge case to consider is when `t` is exactly equal to `n`, in which case it will process exactly `t` test cases. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; however, the function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle invalid inputs.**
