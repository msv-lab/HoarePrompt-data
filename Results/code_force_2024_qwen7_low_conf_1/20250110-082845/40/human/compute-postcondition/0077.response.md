The code `dp = new_dp` simply assigns the value of `new_dp` to `dp`. This means that `dp` now holds the same values as `new_dp`, but `new_dp` itself remains unchanged. Given the precondition, the values of `new_dp` depend on the accumulated sums based on the values in `dp` where `dp[j] > 0`.

Since the code does not perform any additional operations on `new_dp` and just reassigns `dp` to `new_dp`, the value of `new_dp` remains as calculated by the previous logic (which was not explicitly shown in this snippet but assumed to have been computed based on the rules provided).

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` contains the accumulated sums based on the values in `dp` where `dp[j] > 0`.**
