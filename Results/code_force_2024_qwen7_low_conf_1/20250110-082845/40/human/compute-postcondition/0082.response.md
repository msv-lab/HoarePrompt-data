Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)) and `p` (a sorted list of \(n\) integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\)). It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size \(2n + 1\) with the first element set to 1. The function then iterates over the range from 1 to \(n\) and updates a new `dp` array based on the previous values, ensuring that each element in the new `dp` array is the sum of all elements in the original `dp` array that were greater than zero. After completing the loop, it calculates the final sum as `p[-1] + n` and returns the value at this index in the `dp` array.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, the function will only update the `dp` array once and return the value at `dp[p[0] + 1]`.
- If `p` contains negative values, the function correctly handles them within the constraints \(|p[i]| \leq n\).

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that `new_dp` is equal to `dp` at the end of the loop, which is redundant since `dp` is already updated to `new_dp` before the next iteration. This detail can be ignored as it does not affect the final state of the program.
