According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `res` and the list `results`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is its current value (let's call it `current_res`), and `results` is a non-empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `res` needs to be the next element in the list `results`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `res` is set to the current value (`current_res`).
2. The list `results` is still non-empty, meaning there are more elements left to iterate over.
3. For the loop to execute again, `res` must be assigned to the next element in the list `results`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `res` is the next value in the list**
