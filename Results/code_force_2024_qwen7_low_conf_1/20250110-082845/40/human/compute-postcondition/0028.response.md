Let's break down the given state and the for loop to understand what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State Before the Loop Starts:
- `t` is the final value of `t` after the loop.
- `n` is calculated as `int(data[index - 2 * t])`.
- `index` is updated to `index + int(data[index - 2 * t]) + 1`.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index - int(data[index - 2 * t]):index]` to integers.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1` for each iteration.
- `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is the position in `data` after processing all the input.
- `results` is a list of the outputs of `func_1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for res in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Pre-Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop is iterating over `results`, which means `results` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - We don't need to modify `t`, `n`, `index`, `p`, `result`, `data`, or `index` since these are not used directly in the loop itself.
   
2. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop condition `for res in results` ensures that `results` is a non-empty list.
   - The variable `res` in the loop is an element from the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. This is the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can proceed.

### Final Answer:
State: **`results` is a non-empty list**
