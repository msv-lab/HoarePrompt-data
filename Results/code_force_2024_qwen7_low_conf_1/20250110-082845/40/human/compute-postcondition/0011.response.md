The code `result = func_1(n, p)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `p`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its exact behavior or return value. However, we know that `n` and `p` will be passed as arguments to `func_1`. The state of `index` will also be updated according to the line `index = index + 2*n`. The variable `result` will hold the return value from `func_1`, but since the function's implementation is not provided, we cannot specify what that return value is.

Given the information, the output state will be:

- `n` is `int(data[index])`
- `index` is updated to `index + 2*n`
- `p` remains the same list of integers
- `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `index` is `index + 2*n`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
