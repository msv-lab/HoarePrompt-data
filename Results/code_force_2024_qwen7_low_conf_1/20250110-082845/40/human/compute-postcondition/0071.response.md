The code snippet updates `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state, the only affected variable is `new_dp[j + 1]`.

- `i` is 3 and remains unchanged.
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000 and remains unchanged.
- `offset` is `n` and remains unchanged.
- `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\) and remains unchanged.
- `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers equal to `new_dp` and remains unchanged except for the value at index `j + 1`.
- `j` is \(2 * n\) and remains unchanged.
- `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `offset` is `n`, `p` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(|p[i]| \leq n\), `dp` is a list of \(2n + 1\) integers equal to `new_dp`, `j` is \(2 * n\), and `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.**
