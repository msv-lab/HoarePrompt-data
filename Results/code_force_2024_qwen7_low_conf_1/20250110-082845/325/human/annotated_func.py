#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a binary string of length n consisting of only characters '0' and '1'. Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on the binary string using dynamic programming. Specifically, it updates a dynamic programming array \( dp \) where \( dp[i] \) represents the sum of distances from position \( i \) to the nearest '1' in the string \( s \). The function then appends the result of the sum of the first \( n \) elements of \( dp \) to a list of results. Finally, it prints each result in the list. The function ensures that the sum of \( n^2 \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 10^4 \).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the binary string \( s \) contains no '1's, the dynamic programming array \( dp \) will be updated correctly, but the sum will always be zero.
- The function handles the upper limit for \( n \) (100) and the total sum constraint for \( n^2 \) (not exceeding \( 10^4 \)).
- The function correctly processes multiple test cases and initializes the dynamic programming array for each test case appropriately.
