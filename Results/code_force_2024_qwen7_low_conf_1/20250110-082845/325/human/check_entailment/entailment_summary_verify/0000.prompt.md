You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on t and n . You can make hacks only if both
versions of the problem are solved.

For a binary^\dagger pattern p and a binary string q , both of length m , q is
called p -good if for every i (1 \leq i \leq m ), there exist indices l and r
such that:

  * 1 \leq l \leq i \leq r \leq m , and 
  * p_i is a mode^\ddagger of the string q_l q_{l+1} \ldots q_{r} . 

For a pattern p , let f(p) be the minimum possible number of \mathtt{1} s in a
p -good binary string (of the same length as the pattern).

You are given a binary string s of size n . Find

In other words, you need to sum the values of f over all \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
substrings of s .

^\dagger A binary pattern is a string that only consists of characters
\mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

^\ddagger Character c is a mode of string t of length m if the number of
occurrences of c in t is at least \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil . For example,
\mathtt{0} is a mode of \mathtt{010} , \mathtt{1} is not a mode of
\mathtt{010} , and both \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} are modes of \mathtt{011010}
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the binary string s .

The second line of each test case contains a binary string s of length n
consisting of only characters \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 10^4
.

Output

For each test case, output the sum of values of f over all substrings of s .

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    10
    
    5
    
    00000
    
    20
    
    11110110000000111111

Output

    1
    2
    0
    346
    
Note

In the first test case, the only \mathtt{1} -good string is \mathtt{1} . Thus,
f(\mathtt{1})=1 .

In the second test case, f(\mathtt{10})=1 because \mathtt{01} is \mathtt{10}
-good, and \mathtt{00} is not \mathtt{10} -good. Thus, the answer is
f(\mathtt{1})+f(\mathtt{10})+f(\mathtt{0}) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 .

In the third test case, f equals to 0 for all 1 \leq i \leq j \leq 5 . Thus,
the answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on the binary string using dynamic programming. Specifically, it updates a dynamic programming array \( dp \) where \( dp[i] \) represents the sum of distances from position \( i \) to the nearest '1' in the string \( s \). The function then appends the result of the sum of the first \( n \) elements of \( dp \) to a list of results. Finally, it prints each result in the list. The function ensures that the sum of \( n^2 \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 10^4 \).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the binary string \( s \) contains no '1's, the dynamic programming array \( dp \) will be updated correctly, but the sum will always be zero.
- The function handles the upper limit for \( n \) (100) and the total sum constraint for \( n^2 \) (not exceeding \( 10^4 \)).
- The function correctly processes multiple test cases and initializes the dynamic programming array for each test case appropriately.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not calculate the value of \( f(p) \) for each substring and sum these values as required. Instead, it seems to be attempting to calculate some form of dynamic programming solution, but it does not handle the core requirement of determining the minimum number of 1s in a p-good binary string for each substring.

To elaborate, the program reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases. It initializes a DP array `dp` to store intermediate results but does not properly compute the value of \( f(p) \) for each substring as defined in the problem. The logic within the loop does not reflect the actual computation needed to find the minimum number of 1s in a p-good string.

Here’s an example where the program would fail:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
110
```
The expected output would be the sum of \( f(\mathtt{110}) \), \( f(\mathtt{11}) \), and \( f(\mathtt{1}) \):
- \( f(\mathtt{110}) = 2 \) (since \(\mathtt{110}\) is p-good with 2 ones)
- \( f(\mathtt{11}) = 1 \) (since \(\mathtt{11}\) is p-good with 1 one)
- \( f(\mathtt{1}) = 1 \) (since \(\mathtt{1}\) is p-good with 1 one)

Thus, the total sum should be \( 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \).

However, the provided program does not perform this calculation correctly and will likely produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and hence is incorrect.
