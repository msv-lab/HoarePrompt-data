You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on t and n . You can make hacks only if both
versions of the problem are solved.

For a binary^\dagger pattern p and a binary string q , both of length m , q is
called p -good if for every i (1 \leq i \leq m ), there exist indices l and r
such that:

  * 1 \leq l \leq i \leq r \leq m , and 
  * p_i is a mode^\ddagger of the string q_l q_{l+1} \ldots q_{r} . 

For a pattern p , let f(p) be the minimum possible number of \mathtt{1} s in a
p -good binary string (of the same length as the pattern).

You are given a binary string s of size n . Find

In other words, you need to sum the values of f over all \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
substrings of s .

^\dagger A binary pattern is a string that only consists of characters
\mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

^\ddagger Character c is a mode of string t of length m if the number of
occurrences of c in t is at least \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil . For example,
\mathtt{0} is a mode of \mathtt{010} , \mathtt{1} is not a mode of
\mathtt{010} , and both \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} are modes of \mathtt{011010}
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the binary string s .

The second line of each test case contains a binary string s of length n
consisting of only characters \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 10^4
.

Output

For each test case, output the sum of values of f over all substrings of s .

Output

Note

In the first test case, the only \mathtt{1} -good string is \mathtt{1} . Thus,
f(\mathtt{1})=1 .

In the second test case, f(\mathtt{10})=1 because \mathtt{01} is \mathtt{10}
-good, and \mathtt{00} is not \mathtt{10} -good. Thus, the answer is
f(\mathtt{1})+f(\mathtt{10})+f(\mathtt{0}) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 .

In the third test case, f equals to 0 for all 1 \leq i \leq j \leq 5 . Thus,
the answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on the binary string using dynamic programming. Specifically, it updates a dynamic programming array \( dp \) where \( dp[i] \) represents the sum of distances from position \( i \) to the nearest '1' in the string \( s \). The function then appends the result of the sum of the first \( n \) elements of \( dp \) to a list of results. Finally, it prints each result in the list. The function ensures that the sum of \( n^2 \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 10^4 \).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the binary string \( s \) contains no '1's, the dynamic programming array \( dp \) will be updated correctly, but the sum will always be zero.
- The function handles the upper limit for \( n \) (100) and the total sum constraint for \( n^2 \) (not exceeding \( 10^4 \)).
- The function correctly processes multiple test cases and initializes the dynamic programming array for each test case appropriately.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to compute the sum of values of \( f(p) \) over all substrings of a given binary string \( s \), where \( f(p) \) is the minimum possible number of `1`s in a \( p \)-good binary string of the same length as the pattern \( p \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - It uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum number of `1`s required to make a substring `p`-good.
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store intermediate results.
   - For each position `i` in the string `s`, it calculates the minimum number of `1`s needed to form a `1`-good substring ending at `i`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - If the current character is `1`, then the value of `dp[i]` is calculated as \( n - i + dp[i + 1] \). This accounts for the fact that we need at least one `1` to make the substring `1`-good and then add the result of the next substring.
   - If the current character is `0`, then `dp[i]` is simply `dp[i + 1]`.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - After computing `dp` for each position, the sum of all values in `dp` up to the current length `n` is calculated and stored as the result for that substring.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles reading input and processing each test case.
   - The dynamic programming approach is sound for calculating the minimum number of `1`s required for each suffix of the string.
   - The final sum calculation is done correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.
