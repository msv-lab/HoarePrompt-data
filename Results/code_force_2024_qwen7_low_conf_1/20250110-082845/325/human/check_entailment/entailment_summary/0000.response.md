Reasoning:
The provided program appears to follow the steps necessary to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is likely correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads input correctly, splitting the data into the appropriate parts (number of cases, size of strings, and the strings themselves).

2. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: The program initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the sum of distances from each position to the nearest '1'. This is done correctly with the backward iteration to ensure the nearest '1' is found.

3. **Updating DP Array**: The program updates the `dp` array correctly. If the current character is '1', it sets `dp[i]` to `n - i + dp[i + 1]`, ensuring that the distance to the nearest '1' is added to the next value. Otherwise, it simply copies the value from the next position.

4. **Calculating Result**: The program sums the first `n` elements of the `dp` array to get the result for each substring and appends this result to a list.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases by looping through each one and processing them independently.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles strings without any '1's, resulting in a sum of 0 for such cases.

7. **Constraints**: The program respects the constraints specified, including the upper limit for \( n \) (100) and the total sum constraint for \( n^2 \) (not exceeding \( 10^4 \)).

Given these points, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
