`result` is appended to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, so it remains unchanged. The value of `dp` and `n` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `dp` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `results` is now a list containing the original `result`.
Output State: **`result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `dp` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `results` is [sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`]**
