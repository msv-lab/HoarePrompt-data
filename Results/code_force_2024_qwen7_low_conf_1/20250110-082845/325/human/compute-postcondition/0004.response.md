The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `data`, and `num_cases` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of only characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `index` is 1, `num_cases` is the integer value of `data[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of only characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `index` is 1, `num_cases` is the integer value of `data[0]`**
