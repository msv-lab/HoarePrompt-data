`s` is assigned the value of `data[index]`. Given that `index` is 2, this means `s` is now the third element in the list `data` converted to a string. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is the second element in the list `data` converted to an integer, `s` is the third element in the list `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace that must contain at least one element, `index` is 2, `num_cases` must be a positive integer, `results` is an empty list**
