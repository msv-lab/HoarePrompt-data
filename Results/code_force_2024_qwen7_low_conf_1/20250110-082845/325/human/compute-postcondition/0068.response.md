The code sets `dp[i]` to `n - i + dp[i + 1]`. Given the initial state where `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros and `i` is `n - 2`, we know the following:

- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, meaning every element in `dp` is 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.

Since `dp[i + 1]` refers to the element at index `i + 1` in the list `dp`, and given that `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1`. So, `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[n - 1]`, which is 0 (as all elements in `dp` are initially set to 0).

Thus, `dp[i]` is updated to `n - i + dp[i + 1]` which translates to `dp[n - 2] = n - (n - 2) + 0`. This simplifies to `dp[n - 2] = 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[n - 2]` being 2, `i` is `n - 2`**
