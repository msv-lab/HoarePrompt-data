The code snippet `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, this means that the value of `dp[i]` will now be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1]`. The other variables (`s`, `i`, and `dp[0]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i`, `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[i + 1]`, and `dp[0]` is determined as follows: if the character at index `i` of `s` is '1', then `dp[0]` is `n - i + dp[0]`; otherwise, `dp[0]` is equal to `dp[1]`.**
