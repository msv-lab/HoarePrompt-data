The code snippet `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, the only known value of `dp` is that `dp[n - 2]` is 2 if `s[i - 1] == '1'`, and otherwise `dp[i - 1]` is 0. However, without a specific value for `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of `dp[i + 1]` for other indices. 

Since no specific value of `i` is given, we can only say that `dp[i]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1]`. The other parts of the precondition remain unchanged.

Output State: **`result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, if `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `dp[n - 2]` is 2, otherwise `dp[i - 1]` is 0, and `dp[i]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1]`.**
