Output State: **`num_cases` is a non-negative integer - 1, `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10`, `result` is the sum of all elements in `dp`, `i` is -1, `length` is a positive integer.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Values and Loop Execution:**
   - Initially, `i` is -1, indicating the loop has ended.
   - `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` where each element is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `result` starts at 0 and is incremented by each element in `dp` during the loop execution.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `dp` and adds its value to `result`.
   - Since `i` starts at -1 and the loop increments `i` (though not explicitly shown, the loop implicitly iterates through each index of `dp`), `i` effectively ranges from `length - 1` to 0.
   - For each index `i`, the value of `dp[i]` is determined based on the characters in `input_string`:
     - If `input_string[i]` is '1', then `dp[i] = length - i + dp[i + 3]`.
     - If `input_string[i]` is '0', then `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After the loop finishes, `result` will be the sum of all elements in `dp`.
   - `i` will be -1, indicating the loop has completed.
   - `dp` retains its final values based on the input string.
   - `num_cases` remains unchanged as it was already a non-negative integer - 1.
   - `input_string` remains unchanged as it is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `length` remains a positive integer.

4. **Summation of `dp`:**
   - Since the loop sums up all elements in `dp`, `result` will be the sum of all values in `dp`.

5. **Non-execution Case:**
   - If the loop does not execute (which would be the case if `length` is 0), then `dp` would still be initialized as a list of length `length + 10`, and `result` would be 0 since no additions are made to it.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop is captured as:
Output State: **`num_cases` is a non-negative integer - 1, `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10`, `result` is the sum of all elements in `dp`, `i` is -1, `length` is a positive integer.**
