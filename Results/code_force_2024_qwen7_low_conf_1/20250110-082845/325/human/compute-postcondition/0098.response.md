The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will process multiple test cases internally, where for each test case, it accepts the following:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). This represents the length of the binary string.
- For each test case, `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.

The function processes these test cases and does not return a direct result from the parameters but rather from the internal logic based on `t`, `n`, and `s`.

Given the described behavior, the function will handle multiple test cases with varying `t`, `n`, and `s` values.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases internally where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the binary string), and a binary string `s` of length `n`.**
