The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1]` to `dp[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 2`, so `dp[i]` becomes `dp[n - 2 + 1]`, which simplifies to `dp[n - 1]`. The value of `dp[n - 1]` is originally 0, as all elements in `dp` are initialized to 0. Therefore, `dp[i]` (which is `dp[n - 1]`) is now also 0.

The states of other variables (`result`, `dp`, and `i`) are not changed directly by this operation, except for the updated value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`, `dp[i]` is 0**
