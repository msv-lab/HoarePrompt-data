Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is a string.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` that has been updated according to some rules.
   - `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`.
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `result`.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(num_cases):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates `num_cases` times.
   - At the end of the previous iteration (which means it has already completed one full cycle), `i` is 0, meaning it is ready to start the next iteration.
   - Since `_` is used as a placeholder for the iterator variable, it doesn't directly affect the state of the variables mentioned.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the only thing that changes is the iteration count. Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be set to 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`s`, `dp`, `result`, `results`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to these variables within the loop itself.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `s` remains a string.
   - `dp` remains a list of length `n + 1` that has been updated according to the rules.
   - `result` remains the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`.
   - `results` remains a list containing the value of `result`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a string, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` updated according to the rules specified, `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`**.
