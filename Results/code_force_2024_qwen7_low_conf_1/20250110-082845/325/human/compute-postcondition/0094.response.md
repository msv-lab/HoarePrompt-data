The code `result += i` increments the value of `result` by the value of `i`. Given that `i` is now `length - 1`, we can substitute this value into the expression for `result`.

From the initial state:
- `result` is \((length - 1) + (length - 2)\)
- `i` is now `length - 1`

Therefore, the new value of `result` is:
\[ result = (length - 1) + (length - 2) + (length - 1) \]
Simplifying the expression:
\[ result = 3(length - 1) - 2 \]

So, the updated values are:
- `result` is \(3(length - 1) - 2\)
- `i` is `length - 1`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_cases` remains unchanged as it was already a non-negative integer - 1, `input_string` remains unchanged as it is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `dp` remains a list of length `length + 10`, `result` is \(3(length - 1) - 2\), `i` is `length - 1`, and `length` remains a positive integer.**
