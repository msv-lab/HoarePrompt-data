Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Initial State**: 
   - `num_cases` is the number of test cases.
   - `results` is a non-empty list.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` that has been updated according to certain rules.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` for each test case.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` for each test case.
   - `index` is `num_cases * 2 + 1`.
   - `res` has been printed.

2. **Analyze the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one element remaining.
   - Since `results` is a non-empty list initially, it will continue to be non-empty until all elements are processed.
   - After the loop body is executed for the current element in `results`, the next element in `results` becomes the current element for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `num_cases` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `results` is reduced by one element after each iteration since one element is processed per iteration.
   - `dp`, `s`, `n`, and `index` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the loop.
   - `res` is printed for each iteration, so its value is not relevant for determining the continuation of the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that one element has been removed from `results`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_cases` is the number of test cases, `results` is a non-empty list with one element less, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` updated according to the rules specified, `s` is a string of length `n` for each test case, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` for each test case, `index` is `num_cases * 2 + 1`**.
