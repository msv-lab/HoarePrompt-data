`num_cases` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. Given that `index` is 0, `num_cases` is set to the integer value of the first element in the list `data`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of only characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `index` is 0, and `num_cases` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
