Output State: **`num_cases` is a non-negative integer - 1, `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` where `dp[0]` to `dp[length + 9]` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `result` is 0, `i` is -1 (after the loop ends), `length` is a positive integer from the input, `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `dp` is populated according to the following rules:
- For each position `i` in `input_string` (from `length - 1` to `0`), if `input_string[i]` is '1', then `dp[i]` is calculated as `length - i + dp[i + 3]`.
- If `input_string[i]` is '0', then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i + 1]`.

The final state of `dp` contains the computed values based on the entire string `input_string`.**
