Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is 0, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is determined as follows: if the character at index `i` of `s` is '1', then `dp[i]` is `n - i + dp[i + 1]`; otherwise, `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[i + 1]`. The final state of `dp` is such that `dp[0]` contains the sum of all elements in `dp` starting from `dp[1]` and adding `n - i` for each '1' encountered from the end of the string `s` to the beginning.**

Explanation:
1. **Initial Setup**: The loop iterates in reverse from `n - 1` down to `0`. For each iteration, `dp[i]` is updated based on the condition of whether the character at index `i` in `s` is '1'.
2. **First Iteration (i = n - 1)**: If `s[n-1] == '1'`, then `dp[n-1] = n - (n-1) + dp[n] = 1 + 0 = 1`. Otherwise, `dp[n-1] = dp[n] = 0`.
3. **Subsequent Iterations**: Each subsequent iteration updates `dp[i]` based on the value of `dp[i+1]` and the condition of the character at index `i` in `s`. This process continues until `i = 0`.
4. **Final State**: After the loop completes, `dp[0]` will contain the sum of all elements in `dp` starting from `dp[1]` and adding `n - i` for each '1' encountered from the end of the string `s` to the beginning. This is because each `dp[i]` is effectively carrying forward the sum of all subsequent elements in `dp` and adding `n - i` when the character is '1'.
