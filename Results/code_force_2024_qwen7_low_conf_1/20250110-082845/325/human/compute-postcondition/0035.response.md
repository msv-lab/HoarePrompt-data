The code initializes the `dp` list with zeros, meaning each element in `dp` is set to 0. The length of `dp` is `n + 1`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`i`, `s`, `result`, `results`, `index`). 

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as follows:
- `i` is 1
- `s` is `data[index]` where `index` is 2, so `s` is `data[2]`
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0
- `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, which is 0 since all elements are 0
- `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, so `results` is `[0]`
- `index` is 2

Output State: **`i` is 1; `s` is `data[2]`; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0; `result` is 0; `results` is `[0]`; `index` is 2**
