Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is `data[2]`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 (except possibly `dp[n - 1]` which might be 1), `result` is 0, `results` is `[0]`, `index` is 2. If `s[i] == '1'`, then `dp[n - 2]` is set to 3 and `dp[n - 1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[n - 2]` remains unchanged as 0.***
