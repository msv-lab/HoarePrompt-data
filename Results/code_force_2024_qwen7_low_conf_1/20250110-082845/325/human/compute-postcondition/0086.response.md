The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems that the function should process a series of test cases, where each test case includes three elements: an integer `t` (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer `n` (such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a binary string `s` of length `n` consisting of only characters '0' and '1'. The function's output is not specified directly but rather implied by the input constraints.

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, we will focus on the input parameters and their constraints.

The functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a binary string `s` of length `n` consisting of only characters '0' and '1'.
