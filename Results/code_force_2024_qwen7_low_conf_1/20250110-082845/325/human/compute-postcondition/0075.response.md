Output State: **`result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, where each element `dp[i]` is the length of the longest substring starting from index `i` that consists only of '1's.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the string `s` from right to left, updating the `dp` array.
- For each position `i`, if `s[i]` is '1', then `dp[i]` is set to `n - i + dp[i + 1]`. This means that `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest substring of '1's starting from index `i`.
- If `s[i]` is '0', then `dp[i]` remains the same as `dp[i + 1]`, indicating that the longest substring ending at `i` is the same as the one ending at `i + 1`.

Since the loop processes each character of `s` exactly once, the final state of `dp` will reflect the length of the longest substring of '1's starting from each index in `s`. The `result` remains 0 because no operation modifies it other than the initial assignment.

Thus, the final output state is that `result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and each element `dp[i]` indicates the length of the longest substring of '1's starting from index `i` in the string `s`.
