The code appends the value of `result` (which is 0) to the `results` list. Since `results` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a new list being initialized here. The value of `result` remains unchanged at 0, and the `dp` list stays as a list of `n + 1` zeros.

Output State: **`result` is 0; `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `results` is a list containing 0**
