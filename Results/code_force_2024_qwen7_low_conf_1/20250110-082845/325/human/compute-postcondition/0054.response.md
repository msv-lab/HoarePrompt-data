Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`.
   - `dp` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `results` is a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(num_cases):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop uses `range(num_cases)` to iterate.
   - The variable `_` is used as a placeholder for the loop variable since it's not actually used within the loop body (as indicated by the comment `# the loop body is omitted`).

4. **State Changes**:
   - Since the loop body is not provided and `_` is a placeholder, no changes are made to the variables `result`, `dp`, or `n` inside the loop.
   - Therefore, the state remains the same at the start of each iteration.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment the number of iterations.
   - Initially, if `num_cases` is set to some value, say `k`, then after one iteration, `num_cases` would be decremented by 1 (assuming the loop decrements `num_cases` by 1 each time it runs).

6. **Adjusted States**:
   - `result` remains the same.
   - `dp` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `results` remains a list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`.
   - `num_cases` is decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `dp` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `results` is [sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`], `num_cases` is decremented by 1**
