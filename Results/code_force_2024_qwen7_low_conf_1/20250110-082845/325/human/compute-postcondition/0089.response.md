Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the loop control variable**: The loop control variable `i` is initialized to `-1` after the loop ends. This means that before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to `length - 1` because the loop iterates over elements of `dp` in reverse order from `length - 1` to `0`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs while `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, before entering the loop, `i` must be initialized to `length - 1`, and `length` must be a positive integer.

3. **Loop body dependencies**: Inside the loop, the value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the character `input_string[i]`. To determine the initial state of `dp`, we need to consider the initialization and update rules given.

4. **Initial state of `dp`**: Since `dp` is a list of length `length + 10`, and it is populated based on the conditions inside the loop, we need to ensure that `dp` is properly initialized before the loop starts. However, the specific values of `dp` are determined by the loop, so we don't need to explicitly adjust these values unless they are given some special initialization.

5. **Other relevant states**: The other relevant states are `input_string`, `length`, and `result`. `input_string` is already in a correct form (stripped of leading and trailing whitespace), and `result` is not directly involved in the loop but might be used outside the loop, so it doesn't need adjustment.

Given this analysis, the key adjustments needed for the loop to execute are ensuring `i` is correctly initialized and `length` is a positive integer.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num_cases` is a non-negative integer - 1, `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10`, `result` is 0, `i` is `length - 1` (before the loop starts), `length` is a positive integer, `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing with the correct initial state for the loop variable `i`.
