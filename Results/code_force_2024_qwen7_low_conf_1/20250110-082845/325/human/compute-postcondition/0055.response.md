`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is converted to an integer, and this integer value is assigned to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `dp` remains unchanged, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is [sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`], `num_cases` is decremented by 1.
