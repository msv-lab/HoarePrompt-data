Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(num_cases):`, which means the loop will run `num_cases` times.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `s` is a binary string of length `n`.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace.
   - `index` is 1.
   - `num_cases` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `num_cases` must be a positive integer. This is because the loop iterates `num_cases` times.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - `num_cases` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute. Since `num_cases` is derived from `data[0]`, we need to ensure that `data[0]` is a valid positive integer.
   - `index` is 1, which means the loop will start processing from the second element of `data` (since indexing starts from 0).

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `num_cases` must be a positive integer.
- `data` must be a list containing at least one element (so that `data[0]` is defined and can be converted to an integer).

Therefore, the final state required for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace that must contain at least one element, `index` is 1, `num_cases` must be a positive integer, `results` is an empty list**.
