The code sets `dp[i]` to `n - i + dp[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 1`, and `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. Since `dp` is initialized to all zeros, `dp[i + 1]` (which is `dp[n]`) is 0. So, `dp[i]` (which is `dp[n - 1]`) is set to `n - (n - 1) + 0`, which simplifies to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `dp[n - 1]` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `s[i]` is '1'**
