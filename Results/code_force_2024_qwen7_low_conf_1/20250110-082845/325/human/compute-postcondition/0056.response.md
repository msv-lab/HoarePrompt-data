`index` is incremented by 1, which means the new value of `index` is `data[index] + 1`. The values of `result`, `dp`, `n`, `results`, and `num_cases` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `dp` remains unchanged, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is [sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`], `num_cases` is decremented by 1, `index` is `data[index] + 1`**
