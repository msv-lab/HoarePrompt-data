Let's break down the given state and the for loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `result` is 0
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
- `n` is `int(data[index])`
- `results` is `[0]`
- `num_cases` is decremented by 1
- `index` is `data[index] + 2`
- `s` is `data[index]`

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `n`:**
   - The value of `n` is determined by `n = int(data[index])`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (since the range starts from `n - 1` and goes down to `-1`).

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop variable `i` will take values from `n - 1` down to `0`.
   - Therefore, before entering the loop, `i` must be initialized to `n - 1`.

3. **List `dp`:**
   - `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - This list is already defined and populated with zeros.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `result`, `results`, `num_cases`, `index`, and `s` are not directly used in the loop itself but might be modified inside the loop.
   - Since we are only concerned with the initial state needed for the loop to execute, these variables don't need to be explicitly adjusted here.

### Conclusion:

The critical states that need adjustment for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be a positive integer.
- `i` must be initialized to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the required state modification is:
**`result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`**.

State: **`result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`**.
