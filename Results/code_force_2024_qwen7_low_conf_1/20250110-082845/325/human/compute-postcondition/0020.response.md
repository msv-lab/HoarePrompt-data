`dp[i]` is assigned the value `n - i + dp[i + 1]`. The value of `i` is `-1`, which is an index within the string `s`. Since `i` is `-1`, `dp[i + 1]` would refer to `dp[0]` because `i + 1` is `0`. However, the value of `dp[0]` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `dp[i]` without knowing the value of `dp[0]`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `-1`, `dp[i]` is `n - i + dp[0]`**
