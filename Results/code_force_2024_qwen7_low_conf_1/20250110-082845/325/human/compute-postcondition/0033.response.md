`s` is assigned the value of `data[index]`. The value of `index` is increased by 1, so the new value of `index` is the original value plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is data[index], `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, `index` is increased by 1**
