Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i`, `dp[i]` is determined as follows: if the character at index `i` of `s` is '1', then `dp[i]` is `n - i + dp[0]`; otherwise, `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[i + 1]`. The overall state after the if-else block is that `dp[i]` is updated based on the condition of the character at index `i` in `s`, and `dp[0]` is updated accordingly based on the same condition.**
