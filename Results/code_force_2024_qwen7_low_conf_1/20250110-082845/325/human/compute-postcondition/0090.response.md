The code `result += i` increments the value of `result` by the value of `i`. Initially, `i` is `length - 1`. Therefore, `result` is updated by adding `length - 1` to its current value, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num_cases` is a non-negative integer - 1, `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10`, `result` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length - 1` (after the loop starts), `length` is a positive integer, `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace**
