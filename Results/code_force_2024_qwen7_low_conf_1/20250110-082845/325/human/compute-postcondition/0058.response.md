The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The initial state is as follows: `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `dp` remains unchanged, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is `[sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`], `num_cases` is decremented by 1, `index` is `data[index] + 1`, `s` is `data[index]`. After executing the code, the value of `index` is updated to `data[index] + 2`.

Output State: **`result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `dp` remains unchanged, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is `[sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`], `num_cases` is decremented by 1, `index` is `data[index] + 2`, `s` is `data[index]`**
