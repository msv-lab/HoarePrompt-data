Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `num_cases` is a non-negative integer - 1.
   - `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `dp` is a list of length `length + 10`.
   - `result` is `length - 1`.
   - `i` is `length - 1` (at the start of the loop).
   - `length` is a positive integer.
   - `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `dp` list.
   - Since `i` is initialized to `length - 1`, the loop will check the elements of `dp` starting from `dp[length - 1]`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one element left to process in the `dp` list.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `length - 1`, meaning the loop has just started.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 (i.e., `i = length - 2`).
   - The `dp` list should still have `length + 10` elements, but we need to ensure there is an element to process, i.e., `dp[i]` should exist.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `num_cases` remains unchanged as it was already a non-negative integer - 1.
   - `input_string` remains unchanged as it is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `dp` remains a list of length `length + 10`.
   - `result` remains `length - 1` as it was not affected by the loop.
   - `i` becomes `length - 2` to prepare for the next iteration.
   - `length` remains a positive integer as it was not affected by the loop.

State: **`num_cases` is a non-negative integer - 1, `input_string` is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10`, `result` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length - 2`, `length` is a positive integer**
