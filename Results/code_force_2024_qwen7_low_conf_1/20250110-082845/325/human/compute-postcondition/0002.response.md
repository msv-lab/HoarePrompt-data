The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, or `data`. Therefore, the only change is that `index` is now set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of only characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `index` is 0**.
