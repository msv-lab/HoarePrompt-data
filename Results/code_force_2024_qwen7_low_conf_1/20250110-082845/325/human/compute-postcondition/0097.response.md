Output State: **`num_cases` is a positive integer, `length` is the maximum length of `input_string` across all cases, `input_string` is the last user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `dp` is a list of length `length + 10` with the final accumulated values based on the characters in each `input_string`, `result` is the sum of all elements in `dp`, `i` is -1, and the value of `result` is printed using `Decimal(result)`**.

### Explanation:
- **`num_cases`**: This remains a positive integer indicating the number of test cases.
- **`length`**: This is the maximum length of any `input_string` across all cases. Initially, it starts as the length of the first `input_string`, but it updates with each new `input_string` that is longer.
- **`input_string`**: This is the last user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. The value of `input_string` changes with each iteration of the outer loop.
- **`dp`**: This is a list of length `length + 10` where each element is updated based on the characters in the `input_string`. After all iterations, `dp` contains the final accumulated values.
- **`result`**: This is the sum of all elements in `dp` after processing all `input_strings`. It accumulates the values from `dp` during each iteration.
- **`i`**: This is the index used in the inner loop, starting from `length - 1` down to `-1`. By the end of all iterations, `i` will be `-1`.
- **Printing**: The final value of `result` is printed using `Decimal(result)`.

This state reflects the final values of the variables after all iterations of the loops have completed, taking into account the dependencies and changes introduced by the loop iterations.
