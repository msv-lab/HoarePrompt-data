The code sets `result` to 0, which was previously initialized to 0 in the initial state. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `result` is now 0.
- `dp` remains `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (a list of `n + 1` zeros).
- `n` remains `int(data[index])`.
- `results` remains `[0]`.
- `num_cases` is decremented by 1.
- `index` remains `data[index] + 2`.
- `s` remains `data[index]`.

Output State: **`result` is 0, `dp` is `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (a list of `n + 1` zeros), `n` is `int(data[index])`, `results` is `[0]`, `num_cases` is decremented by 1, `index` is `data[index] + 2`, `s` is `data[index]`.**
