The code initializes a list `dp` with zeros, where the length of the list is `n + 1`. The value of `n` is the second element in the list `data` converted to an integer. The list `dp` is created with this length, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is the second element in the list `data` converted to an integer, `s` is the third element in the list `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `index` is 3, `num_cases` must be a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**
