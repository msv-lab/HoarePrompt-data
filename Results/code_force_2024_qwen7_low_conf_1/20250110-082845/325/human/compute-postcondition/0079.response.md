To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `num_cases`: The number of test cases.
- `results`: A list containing the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` for each test case.
- `dp`: A list of length `n + 1` updated according to specified rules.
- `s`: A string of length `n` for each test case.
- `n`: An integer value from the `data` list, specifically `data[index]` where `index = num_cases * 2 + 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for res in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that the `results` list has at least one element before the loop starts.

### Required Adjustments:
- The `results` list must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- Since the `results` list is derived from the test cases, and we know there are `num_cases` test cases, we need to ensure that each test case produces a valid `results` entry.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the `results` list must have at least one element.

State: **`num_cases` is the number of test cases, `results` is a non-empty list (must have at least one element), `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` updated according to the rules specified, `s` is a string of length `n` for each test case, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` for each test case, `index` is `num_cases * 2 + 1`.**
