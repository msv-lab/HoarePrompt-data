`data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the variable `s` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of only characters '0' and '1', and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace.
