Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is `data[2]`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except possibly `dp[n - 3]` which might be 3, `result` is `0`, `results` is `[0]`, `index` is `2`. If `s[i] == '1'`, then `dp[n - 3]` is set to `3`. Otherwise, `dp[n - 3]` is set to `dp[n - 2]`.***
