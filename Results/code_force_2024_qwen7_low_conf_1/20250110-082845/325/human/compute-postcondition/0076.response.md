The code calculates the sum of the first `n` elements in the list `dp` and assigns it to `result`. Since the initial state of `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp` will also be zero because each element in `dp` is zero.

- `result` is initially set to 0.
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- After executing `result = sum(dp[:n])`, `result` will be the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, which is 0.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**
