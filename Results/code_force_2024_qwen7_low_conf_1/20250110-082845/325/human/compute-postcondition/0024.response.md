The code snippet `dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1]`. The previous value of `dp[i]` depends on whether the character at index `i` in `s` is '1' or not, but the exact value of `dp[i]` is now defined by the new equation.

Let's analyze the impact:

- `dp[i]` is updated to `n - i + dp[i + 1]`.
- The value of `s` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `dp[i + 1]` is used in the calculation, implying that the value of `dp[i + 1]` remains as per its previous definition.

Since the value of `dp[i]` is now defined by the new equation, and we don't have the exact initial value of `dp[i]` or `dp[i + 1]`, we can express `dp[i]` in terms of `n`, `i`, and `dp[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i`, `dp[i]` is `n - i + dp[i + 1]`, and `dp[i + 1]` remains as per its previous definition.**
