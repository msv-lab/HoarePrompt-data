Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `result` is 0
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- If `s[i] == '1'`, then `dp[n - 2]` is 2. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains 0.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches -1.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `result` is 0.
   - `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
   - If `s[i] == '1'`, then `dp[n - 2]` is 2. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains 0.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the next value of `i` will be `i - 1`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `result` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the problem does not specify any modification of `result` inside the loop, it stays at 0.
   - `dp` list needs to be adjusted based on the current value of `i`.
   - If `s[i] == '1'`, then `dp[n - 2]` should be updated to 2. Otherwise, `dp[i]` should remain 0.

6. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be `i - 1` from the previous value.
   - `dp` will be adjusted according to the condition mentioned above.

### Final State:
- `result` is still 0.
- `dp` list will be adjusted based on the new value of `i` (which is `i - 1`).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, if `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `dp[n - 2]` is 2. Otherwise, `dp[i - 1]` remains 0.**
