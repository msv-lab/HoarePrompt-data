`results.append(result)` appends the current value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `s` is a string, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` updated according to the rules specified, `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, and the list `results` contains the appended value of `result`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a string, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` updated according to the rules specified, `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`.**
