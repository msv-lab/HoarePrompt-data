The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1'. However, the value of `n` and the current value of `dp[i + 1]` are not specified in the initial state.

Given this, the only variable that is directly impacted by the code is `dp[i]`. The value of `dp[i]` is now calculated as `n - i + dp[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1'; `dp[i]` is `n - i + dp[i + 1]`**
