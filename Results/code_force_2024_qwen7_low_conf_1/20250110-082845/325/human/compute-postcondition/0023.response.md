Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is `i - 1` (This means `i` was decremented by 1 from its value in the previous iteration).
   - `dp[i]` is determined based on the character at index `i` of `s`:
     - If the character at index `i` of `s` is '1', then `dp[i]` is `n - i + dp[0]`.
     - Otherwise, `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[i + 1]`.

2. **Loop Control Variable**: The loop is defined as:
   ```
   for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 1`.

4. **Current Value of `i`**: Since `i` is decremented by 1 from its previous value, we need to determine what the new value of `i` should be for the next iteration.

5. **Determine New `i` Value**: To find the new value of `i` for the next iteration, we add 1 to the current value of `i`. 

6. **Determine New `dp[i]` Value**: The value of `dp[i]` will be determined based on the character at index `i` of `s` in the next iteration.

Putting it all together:

- The current value of `i` is `i - 1` (from the previous state).
- For the next iteration, `i` will be `i - 1 + 1 = i`.

- The character at index `i` of `s` will determine the value of `dp[i]`:
  - If `s[i]` is '1', then `dp[i]` will be `n - i + dp[0]`.
  - Otherwise, `dp[i]` will be `dp[i + 1]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `s` remains the same string.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i`.
- `dp[i]` is determined based on the condition mentioned above.

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i`, and `dp[i]` is determined as follows: if the character at index `i` of `s` is '1', then `dp[i]` is `n - i + dp[0]`; otherwise, `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[i + 1]`.**
