According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse from `n-1` down to `0`. The loop condition is based on the variable `i`, which decreases by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `result` is 0
- `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
- If `s[i]` is '1', then `dp[n - 1]` is 1. Otherwise, `dp[n - 1]` remains 0.

Let's analyze the loop and determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Initial State**: The loop starts with `i` as `n-1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.
2. **Previous Iteration**: Assume we are at the start of the next iteration, which means `i` was `n-2` in the previous iteration.
3. **Next Iteration**: In the next iteration, `i` will be `n-3`.

The key here is to understand how the loop variable `i` changes and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue.

Given that the loop starts at `n-1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n-2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `i` being decreased by 1, making it `n-2`.

Since no other variables or conditions are specified to change within this loop iteration (like `result` or the contents of `dp`), these remain as stated.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`result` is 0, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is `n - 2`**
