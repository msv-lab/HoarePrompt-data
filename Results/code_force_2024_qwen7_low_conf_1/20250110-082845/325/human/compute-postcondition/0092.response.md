The code `result += i` increments the value of `result` by the current value of `i`. According to the initial state, `i` becomes `length - 2` to prepare for the next iteration, and `length` remains a positive integer. Therefore, `result` is updated by adding `length - 2` to its previous value, which was `length - 1`.

Output State: **`num_cases` remains unchanged as it was already a non-negative integer - 1, `input_string` remains unchanged as it is the user's input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `dp` remains a list of length `length + 10`, `result` is now `(length - 1) + (length - 2)`, `i` is now `length - 2`, and `length` remains a positive integer.**
