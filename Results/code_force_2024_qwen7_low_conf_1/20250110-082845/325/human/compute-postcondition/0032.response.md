`index` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `index` is not specified in the initial state. Since no specific value for `index` is given, we can only say that `index` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a string, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`, `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, `index` is increased by 1**
