Precondition: **N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N, M are odd. P is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10. T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. The field is represented as a list of N strings, where each string contains M characters. Each pair of characters in the field can be one of the following: '..', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'. There is exactly one '.Q' and at most one '.B' in the field. The input also includes a series of T actions, each described by a pair of characters representing the entity performing the action, followed by details of the action (U, D, L, R, C, or T).**
