`red_score` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `N - 1`, `M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]` for all iterations of the loop, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, `bludger` is the position of the bludger within `field` (or `None` if no bludger), `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value in `field` except 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B', and '.', and each value is a dictionary containing the player's position and whether they have the quaffle, `goals` is a dictionary with keys 'RG' and 'BG', `red_score` is incremented by 1, `blue_score` remains unchanged, `events` is a list containing the event corresponding to the goal type (either `'t RED GOAL'` or `'t BLUE GOAL'`), `entity` is the first element of the list `action`, `command` is 'T', `x` is the x-coordinate of the player's position, `y` is the y-coordinate of the player's position, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
