Based on the given code snippet and initial state:

1. The initial state specifies that `M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, and depending on the value of `cell`, certain actions are taken:
   - If `cell` is in `('RG', 'BG')`, then `goals[cell]` includes the tuple `(i, previous_j + 1)`.
   - If `cell` is equal to `.Q`, then `quaffle` is set to `(i, previous_j + 1)`.
   - If `cell` is equal to `.B`, then `bludger` is set to `(i, previous_j + 1)`.
   - Otherwise, `cell` is not equal to `'.'`, and `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos': (i, previous_j + 1)` and `'has_quaffle': False`.

2. The code snippet `goals[cell].append((i, j))` appends the tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`.

Given this, we need to update the state of `goals[cell]`. Since the initial state does not specify what `goals[cell]` is before this operation, we assume it was an empty list (the default value for a list when it is accessed). After appending `(i, j)`, `goals[cell]` will now contain `[ (i, j) ]`.

Output State: **`M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, if `cell` is in (`'RG', 'BG'`), then `goals[cell]` is now `[ (i, j) ]`, if `cell` is equal to `.Q`, then `quaffle` is set to `(i, previous_j + 1)`, if `cell` is equal to `.B`, then `bludger` is set to `(i, previous_j + 1)`, otherwise, `cell` is not equal to `'.'`, and `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos': (i, previous_j + 1)` and `'has_quaffle': False`.**
