The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variable `quaffle`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is not specified but derived from the condition that `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]` and currently is `.Q`, it means `j` must be 0 as well. 

Therefore, the variable `quaffle` is now `(0, 0)`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'), `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`, and the current value of `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is (0, 0)**
