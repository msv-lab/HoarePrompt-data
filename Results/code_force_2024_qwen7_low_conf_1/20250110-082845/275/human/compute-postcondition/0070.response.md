`goals[cell]` is appended with the tuple `(i, j)`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the tuple `(1, 1)` is added to `goals[cell]`. The values of `M`, `field[1][1]`, and `cell` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 1 and the value of `j` remains 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `cell` is the value of `field[1][1]`, `goals[cell]` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`**
