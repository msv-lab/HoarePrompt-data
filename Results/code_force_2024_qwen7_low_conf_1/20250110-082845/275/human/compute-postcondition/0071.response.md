The code assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the value of `quaffle` becomes `(1, 1)`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `M`, `j`, and `cell`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `M` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `cell` is the value of `field[1][1]`, and `quaffle` is `(1, 1)`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `cell` is the value of `field[1][1]`, `quaffle` is (1, 1)**
