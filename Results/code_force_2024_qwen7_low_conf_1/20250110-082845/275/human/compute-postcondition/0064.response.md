Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `cell` is the value of `field[1][0]`, `quaffle` is a tuple indicating the position of the quaffle within `field` (or None if no quaffle), `bludger` is a tuple indicating the position of the bludger within `field` (or None if no bludger), `players['field[1][0]']` is a dictionary with keys `'pos'` and `'has_quaffle'`, where `'pos'` is `(1, 0)` and `'has_quaffle'` is `False`, `goals` is a dictionary with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'`, each containing a list of tuples representing the positions where goals were scored. If `cell` is not equal to `'..',` the player at position `(1, 0)` remains with `has_quaffle` as `False`. If `cell` is `'..',` no change occurs in the state of the players or other variables.***
