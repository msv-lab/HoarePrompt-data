Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`. If `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` respectively includes the tuple `(0, j)`. If `cell` is '.Q', then `quaffle` is (0, 0). If `cell` is '.B', then `bludger` is (0, j). In all other cases, `players[cell]` is {'pos': (0, j), 'has_quaffle': False}.***
