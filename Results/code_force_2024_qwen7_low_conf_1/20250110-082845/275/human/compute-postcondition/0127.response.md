Output State: **`M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]` for all iterations of the loop. If `cell` is in (`'RG', 'BG'`), then `goals[cell]` contains tuples `(i, j)` for all positions where `cell` was `'RG'` or `'BG'`. If `cell` is `.Q`, then `quaffle` is `(i, j)` where `cell` was `.Q`. If `cell` is `.B`, then `bludger` is `(i, j)` where `cell` was `.B`. For any other `cell`, `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos': (i, j)` and `'has_quaffle': False` for all positions where `cell` matches the key.**
