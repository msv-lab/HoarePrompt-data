Postcondition: **`i` is 0 and `M` is greater than 0; `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`; if `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` includes the tuples `(0, j + 2)`, `(0, j + 1)`, and `(i, j)`; if `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is updated to `(i, j)` if the condition in the if block is true, otherwise it remains `(0, 0)`; if `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is updated to `(0, j + 2)` if the condition in the if block is false, otherwise it remains `(0, j + 2)` or updates to `(i, j)` depending on the condition inside the if block; in all other cases, `players[cell]` is updated to `{'pos': (0, j + 2), 'has_quaffle': False, 'goals': [(0, j + 1)]}`.**
