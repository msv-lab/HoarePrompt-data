`bludger` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. The values of `M` and `cell` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `bludger` is `(i, j)`.

Output State: **`M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `bludger` is `(i, j)`**
