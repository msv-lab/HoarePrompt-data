The code assigns the value of `field[i][j]` to the variable `cell`. Initially, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, so `cell` is assigned the value of `field[1][1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `cell` is the value of `field[1][1]`**
