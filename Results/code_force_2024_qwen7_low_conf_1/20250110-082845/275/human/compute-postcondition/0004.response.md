The code creates a new list `field` by splitting each of the strings from `data` starting from the second element (index 1) up to `N` times. Each element in `field` is a list of strings resulting from the split operation.

- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string by newline characters.
- `N` and `M` are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N, M are odd.
- `P` is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10.
- `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `N` and `M` are the integers from the first line of `data`.

After the code execution:
- `field` is created as a list of lists, where each inner list contains the split elements from `data` starting from index 1 up to `N` times.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string by newline characters; `N` and `M` are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N, M are odd; `P` is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10; `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000; `MOD` is 10; `field` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the split elements from `data` starting from index 1 up to `N` times.**
