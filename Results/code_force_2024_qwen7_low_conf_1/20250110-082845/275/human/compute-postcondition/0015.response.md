The code appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given that `i` is 0 and `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG', the value of `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` will include the tuple `(0, j)`. The values of `M`, `cell`, `i`, and `j` are updated as follows:

- `i` remains 0.
- `cell` remains either 'RG' or 'BG'.
- A new element `(0, j)` is added to the list `goals[cell]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0; `M` must be greater than 0; `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]` and its value is either 'RG' or 'BG'; `goals['RG']` includes the tuple `(0, j)` if `cell` is 'RG', and `goals['BG']` includes the tuple `(0, j)` if `cell` is 'BG'.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `M` must be greater than 0; `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]` and its value is either 'RG' or 'BG'; `goals['RG']` includes the tuple `(0, j)` if `cell` is 'RG', and `goals['BG']` includes the tuple `(0, j)` if `cell` is 'BG'.**
