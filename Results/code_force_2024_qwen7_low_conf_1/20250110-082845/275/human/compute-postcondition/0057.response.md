The code assigns the current values of `i` and `j` to the variable `quaffle`. Initially, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0. Therefore, `quaffle` is updated to be the tuple `(1, 0)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is (1, 0), `bludger` is a tuple indicating the position of the bludger within `field` (or None if no bludger), `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value in `field` except 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B', and '..', and each value is a dictionary containing the player's position and whether they have the quaffle (False initially), `goals` is a dictionary with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'`, each containing a list of tuples representing the positions where goals were scored, and the cell at `field[i][j]` is now '.Q'**
