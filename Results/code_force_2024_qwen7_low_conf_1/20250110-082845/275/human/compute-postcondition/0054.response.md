`goals[cell].append((i, j))` appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given that `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG', and `i` is 1, `j` is 0, this operation adds a new tuple `(1, 0)` to the appropriate list in the `goals` dictionary.

The other variables (`M`, `i`, `j`, `cell`, `quaffle`, `bludger`, `players`, and `goals`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]` which is either 'RG' or 'BG', `quaffle` is a tuple indicating the position of the quaffle within `field` (or None if no quaffle), `bludger` is a tuple indicating the position of the bludger within `field` (or None if no bludger), `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value in `field` except 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B', and '..', and each value is a dictionary containing the player's position and whether they have the quaffle (False initially), `goals` is a dictionary with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'`, each containing a list of tuples representing the positions where goals were scored, and `goals[cell]` now includes the tuple `(1, 0)`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]` which is either 'RG' or 'BG', `quaffle` is a tuple indicating the position of the quaffle within `field` (or None if no quaffle), `bludger` is a tuple indicating the position of the bludger within `field` (or None if no bludger), `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value in `field` except 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B', and '..', and each value is a dictionary containing the player's position and whether they have the quaffle (False initially), `goals` is a dictionary with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'`, each containing a list of tuples representing the positions where goals were scored, and `goals[cell]` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0)`.**
