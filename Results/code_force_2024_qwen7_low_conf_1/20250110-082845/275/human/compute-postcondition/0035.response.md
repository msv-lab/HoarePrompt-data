Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the new value from `field[0][j]`, and the following holds true: if `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` includes the tuple `(0, j + 1)`, if `cell` is '.Q', then `quaffle` is `(0, 0)`, if `cell` is '.B', then `bludger` is `(0, j + 1)`, and in all other cases, `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (0, j + 1), 'has_quaffle': False}`. The if condition ensures that `cell` is not '..', and if this condition is met, `players[cell]` is updated accordingly.***
