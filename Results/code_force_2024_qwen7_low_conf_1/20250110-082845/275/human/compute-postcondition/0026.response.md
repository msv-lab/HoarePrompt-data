Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'), `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`, and `cell` is not equal to '.Q'. If `cell == '.B'`, then `bludger` is (0, j). Otherwise, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`, `players[cell]` is {'pos': (0, j), 'has_quaffle': False}, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'), `cell` is not equal to '.Q', and `cell` is not equal to '.B', and the current value of `cell` remains unchanged as it does not equal '.B'.***
