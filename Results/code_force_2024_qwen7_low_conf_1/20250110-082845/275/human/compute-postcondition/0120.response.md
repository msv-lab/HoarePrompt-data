The code assigns the value `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. This directly changes the value of `quaffle`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.

Given the initial conditions:
- `M` is greater than 0.
- `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`.
- If `cell` is in (`'RG', 'BG'`), then `goals[cell]` includes the tuple `(i, previous_j + 1)`.
- If `cell` is equal to `.Q`, then `quaffle` is set to `(i, previous_j + 1)`.
- If `cell` is equal to `.B`, then `bludger` is set to `(i, previous_j + 1)`.
- Otherwise, `cell` is not equal to `'.'`, and `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos': (i, previous_j + 1)` and `'has_quaffle': False`.

After the code execution, the new state is:
- `M` is greater than 0.
- `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`.
- `goals[cell]` is unchanged from its previous state.
- `quaffle` is now `(i, j)`.
- `bludger` remains unchanged from its previous state.
- `players[cell]` remains unchanged from its previous state unless `cell` was not `'.'`.

Since we only know the assignment to `quaffle`, and the other conditions are not affected by this line of code, the specific values of the unchanged variables remain as per the initial conditions or previous assignments.

Output State: **`M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `goals[cell]` is unchanged, `quaffle` is `(i, j)`, `bludger` is unchanged, `players[cell]` is unchanged unless `cell` was not `'.'`**
