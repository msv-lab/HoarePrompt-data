The code assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. The variables `M` and `cell` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` is greater than 0; `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`; `quaffle` is `(i, j)`.
Output State: **`M` is greater than 0; `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`; `quaffle` is `(i, j)`**
