Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `cell` is the value of `field[1][2]`; if `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals[cell]` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`, if `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is set to `(1, 1)`, if `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is set to `(1, 1)` or `(1, 2)`, otherwise `players[cell]` is either `{'pos': (1, 1), 'has_quaffle': False}` if `cell` is not `'..'`, or remains unchanged if `cell` is `'..'`.**
