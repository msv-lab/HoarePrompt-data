According to the given for loop statement, the loop iterates over a range from 0 to `N-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `i` would have the value of `N-2` because the loop increments `i` at the beginning of each iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented and checked against `N`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `N`.

Given that `i` is currently `N-2`, the next value of `i` will be `N-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`, which it will be if `N` is greater than `N-1`.

So, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`i` is N-1, `N` must be greater than N-1**
