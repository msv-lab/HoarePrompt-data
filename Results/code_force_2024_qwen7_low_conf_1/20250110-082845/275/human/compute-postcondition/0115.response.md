Postcondition: ***`M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`. If `cell` is equal to '.Q', then `quaffle` is `(i, j)`. If `cell` is equal to '.B', then `bludger` is set to `(i, j)`. Otherwise, `cell` is not equal to '.' and `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos': (i, j)` and `'has_quaffle': False`.***
