Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `cell` is the value of `field[1][1]`. If `cell` is in ('RG', 'BG'), then `goals[cell]` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`. If `cell` is equal to '.Q', `quaffle` is set to (1, 1). If `cell` is equal to '.B', `bludger` is set to (1, 1). Otherwise, `players[cell]` is either {'pos': (1, 1), 'has_quaffle': False} if `cell` is not '..', or remains unchanged if `cell` is..'***
