`goals[cell].append((i, j))` appends the tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given the initial state, `cell` is either 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B', or another cell value with `players[cell]` being {'pos': (1, 1), 'has_quaffle': False} if `cell` is not '..', or unchanged if `cell` is '..'. Since the exact value of `cell` is not specified, we'll consider the general case for 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', and '.B'.

- If `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG':
  - `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` initially contains the tuple `(1, 1)`.
  - After executing the code, `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` will become `(1, 1), (1, 2)`.
- If `cell` is '.Q':
  - `quaffle` is set to `(1, 1)`.
  - After executing the code, `goals['.Q']` will become `(1, 1), (1, 2)`.
- If `cell` is '.B':
  - `bludger` is set to `(1, 1)`.
  - After executing the code, `goals['.B']` will become `(1, 1), (1, 2)`.

Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG' or '.Q' or '.B' or another cell value, if `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG' or '.Q' or '.B', then `goals[cell]` is `(1, 1), (1, 2)`, otherwise `players[cell]` is either {'pos': (1, 1), 'has_quaffle': False} if `cell` is not '..', or remains unchanged if `cell` is..'**
