The code `data = input().split('\n')` reads an input string, splits it by newline characters, and stores the resulting list of strings in the variable `data`. This operation affects the value of `input`, which is now converted into a list of strings. The values of `N`, `M`, `P`, and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `data` and the unchanged values of `N`, `M`, `P`, and `T`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string by newline characters; `N` and `M` are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N, M are odd; `P` is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10; `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000**
