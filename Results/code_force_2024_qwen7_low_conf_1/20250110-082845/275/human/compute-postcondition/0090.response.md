According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. The loop will execute as long as `M` is greater than 0. The initial state of `i` being `N-1` and `N` being greater than `N-1` does not directly impact the loop's execution. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `M` must be greater than 0.

State: **`M` must be greater than 0**
