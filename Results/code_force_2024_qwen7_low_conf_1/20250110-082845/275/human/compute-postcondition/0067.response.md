Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `cell` is the value of `field[1][0]`. Depending on the value of `cell`:
- If `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', `goals[cell]` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0)`.
- If `cell` is '.Q', the cell at `field[1][0]` is set to '.Q'.
- If `cell` is '.B', the bludger's position changes to (1, 0).
- Otherwise, the state of the players, `quaffle`, `bludger`, and `goals` remains unchanged.**
