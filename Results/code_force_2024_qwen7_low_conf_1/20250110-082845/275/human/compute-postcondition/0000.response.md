The given code snippet reads input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. This function reads the entire input as a single string and does not modify any of the variables defined in the initial state. The values of `N`, `M`, `P`, `T`, and the field representation remain unchanged.

Output State: **N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N, M are odd. P is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10. T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. The field is represented as a list of N strings, where each string contains M characters. Each pair of characters in the field can be one of the following: '..', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'. There is exactly one '.Q' and at most one '.B' in the field. The input is read as a single string and stored in `input`.**
