Postcondition: ***`i` is `N - 1`, `M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]` for all iterations of the loop, `quaffle` is the position of the quaffle within `field` (or `(N // 2, M // 2)` if `command != 'C'`), `bludger` is the position of the bludger within `field` (or `None` if no bludger), `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value in `field` except 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B', and '..', and each value is a dictionary containing the player's position and whether they have the quaffle (`True` for the player corresponding to `entity` if `command == 'C'`, otherwise `False` for the player identified by `entity`), `goals` is a dictionary with keys 'RG' and 'BG', `red_score` and `blue_score` are updated based on the condition whether `quaffle` is in the 'RG' or 'BG' goal, `events` is a list containing the event corresponding to the goal type (either `'t RED GOAL'` or `'t BLUE GOAL'`) if `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` is `True`, otherwise `events` is an empty list, `entity` is the first element of the list `action`, `command` is either 'C' or 'T', `x` is the x-coordinate of the player's position, `y` is the y-coordinate of the player's position.***
