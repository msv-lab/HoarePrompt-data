The code `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7` assigns the value `10 ** 9 + 7` to the variable `MOD`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`data`, `N`, `M`, `P`, `T`). 

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string by newline characters; `N` and `M` are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N, M are odd; `P` is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10; `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000; `MOD` is 10 ** 9 + 7**
