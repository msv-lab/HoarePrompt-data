According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `M`. If `j` is less than `M`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `i` is 0
- `M` is greater than 0
- `cell` is the new value from `field[0][j]`, and the following holds true:
  - if `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` includes the tuples `(0, j + 1)` and `(0, j)`
  - if `cell` is '.Q', then `quaffle` is `(0, 0)`
  - if `cell` is '.B', then `bludger` is `(0, j + 1)`
  - in all other cases, `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (0, j + 1), 'has_quaffle': False, 'goals': [(0, j)]}`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `M`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- Since `i` is not incremented inside the loop, it remains 0.
- `M` remains greater than 0.
- `j` is increased by 1, so it becomes `j + 1`.
- `cell` is now the new value from `field[0][j + 1]`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is 0
- `M` is greater than 0
- `cell` is the new value from `field[0][j + 1]`, and the following holds true:
  - if `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` includes the tuples `(0, j + 2)` and `(0, j + 1)`
  - if `cell` is '.Q', then `quaffle` is `(0, 0)`
  - if `cell` is '.B', then `bludger` is `(0, j + 2)`
  - in all other cases, `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (0, j + 2), 'has_quaffle': False, 'goals': [(0, j + 1)]}`

State: **`i` is 0, `M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the new value from `field[0][j + 1]`, and the following holds true: if `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` includes the tuples `(0, j + 2)` and `(0, j + 1)`, if `cell` is '.Q', then `quaffle` is `(0, 0)`, if `cell` is '.B', then `bludger` is `(0, j + 2)`, and in all other cases, `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (0, j + 2), 'has_quaffle': False, 'goals': [(0, j + 1)]}`.**
