The code appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. The values of `M` and `cell` are not affected by this code. The value of `goals[cell]` is now updated to include the tuple `(i, j)`.

Output State: **`M` is greater than 0; `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`; `goals[cell]` includes the tuple `(i, j)`**
