The code `bludger = i, j` assigns a tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `bludger`. The initial value of `i` is 0, and `j` is not specified, but it must be an integer. The value of `bludger` changes, while the other variables remain unaffected according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is the new value from `field[0][j]`, if `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` includes the tuple `(0, j + 1)`, if `cell` is '.Q', then `quaffle` is `(0, 0)`, if `cell` is '.B', then `bludger` is `(0, j + 1)`, in all other cases, `players[cell]` is {'pos': (0, j + 1), 'has_quaffle': False}, `bludger` is (0, j)**
