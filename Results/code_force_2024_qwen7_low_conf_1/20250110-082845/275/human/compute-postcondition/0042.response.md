The code `quaffle = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. This changes the value of `quaffle` from its previous state. The initial state of `quaffle` was `(0, 0)` if `cell` was `.Q`. Now, `quaffle` is updated to `(i, j)`. 

Other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state. 

Output State: **`i` is 0; `M` is greater than 0; `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`; if `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` includes the tuples `(0, j + 2)` and `(0, j + 1); if `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is `(i, j)`; if `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is `(0, j + 2); in all other cases, `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (0, j + 2), 'has_quaffle': False, 'goals': [(0, j + 1)]}`**
