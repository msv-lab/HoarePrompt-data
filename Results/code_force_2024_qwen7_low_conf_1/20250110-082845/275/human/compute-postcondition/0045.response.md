Postcondition: ***`i` is 0; `M` is greater than 0; `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`; if `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is no longer relevant; if `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is no longer relevant; if `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is no longer relevant; in all other cases, `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}`.***
