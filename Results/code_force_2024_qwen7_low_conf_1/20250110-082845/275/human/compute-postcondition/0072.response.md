The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variable `bludger`. Before the assignment, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. Therefore, `bludger` will be assigned the tuple `(1, 1)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `cell` is the value of `field[1][1]`, `bludger` is (1, 1)**
