Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'), `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`. If `cell` is '.Q', then `quaffle` is (0, 0). Otherwise, if `cell` is '.B', then `bludger` is (0, j). In all other cases, `players[cell]` is {'pos': (0, j), 'has_quaffle': False}, and `cell` remains unchanged.***
