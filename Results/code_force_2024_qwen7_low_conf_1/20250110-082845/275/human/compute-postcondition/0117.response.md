To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and analyze each part step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `M` is greater than 0.
- `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`.
- Depending on the value of `cell`, different conditions are met:
  - If `cell` is in (`'RG', 'BG'`), then `goals[cell]` includes the tuple `(i, j)`.
  - If `cell` is equal to `.Q`, then `quaffle` is set to `(i, j)`.
  - If `cell` is equal to `.B`, then `bludger` is set to `(i, j)`.
  - Otherwise, `cell` is not equal to `'.'`, and `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos': (i, j)` and `'has_quaffle': False`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `M-1`. For each iteration, it checks the value of `field[i][j]` and updates the state accordingly.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- The current value of `j` is the last value checked during the previous iteration.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider what happens when `j` increases by 1.

### Adjusted States:
- Since the loop increments `j` by 1, the new value of `j` will be `previous_j + 1`.
- The value of `cell` will be `field[i][previous_j + 1]`.
- We need to check if `cell` is in (`'RG', 'BG'`, `.Q`, `.B`) or not.

### Conclusion:
- If `cell` is in (`'RG', 'BG'`, `.Q`, `.B`), the corresponding state will update as per the conditions mentioned.
- If `cell` is not equal to `'.'`, `players[cell]` will be updated to have `'pos': (i, previous_j + 1)` and `'has_quaffle': False`.

### Final State:
Since the exact value of `cell` is not specified for the next iteration, we cannot specify the exact state changes. However, we can state the general condition:

State: **`M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][previous_j + 1]`. If `cell` is in (`'RG', 'BG'`), then `goals[cell]` includes the tuple `(i, previous_j + 1)`. If `cell` is equal to `.Q`, then `quaffle` is set to `(i, previous_j + 1)`. If `cell` is equal to `.B`, then `bludger` is set to `(i, previous_j + 1)`. Otherwise, `cell` is not equal to `'.'`, and `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos': (i, previous_j + 1)` and `'has_quaffle': False`.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next value of `j`.
