Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `cell` is the value of `field[1][0]`, `quaffle` is (1, 0), `bludger` is either a tuple indicating the new position of the bludger (if the cell was '.B') or remains at (1, 0), `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value in `field` except 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B', and '..', and each value is a dictionary containing the player's position and whether they have the quaffle (False initially), `goals` is a dictionary with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'`, each containing a list of tuples representing the positions where goals were scored. If `cell` is '.Q', the cell at `field[1][0]` is set to '.Q'. If `cell` is '.B', the bludger's position changes to (1, 0). Otherwise, the state of the players and other variables remains unchanged.***
