Postcondition: ***`M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, and `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG', '.', '.B', '..'). If `cell` is not '..', `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG', '.', '.B', '..') remains true and `players[cell]` is {'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}. There is no else part in the code, so no additional conditions are applied.***
