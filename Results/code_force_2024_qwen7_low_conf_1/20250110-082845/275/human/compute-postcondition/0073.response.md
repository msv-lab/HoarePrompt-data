The code assigns a dictionary to the key `cell` in the `players` dictionary, setting the position to `(i, j)` and indicating that the player does not have the quaffle. The values of `i`, `j`, and `cell` remain unchanged.

- `i` is 1
- `M` is greater than 1
- `j` is 1
- `cell` is the value of `field[1][1]`

After executing the code, the new information is that there is a player at position `(i, j)` which is `(1, 1)`, and this player does not have the quaffle.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `cell` is the value of `field[1][1]`, `players[cell]` is `{'pos': (1, 1), 'has_quaffle': False}`**
