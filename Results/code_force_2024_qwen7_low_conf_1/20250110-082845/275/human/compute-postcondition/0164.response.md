Postcondition: `i` is `N - 1`, `M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]` for all iterations of the loop, `quaffle` is `(x, y)`, `bludger` is the position of the bludger within `field` (or `None` if no bludger), `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value in `field` except 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B', and '..', and each value is a dictionary containing the player's position and whether they have the quaffle (`False` for the player identified by `entity`), `goals` is a dictionary with keys 'RG' and 'BG', `red_score` is 0, `blue_score` is 0, `events` is an empty list, `entity` is the first element of the list `action`, `command` is 'T', `x` is the x-coordinate of the player's position, `y` is the y-coordinate of the player's position, and the `quaffle` is in the goal corresponding to `goal_type`, and the condition `(goal_type == 'BG' and entity[0] == 'R')` is true
