Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `cell` is the value of `field[1][0]`, `quaffle` is a tuple indicating the position of the quaffle within `field` (or None if no quaffle), `bludger` is (1, 0), `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value in `field` except 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B', and '..', and each value is a dictionary containing the player's position and whether they have the quaffle (False initially), `goals` is a dictionary with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'`, each containing a list of tuples representing the positions where goals were scored. If `cell` is '.B', the bludger's position changes to (1, 0). If `cell` is not '.B', the player at position (1, 0) remains with `has_quaffle` as `False` and no change occurs in the state of the players or other variables.***
