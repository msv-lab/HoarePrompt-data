Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `cell` is the value of `field[1][2]`. If `cell` is '.Q', then `quaffle` is set to (1, 2). If `cell` is 'RG' or 'BG', `goals[cell]` contains the tuple (1, 1). If `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is set to (1, 1) or (1, 2). Otherwise, `players[cell]` is either {'pos': (1, 1), 'has_quaffle': False} if `cell` is not '..', or remains unchanged if `cell` is '..'.***
