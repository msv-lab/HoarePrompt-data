Postcondition: **`M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`. If `cell` is in (`'RG', 'BG'`), then `goals[cell]` is updated accordingly (either `[ (i, j) ]` or includes the tuple `(i, previous_j + 1)`). If `cell` is `.Q`, then `quaffle` is set to `(i, previous_j + 1)`. If `cell` is `.B`, then `bludger` is set to `(i, previous_j + 1)`. For any other `cell`, `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos': (i, previous_j + 1)` and `'has_quaffle': False`.**
