The code assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. The previous value of `cell` is `.Q`, and this value is not stored anywhere in the given code. The variables `M`, `cell`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'), `quaffle` is (i, j)**
