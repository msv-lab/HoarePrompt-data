`goals[cell].append((i, j))` appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list associated with the key `cell` in the dictionary `goals`. The value of `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG', and the value of `M` is greater than 0, but the specific values of `i` and `j` are not provided. The code does not affect the value of `M`. Therefore, the Output State is: `M` is greater than 0; `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG'; `goals[cell]` includes an additional tuple `(i, j)`.

Output State: **`M` is greater than 0; `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG'; `goals[cell]` includes an additional tuple `(i, j)`**
