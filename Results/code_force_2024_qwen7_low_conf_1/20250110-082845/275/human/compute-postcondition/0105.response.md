Postcondition: ***`M` is greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, and `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG', '.', '.B', '..'). If `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is set to (i, j). If `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is set to (i, j). Otherwise, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG', '.', '.B', '..') remains true and `players[cell]` is updated to {'pos': (i, j), 'has_quaffle': False}.***
