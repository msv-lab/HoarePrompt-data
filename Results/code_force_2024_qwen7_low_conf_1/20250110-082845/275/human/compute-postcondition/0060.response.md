The code `bludger = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `bludger`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 1 and `j` is 0. Therefore, the value of `bludger` becomes `(1, 0)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `cell` is '.B', `quaffle` is a tuple indicating the position of the quaffle within `field` (or None if no quaffle), `bludger` is (1, 0), `players` is a dictionary where each key is a cell value in `field` except 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B', and '..', and each value is a dictionary containing the player's position and whether they have the quaffle (False initially), `goals` is a dictionary with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'`, each containing a list of tuples representing the positions where goals were scored, and the cell at `field[i][j]` is '.B'**
