The code initializes a dictionary `tree` where each key is a vertex from 1 to `n` and the corresponding value is an empty list. This dictionary will represent the adjacency list of the tree.

Since no other variables are affected, the only change is the creation of the `tree` dictionary.

Output State: **`tree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` and values as empty lists; n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges.**
