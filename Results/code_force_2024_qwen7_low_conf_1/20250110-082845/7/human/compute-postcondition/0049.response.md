`distances[neighbor]` is assigned the value `current_distance + 1`. This means that the distance of the `neighbor` from the starting node is updated to be one more than the `current_distance`. The `queue` is a collection with one less element than before, and `tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `distances`.

Output State: **`queue` is a collection with one less element than before, `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`**
