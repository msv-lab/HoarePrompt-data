`tree[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list associated with the key `u` in the dictionary `tree`. Given the initial state, `u` is set to the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, and `v` is set to the second element of the next tuple in `edges`. This means that the list associated with key `u` in `tree` will have the value `[u, u]` and will now also include `v`.

Output State: **`edges` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple (one less than before); `tree` is a dictionary initialized with keys from 1 to `n`, and each key has an empty list as its value, except for key `u` which now has `[u, u, v]` appended to its list; `u` is set to the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, and `v` is set to the second element of the next tuple in `edges`.**
