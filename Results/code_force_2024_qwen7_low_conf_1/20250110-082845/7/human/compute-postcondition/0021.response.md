The code appends a tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` to the list `operations`. The value of `nodes_at_d[0]` is the first element of the list `nodes_at_d`, and `d` retains its original value. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from `distances` where the distance is equal to `d`; `distances` and `d` retain their original values; `operations` is a list with an additional tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` appended to it.**
