According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. The loop iterates over `d` in the range from 0 to `max_distance`. At the end of the last iteration, we need to determine the state of the variables `nodes_at_d`, `distances`, `d`, and `operations`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `d` is within the range `range(max_distance + 1)`. If `d` is less than `max_distance + 1`, the loop will continue.

2. **Determine the Value of `d` at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The value of `d` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. If `d` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `d` will be `k + 1`.

3. **Check the State of `nodes_at_d` and `operations`**:
   - If `nodes_at_d` was non-empty at the end of the previous iteration, it means that a new tuple was added to `operations`.
   - If `nodes_at_d` was empty, no changes were made to `operations`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - If `nodes_at_d` was non-empty, `nodes_at_d` will still be a list of nodes from `distances` where the distance is equal to `d + 1`.
   - `distances` and `d` retain their original values.
   - `operations` will have an additional tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)` appended to it.

Given this information, let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `nodes_at_d` was non-empty (let's say it contained some nodes). Therefore, for the next iteration, `d` will be incremented by 1, and a new tuple will be appended to `operations`.

State: **`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from `distances` where the distance is equal to `d + 1`, `distances` and `d` retain their original values, `operations` has an additional tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)` appended to it**.
