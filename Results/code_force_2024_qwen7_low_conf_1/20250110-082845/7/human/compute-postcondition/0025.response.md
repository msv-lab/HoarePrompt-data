The code `operations.append((nodes_at_d[0], d))` appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. This tuple contains the first element of `nodes_at_d` and the value of `d`. The `distances` and `d` retain their original values, and the `nodes_at_d` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `operations` list.

Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is updated to include nodes from `distances` where the distance is equal to `d`; `distances` and `d` retain their original values; `operations` now has an additional tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` appended to it.**
