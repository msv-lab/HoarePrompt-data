The code creates a list `nodes_at_d` containing nodes from the dictionary `distances` where the distance `dist` is equal to the value `d`. This means that `nodes_at_d` is populated with nodes whose distance matches `d`.

However, the code does not assign this list back to any variable, nor does it change the values of `max_distance`, `nodes_at_d`, or `distances`. Therefore, the only impact is the creation of the list `nodes_at_d` which holds nodes with a specific distance `d`.

Output State: **`max_distance` is a non-negative integer, `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance in `distances` is equal to `d`**
