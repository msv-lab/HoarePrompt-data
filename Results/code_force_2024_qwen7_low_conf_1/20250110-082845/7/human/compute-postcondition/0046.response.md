The code `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the variable `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. Based on the initial state, the `queue` was a collection with one less element than before, `node` was equal to the original first element of `queue`, `current_distance` was equal to `distances[node]`, and `distances[neighbor]` was updated to `current_distance + 1`.

After executing the code, the `queue` will have one more element, which is `neighbor`. All other variables retain their values from the initial state.

Output State: **`queue` is a collection with one more element than before (it originally had one less element), `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`, and `distances[neighbor]` is updated to `current_distance + 1`.**
