The code `tree[v].append(u)` appends `u` to the list associated with the key `v` in the dictionary `tree`. According to the initial state, `tree` is a dictionary initialized with keys from 1 to `n`, and each key has an empty list as its value, except for key `v`, which now has `[u]` appended to its list. 

Given this, the previous state of `tree` is:
- For all keys `k` in `tree`, if `k != v`, then `tree[k]` is an empty list.
- If `k == v`, then `tree[k]` is `[u]`.

After executing `tree[v].append(u)`, the new state of `tree[v]` will be `[u, u]` because `u` is already present in `tree[v]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `edges` remains a list of tuples with at least one tuple (one less than before).
- `tree` now has `tree[v]` updated to `[u, u]`.
- `u` and `v` remain the same.

Output State: **`edges` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple (one less than before); `tree` is a dictionary initialized with keys from 1 to `n`, and each key has an empty list as its value, except for key `v` which now has `[u, u]` appended to its list; `u` is set to the first element of the tuple in `edges`, and `v` is set to the second element of the tuple in `edges`.**
