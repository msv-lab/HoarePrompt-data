Postcondition: ***`tree` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `start_node` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `queue` is not empty and now includes the next `neighbor` of the current `node`, `distances` is a dictionary containing `{start_node: 0}` and for every node reachable from `start_node`, `{node: distance_from_start_node}`, with the next `neighbor`: `distances[neighbor]` updated to `current_distance + 1` if `neighbor` is not already in `distances`, and `queue` is appended with the `neighbor` node if it is not in `distances`.***
