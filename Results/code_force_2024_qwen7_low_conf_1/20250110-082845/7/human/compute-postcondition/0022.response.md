Postcondition: ***`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from `distances` where the distance is equal to `d`; `distances` and `d` retain their original values; `operations` is a list with an additional tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` appended to it, if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. Otherwise, `nodes_at_d`, `distances`, and `d` retain their original values, and `operations` remains unchanged.***
