The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `operations`. This does not affect the values of the `distances` or `tree` dictionaries. Therefore, the only change is that the `operations` list is now initialized.

Output State: **`distances` is a dictionary containing distances from node 1 to all other nodes; `tree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of all vertices that are connected to it through edges in the graph represented by `edges`; `operations` is an empty list**
