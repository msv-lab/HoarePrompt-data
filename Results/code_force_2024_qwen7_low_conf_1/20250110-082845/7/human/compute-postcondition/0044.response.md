Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `queue` is a collection with one less element than before.
   - `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`.
   - `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`.
   - `tree[node]` must have at least one neighbor.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `tree[node]`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one neighbor left in `tree[node]`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `tree[node]` must have at least one neighbor, we need to ensure that `tree[node]` still has at least one neighbor to continue the loop.
   - `node` remains the same as it was at the start of this iteration.
   - `current_distance` remains the same as it was at the start of this iteration.
   - `queue` now has one less element than before, but since we are adjusting the state for the next iteration, we can assume it still has elements to process.

5. **New State**:
   - We need to ensure `tree[node]` still has at least one neighbor for the loop to continue.
   - `node` remains unchanged.
   - `current_distance` remains unchanged.
   - `queue` will have one less element, but we don't need to specify its exact contents unless necessary.

Thus, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:

State: **`queue` is a collection with one less element than before, `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`, and `tree[node]` must have at least one neighbor.**
