The code `max_distance = max(distances.values())` finds the maximum value among the values in the `distances` dictionary and assigns it to `max_distance`. This does not affect the `tree` dictionary or the `operations` list. Therefore, the `distances` dictionary remains unchanged, the `tree` dictionary stays the same, and the `operations` list remains empty.

Output State: **`distances` is a dictionary containing distances from node 1 to all other nodes; `tree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to n (inclusive) has a list of all vertices that are connected to it through edges in the graph represented by `edges`; `operations` is an empty list; `max_distance` is the maximum value among the values in the `distances` dictionary.**
