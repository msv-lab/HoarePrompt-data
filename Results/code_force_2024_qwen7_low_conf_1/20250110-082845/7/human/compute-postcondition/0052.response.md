Output State: **`queue` is an empty collection, `node` is the original first element of `queue` when the loop started, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`, and `distances` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph represented by `tree`.**

### Explanation:
- **`queue`**: The `queue` starts with one element and decreases by one element each time the loop runs until it becomes empty. This means that after the loop finishes, there are no more elements left in the `queue`.
  
- **`node`**: Initially, `node` is set to the first element of `queue`. As the loop progresses and `queue` gets updated, `node` eventually holds the original first element of `queue` when the loop started, as the loop would terminate when `queue` is empty.

- **`current_distance`**: This is initialized to `distances[node]` and remains unchanged throughout the loop unless the loop does not execute at all. It represents the distance of the node from the starting node.

- **`distances`**: During each iteration of the loop, if a neighbor of the current node (`node`) is not yet in the `distances` dictionary, its distance is set to `current_distance + 1`. This ensures that all reachable nodes from the starting node are added to the `distances` dictionary with their shortest path distances. By the end of the loop, `distances` will contain the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph.

In the case where the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `queue` is initially empty), the values of the variables will be:
- `queue` is an empty collection.
- `node` is undefined or can be considered as the original first element of an empty `queue` (which is effectively undefined).
- `current_distance` remains as the initial value, which is `distances[node]` (undefined since `node` is undefined).
- `distances` remains unchanged, still being the initial `distances` dictionary.
