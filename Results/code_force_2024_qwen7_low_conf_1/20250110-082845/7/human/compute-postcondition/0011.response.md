The code `distances = func_1(tree, 1)` calls a function `func_1` with two arguments: `tree`, which is a dictionary representing a graph, and `1`, which is a starting node. The function `func_1` presumably calculates the distances from the starting node (node 1) to all other nodes in the graph.

However, since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the `distances` dictionary. But we know that `distances` will be updated to contain the distances from node 1 to all other nodes.

The initial state is:
- `tree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of all vertices that are connected to it through edges in the graph represented by `edges`.

After executing the code, the output state is:
- `distances` is a dictionary containing the distances from node 1 to all other nodes in the graph.
- The dictionary `tree` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`distances` is a dictionary containing distances from node 1 to all other nodes; `tree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of all vertices that are connected to it through edges in the graph represented by `edges`.**
