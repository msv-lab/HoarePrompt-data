Output State: **`tree` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `start_node` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `queue` is not empty and now includes the next `neighbor` of the current `node`, `distances` is a dictionary containing `{start_node: 0}` and for every node reachable from `start_node`, `{node: distance_from_start_node}` with the next `neighbor`: `distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1`, and `current_distance` is set to the distance of the next `neighbor` of the current `node` from `start_node` in `distances`, `queue` is appended with the `neighbor` node.**
