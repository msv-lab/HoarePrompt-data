`queue` is a non-empty list or collection from which the first element is removed using `popleft()`, and the removed element is assigned to `node`. After executing this line, the `queue` will have one less element, and `node` will hold the value of the first element that was removed. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` is now a collection (one element less than before), `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`.

Output State: **`queue` is a collection (one element less than before), `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`**
