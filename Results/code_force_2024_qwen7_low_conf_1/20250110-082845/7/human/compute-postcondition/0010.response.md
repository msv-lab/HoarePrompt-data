Output State: **`tree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of all vertices that are connected to it through edges in the graph represented by `edges`.** 

Explanation:
- Initially, `tree` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` and each key has an empty list as its value.
- The loop iterates over each edge `(u, v)` in `edges` and appends both `u` to `v`'s list and `v` to `u`'s list.
- After executing the loop, every vertex `u` and `v` that are connected by an edge will have each other in their respective lists.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, `tree` will represent the adjacency lists of a graph where each key corresponds to a vertex and its value is a list of all vertices directly connected to it.
