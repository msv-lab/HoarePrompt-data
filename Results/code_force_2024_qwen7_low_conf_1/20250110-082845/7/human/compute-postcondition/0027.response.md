Output State: **`max_distance` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(node, d)` such that `node` is a node in `distances` and `d` is the distance of `node` from node 1, and `distances` retains its original values.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `d = 0` to `d = max_distance`.
- For each value of `d`, it checks if there are any nodes in `distances` whose distance is `d`.
- If such nodes exist, it appends a tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` to `operations`, where `nodes_at_d` is the list of nodes with distance `d`.
- After the loop completes, `operations` will contain all the tuples added during the loop, corresponding to all nodes and their respective distances.
- The `distances` dictionary and `max_distance` remain unchanged from their initial values since the loop only appends to `operations` based on the existing `distances` and does not modify the dictionary itself.
