The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `edges`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple `(u, v)` represents an edge connecting vertices `u` and `v`. The tree is guaranteed to be acyclic with `n-1` edges. The function returns the length of the list 'operations' and the list 'operations' itself, where each element in 'operations' is a tuple of the form `(node, d)`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of edges, and return the length of the list 'operations' and the list 'operations' itself, where each element in 'operations' is a tuple of the form `(node, d)`.
