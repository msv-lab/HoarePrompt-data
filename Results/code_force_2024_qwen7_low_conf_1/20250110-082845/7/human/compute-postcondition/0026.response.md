Postcondition: ***`nodes_at_d` is updated to include nodes from `distances` where the distance is equal to `d`; `distances` and `d` retain their original values; `operations` now has either an additional tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)` or `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` appended to it, depending on whether `nodes_at_d` is non-empty or empty, respectively.***
