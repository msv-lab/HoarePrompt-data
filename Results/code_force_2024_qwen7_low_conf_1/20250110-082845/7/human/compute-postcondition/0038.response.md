The code assigns the value of `distances[node]` to the variable `current_distance`. This does not change the size of the `queue` or the value of `node`. The value of `current_distance` is now set to the distance corresponding to the node.

Output State: **`queue` is a collection (one element less than before), `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`**
