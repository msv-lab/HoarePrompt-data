The code snippet updates the `distances` dictionary by setting `distances[neighbor]` to `current_distance + 1`. This means that the distance of the `neighbor` from the `start_node` is being recorded as one more than the current distance. All other variables remain unchanged.

- `tree` remains the same, as it is not affected by this line of code.
- `start_node` remains the same, as it is not affected by this line of code.
- `queue` remains the same, as it is not affected by this line of code.
- `distances` is updated to include `distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1`.
- `current_distance` remains the same, as it is only used to calculate the new distance and is not modified.

Given the initial conditions:
- `distances` initially contains `{start_node: 0}` and for every node reachable from `start_node`, `{node: distance_from_start_node}` with the next neighbor having a distance of `current_distance + 1`.
- After executing `distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1`, the distances dictionary will have an additional entry with the `neighbor` node and its distance as `current_distance + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`tree` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `start_node` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `queue` is not empty and now includes the next `neighbor` of the current `node`, `distances` is a dictionary containing `{start_node: 0}` and for every node reachable from `start_node`, `{node: distance_from_start_node}` with the next `neighbor`: `distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1`, and `current_distance` is set to the distance of the next `neighbor` of the current `node` from `start_node` in `distances`.**
