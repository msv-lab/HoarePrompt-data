Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Conditions:**
   - `max_distance`: A non-negative integer.
   - `nodes_at_d`: A list of nodes where each node's distance in `distances` is equal to `d`.
   - `operations`: A list of tuples where each tuple is `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. Otherwise, no changes are made.

2. **Current State:**
   - `max_distance` is a non-negative integer.
   - `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance in `distances` is equal to `d`.
   - If `nodes_at_d` is not empty, `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `operations`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `d = 0` to `d = max_distance`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `d` will be `current_d + 1`.

5. **Check the New State:**
   - We need to check if `nodes_at_d` is not empty for the new value of `d`.
   - If `nodes_at_d` is not empty, add the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` to `operations`.

Given the current state, let's assume the following values (these are placeholders since the actual values are not provided):

- Suppose `max_distance` is 5.
- Suppose `nodes_at_d` is not empty for `d = 3`, and `nodes_at_d[0]` is node 10.

6. **New State Calculation:**
   - Since we are moving to the next iteration, `d` will be `3 + 1 = 4`.
   - Check if `nodes_at_d` is not empty for `d = 4`.
   - If it is not empty, add `(nodes_at_d[0], 4)` to `operations`.

Since the exact values are not given, we will use the general form:

- `max_distance` remains the same.
- `nodes_at_d` must be checked for the new value of `d`.
- If `nodes_at_d` is not empty, update `operations` accordingly.

**Final State:**

State: **`max_distance` is a non-negative integer, `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance in `distances` is equal to `d + 1`, if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `operations`.**
