State before the loop starts: `queue` is a collection (one element less than before), `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tree[node]`. The loop will execute if `tree[node]` contains at least one neighbor. Here are the necessary adjustments:

1. The `queue` is a collection with one less element than before, but this does not directly affect the loop's execution.
2. `node` is set to the original first element of `queue`.
3. `current_distance` is set to `distances[node]`.

For the loop to execute, `tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor.

State: **`queue` is a collection (one element less than before), `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`, `tree[node]` must have at least one neighbor**
