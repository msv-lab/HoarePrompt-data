Postcondition: **`queue` is a collection with one less element than before, `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`, and `tree[node]` must have at least one neighbor. If `neighbor` is not in `distances`, then `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`.**
