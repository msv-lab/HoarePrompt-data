The code appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The `neighbor` is not in `distances` initially, and its distance (`distances[neighbor]`) is set to `current_distance + 1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`queue` is a collection with one more element than before, `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`, `tree[node]` must have at least one neighbor, and the `neighbor` specified in the if condition is not in `distances`; `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`.**
