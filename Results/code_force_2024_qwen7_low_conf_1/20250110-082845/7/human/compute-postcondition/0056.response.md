Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tree`, a dictionary representing an adjacency list of a tree, and a parameter `start_node`, an integer representing the starting vertex for the BFS operation. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path distances from the `start_node` to all other nodes in the graph represented by `tree`. The function returns a dictionary containing these shortest path distances. The BFS algorithm starts from `start_node`, explores all its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, and updates the distance to each node as it discovers new paths. The function correctly handles the case where the `start_node` is not directly connected to any other nodes, resulting in a distance of infinity for those nodes. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the `distances` dictionary contains the shortest path distances from the `start_node` to all other nodes in the graph, with unconnected nodes having a distance of infinity.**
