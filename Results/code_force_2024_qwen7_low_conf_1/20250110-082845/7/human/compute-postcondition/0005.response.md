Output State: **`edges` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple (one less than before); `tree` is a dictionary initialized with keys from 1 to `n`, and each key has an empty list as its value, except for key `v` which now has `[u]` appended to its list; `u` is set to the first element of the tuple in `edges`, and `v` is set to the second element of the tuple in `edges`; `tree[u].append(v)` has been executed.**
