The code snippet updates the `nodes_at_d` variable by filtering nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d`. This means `nodes_at_d` will now be a list of nodes whose distances match `d`. However, the actual values of `nodes_at_d`, `distances`, and `d` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot provide specific values for `nodes_at_d`. Instead, we will keep the general form.

The original `nodes_at_d` is updated, but `distances` and `d` retain their original values. Additionally, an operation is appended to `operations`.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `nodes_at_d` is updated to include nodes from `distances` where the distance is equal to `d`.
- `distances` and `d` remain unchanged.
- An additional tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)` is appended to `operations`.

Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is updated to include nodes from `distances` where the distance is equal to `d`; `distances` and `d` retain their original values; operations has an additional tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)` appended to it**
