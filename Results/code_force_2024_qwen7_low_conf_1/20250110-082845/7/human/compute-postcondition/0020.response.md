The code creates a list `nodes_at_d` by iterating over the `distances` dictionary and selecting nodes whose distance (`dist`) is equal to `d`. The values of `distances` and `d` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact elements of `nodes_at_d`. However, we can describe the state of the variables involved.

- `nodes_at_d` is a list created from the items in `distances` where the distance is equal to `d`.
- The values of `distances` and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from `distances` where the distance is equal to `d`; `distances` and `d` retain their original values.**
