The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tree` and `start_node`. 

- `tree` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, where each key is a vertex (an integer) and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices (integers).
- `start_node` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the breadth-first search (BFS) operation, such that 1 <= `start_node` <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.

After executing the function body, the function returns a dictionary (`distances`) containing the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph represented by `tree`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tree represented as a dictionary and a starting node, and return the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `tree`, a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, and a parameter `start_node`, an integer representing the starting vertex for the BFS operation. It returns a dictionary containing the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph represented by `tree`.**
