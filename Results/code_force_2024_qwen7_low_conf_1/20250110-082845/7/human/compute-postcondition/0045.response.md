The code `distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1` updates the distance of the `neighbor` in the `distances` dictionary. Given the initial state:

- `queue` is a collection with one less element than before.
- `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`.
- `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`.
- `tree[node]` must have at least one neighbor.

The line of code increments the distance of the `neighbor` by 1 compared to `current_distance`. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `distances[neighbor]` is updated to `current_distance + 1`.

Output State: **`queue` is a collection with one less element than before, `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`, and `distances[neighbor]` is updated to `current_distance + 1`.**
