The code `distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1` updates the value of `distances[neighbor]` to be the sum of `current_distance` and 1. Based on the initial state:

- `queue` is a collection with one element less than before.
- `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`.
- `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`.
- `tree[node]` must have at least one neighbor.
- The `neighbor` specified in the if condition is not in `distances`.

After the code executes, the following changes occur:
- `distances[neighbor]` is updated to `current_distance + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`queue` is a collection with one element less than before, `node` is equal to the original first element of `queue`, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`, `tree[node]` must have at least one neighbor, and the `neighbor` specified in the if condition is not in `distances`; `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`.**
