The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the value of `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. This operation does not affect the value of `distances[neighbor]`, which remains as `current_distance + 1`. The precondition that `queue` is a collection with one less element than before is updated to reflect that now `queue` has one more element.

Output State: **`queue` is a collection with one element more than before, `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`**
