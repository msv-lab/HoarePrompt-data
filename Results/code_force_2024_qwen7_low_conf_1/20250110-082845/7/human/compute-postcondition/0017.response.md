The code appends a tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` to the `operations` list. The value of `nodes_at_d[0]` is the first element of the list `nodes_at_d`, and `d` is a value from the list `nodes_at_d` since each node's distance in `distances` is equal to `d`.

After executing the code, the `operations` list will contain the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)`. The values of `max_distance`, `nodes_at_d`, and the contents of `distances` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_distance` is a non-negative integer, `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes where each node's distance in `distances` is equal to `d`, and `nodes_at_d` is not empty; `operations` contains the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)`**
