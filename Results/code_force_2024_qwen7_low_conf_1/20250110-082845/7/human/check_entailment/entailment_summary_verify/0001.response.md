Reasoning:
1. **Tree Representation**: The `func_2` function correctly constructs a tree representation from the list of edges. This part of the assessment is accurate.
2. **Distance Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the shortest path distances from a given start node (node 1 in this case) to all other nodes in the tree using BFS. This is correct and efficient for an unweighted tree. The assessment here is also accurate.
3. **Operation Planning**: The `func_2` function iterates through all possible distances from 0 to the maximum distance found. For each distance `d`, it collects all nodes that are at this distance from the starting node (node 1). However, the function only checks for non-empty `nodes_at_d` before appending to the `operations` list. While this approach ensures that only necessary operations are included, it does not necessarily minimize the number of operations. Specifically, the function could potentially color nodes at different distances in a single operation, but instead, it creates separate operations for each distance level. This may not always yield the optimal solution, as the problem statement specifies that we need to use the minimum possible number of operations.

To ensure the minimum number of operations, the function should consider combining operations when possible. For example, if there are nodes at distance `d` and nodes at distance `d+1`, they can potentially be handled in a single operation. The current implementation only ensures that all nodes at a specific distance `d` are colored in one operation, but it doesn't merge operations when possible.

Given that the function might not always produce the optimal solution due to the lack of merging operations, the correctness of the program is questionable.

Final: **False**
