Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the `func_2` function is intended to find the minimum number of operations to color all nodes black and output the sequence of operations. However, the implementation has a critical flaw.

In the `func_2` function, after calculating the distances from the root node (node 1), it attempts to group nodes by their distances and then select the nodes at the maximum distance to perform the coloring operation. This approach does not guarantee the minimum number of operations because it might choose nodes that are not necessarily the best choice for coloring the remaining uncolored nodes.

For instance, consider a tree with the following structure:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```
The distances from node 1 would be:
```
1: 0
2: 1
3: 1
4: 2
5: 2
```
Using the provided logic, the function would choose nodes at distance 2 (i.e., nodes 4 and 5) for the first operation, which is not optimal. A better strategy would be to choose node 2 or node 3 for the first operation, as they are closer to more uncolored nodes, potentially reducing the total number of operations.

Therefore, the program does not always find the minimum number of operations required to color all nodes black, making it incorrect.
