### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color all nodes in a tree black using the minimum number of operations.
   - Each operation involves choosing a node `v` and a distance `d` to color all nodes at distance `d` from `v` black.
   - The function `func_1` performs a BFS to calculate the shortest distances from a given starting node to all other nodes.
   - The function `func_2` uses the distances calculated by `func_1` to determine the minimum number of operations required and construct the sequence of operations.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` correctly implements a BFS to find the shortest path distances from a given starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - It initializes a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to store distances.
   - The BFS iterates through all reachable nodes, updating distances and adding unvisited neighbors to the queue.
   - After completing the BFS, the function returns a dictionary containing the shortest distances from the starting node to all other nodes.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree from the given edges.
   - It then calls `func_1` to get the shortest distances from node 1 to all other nodes.
   - It determines the maximum distance (`max_distance`) from node 1 to any other node.
   - For each distance `d` from 0 to `max_distance`, it collects all nodes at that distance.
   - If there are nodes at distance `d`, it appends a tuple `(node, d)` to the `operations` list.
   - Finally, it returns the length of the `operations` list and the list itself.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The core logic in both functions is correct and aligns with the problem statement.
   - `func_1` accurately computes the shortest distances.
   - `func_2` correctly identifies the nodes to color at each distance level and constructs the sequence of operations.
   - The functions handle the constraints and assumptions specified in the problem (e.g., valid tree structure, non-negative distances).

Given that both functions correctly implement their intended logic and satisfy the problem requirements, the overall program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
