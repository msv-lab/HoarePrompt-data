### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly constructs a tree representation from the list of edges. This is validated by the annotated code and the construction of the adjacency list.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the shortest path distances from a given start node (node 1 in this case) to all other nodes in the tree. This uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is correct and efficient for calculating shortest paths in an unweighted tree. The BFS ensures that the distances are computed correctly and efficiently.

3. **Operation Planning**:
   - The `func_2` function iterates through all possible distances from 0 to the maximum distance found. For each distance `d`, it collects all nodes that are at this distance from the starting node (node 1). If there are such nodes, it adds an operation to color all these nodes black. This ensures that all nodes at distance `d` are colored in one operation. However, there is a critical flaw in the operation planning logic. The function only considers nodes at each distance level, but it does not ensure that the nodes are colored in the minimum number of operations. Specifically, the function might miss optimal coloring strategies, such as using intermediate nodes to minimize the number of operations.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The function returns the number of operations needed and the sequence of operations. Each operation is represented as a tuple `(v, d)` where `v` is the node used to trigger the operation and `d` is the distance. While the format is correct, the logic behind the operations is flawed as described above.

To illustrate the flaw, consider the example given in the problem description. The tree with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4, and edges (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4):

- The `func_1` function will correctly compute the distances as `{1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}`.
- The `func_2` function will then identify that all nodes at distance 1 from node 1 (nodes 2, 3, and 4) need to be colored in one operation, leading to the operations `(2, 1)`, `(3, 1)`, and `(4, 1)`.
- However, a more optimal solution would be to color nodes 2, 3, and 4 in two operations: first color node 1 (distance 0) and then color nodes 2, 3, and 4 (distance 1).

This shows that the provided program does not always find the minimum number of operations required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not always find the minimum number of operations required to color all nodes in the tree black. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.
