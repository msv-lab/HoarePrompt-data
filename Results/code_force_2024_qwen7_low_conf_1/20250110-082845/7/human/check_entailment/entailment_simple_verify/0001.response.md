### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly constructs a tree representation from the list of edges.
   - The adjacency list `tree` is built correctly, ensuring that each node points to its neighbors.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the shortest path distances from the starting node (node 1) to all other nodes in the tree using BFS.
   - The BFS approach is correct for finding shortest paths in an unweighted tree.

3. **Operation Planning**:
   - The `func_2` function iterates through all possible distances from 0 to the maximum distance found.
   - For each distance `d`, it collects all nodes that are at this distance from the starting node (node 1).
   - If there are such nodes, it adds an operation to color all these nodes black.
   - This ensures that all nodes at distance `d` are colored in one operation.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in this approach. The plan assumes that the maximum distance will always be the optimal way to color all nodes, but it does not consider that nodes at intermediate distances might need to be processed separately to ensure all nodes are colored efficiently.

4. **Optimality Consideration**:
   - The provided solution does not necessarily minimize the number of operations. For example, consider a tree with 4 nodes arranged in a chain (1-2-3-4). The maximum distance from node 1 is 3, so the provided solution would color nodes 2 and 3 together in one operation and then node 4 in another operation, totaling 2 operations.
   - A more optimal solution would color node 2 in one operation, then node 3 in another, and finally node 4, which also totals 3 operations but is more efficient because it processes nodes sequentially rather than in batches.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The function returns the number of operations needed and the sequence of operations. Each operation is represented as a tuple `(v, d)` where `v` is the node used to trigger the operation and `d` is the distance of `v` from node 1.
   - The format is correct, but the logic to determine the optimal operations needs refinement.

### Conclusion:
While the provided code does color all nodes correctly, it does not necessarily find the minimum number of operations required. The approach taken is suboptimal in some cases, particularly when nodes are better processed in smaller batches rather than larger groups.

### Final:
Final: **False**

The program is not guaranteed to find the minimum number of operations required to color all nodes in the tree, hence it does not fully meet the problem requirements.
