Reasoning:
1. **Tree Representation**: The `func_2` function correctly constructs a tree representation from the list of edges.
2. **Distance Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the shortest path distances from a given start node (node 1 in this case) to all other nodes in the tree. This uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach which is efficient and correct for calculating shortest paths in an unweighted tree.
3. **Operation Planning**: The `func_2` function iterates through all possible distances from 0 to the maximum distance found. For each distance `d`, it collects all nodes that are at this distance from the starting node (node 1). If there are such nodes, it adds an operation to color all these nodes black. This ensures that all nodes at distance `d` are colored in one operation.
4. **Output Format**: The function returns the number of operations needed and the sequence of operations. Each operation is represented as a tuple `(v, d)` where `v` is the node used to trigger the operation and `d` is the distance.

Given that the problem description allows multiple solutions and the functions follow the logic to ensure all nodes are colored in the minimum number of operations, the provided program appears to meet the requirements specified.

Correctness: **True**
