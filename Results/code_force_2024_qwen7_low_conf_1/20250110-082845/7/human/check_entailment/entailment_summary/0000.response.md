Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of operations to color all nodes in a tree black using the minimum possible number of operations. Each operation selects a vertex and a distance to color all nodes at that distance from the selected vertex black.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate the shortest path distances from a given start node to all other nodes in the tree. This is correct and necessary for understanding the structure of the tree.
   - **func_2**: This function constructs the tree from the edges, computes the shortest distances using `func_1`, and then iterates through these distances to generate the required sequence of operations. Specifically:
     - It builds the tree from the edges.
     - It computes the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices.
     - It then collects all vertices at each distance level and creates operations to color them.
     - The logic ensures that the maximum distance found corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed because each operation covers all nodes at a specific distance level.

3. **Validation**:
   - The approach taken in `func_2` is correct because:
     - The BFS correctly computes the shortest distances from a single source (vertex 1).
     - The construction of operations to color nodes at each distance level ensures that the minimum number of operations is used.
     - The code handles all necessary edge cases, including disconnected components and ensuring that the operations cover all nodes.

Given the analysis, the implementation appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
