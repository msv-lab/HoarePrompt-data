You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a tree with n vertices numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, all
vertices are colored white.

You can perform the following two-step operation:

  1. Choose a vertex v (1 \leq v \leq n ) and a distance d (0 \leq d \leq n-1 ). 
  2. For all vertices u (1 \leq u \leq n ) such that \text{dist}^\dagger(u,v)=d , color u black. 

Construct a sequence of operations to color all the nodes in the tree black
using the minimum possible number of operations. It can be proven that it is
always possible to do so using at most n operations.

^\dagger \text{dist}(x, y) denotes the number of edges on the (unique) simple
path between vertices x and y on the tree.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 200 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^3 ) — the number of vertices of the tree.

The following n - 1 lines of each test case describe the edges of the tree.
The i -th of these lines contains two integers u_i and v_i (1 \le u_i, v_i \le
n , u_i \neq v_i ), the indices of the vertices connected by the i -th edge.

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^3 .

Output

For each test case, first output a single integer op (1 \le op \le n) , the
minimum number of operations needed to color all vertices of the tree black.

Then, output op lines, each containing 2 integers. The i -th line should
contain the values of v and d chosen for the i -th operation (1 \le v \le n ,
0 \le d \le n - 1 )

You must guarantee that at the end of op operations, all vertices are colored
black.

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    7 1
    2 1

Note

In the first test case, there is only one possible operation, and performing
it gives us a valid answer.

In the second test case, the first operation colors vertex 2 black, and the
second operation colors vertex 1 black. It can be shown that it is impossible
to color both vertices black in one operation, so the minimum number of
operations needed is 2 . Another possible solution is to use the 2 operations:
(u, r) = (1, 0) and (u, r) = (2, 0) .

In the third test case, the first operation colors vertices 2 , 3 and 4 black,
and the second operation colors vertex 1 black. Again, it can be shown that it
is impossible to color all vertices black in 1 operation, so the minimum
number of operations needed is 2 .

In the fourth test case, the first operation colors vertices 4 , 1 and 7
black, the second operation colors vertices 2 , 5 and 6 black while the third
operation colors vertices 3 and 7 black. Notice that it is allowed to color
vertex 7 black twice.

Thus, each node was marked at least once, with node 7 marked twice. It can be
shown that it is impossible to color all vertices black in fewer than 3 moves.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = 4
edges = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]
(num_operations, operations) = func_2(n, edges)
print(num_operations)
for (v, d) in operations:
    print(v, d)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where each key is a vertex (an integer) and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices (integers). start_node is an integer representing the starting vertex for the breadth-first search (BFS) operation, such that 1 <= start_node <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.
def func_1(tree, start_node):
    queue = deque([start_node])
    distances = {start_node: 0}
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        current_distance = distances[node]
        
        for neighbor in tree[node]:
            if neighbor not in distances:
                distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is an empty deque, `node` is the original `start_node`, `current_distance` is the distance from `start_node` to the farthest node in the tree, and `distances` contains the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph represented by `tree`.
    return distances
    #`The program returns distances which contains the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph represented by tree`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge connecting vertices u and v. All vertices are initially white, and the tree is guaranteed to be acyclic with n-1 edges.
def func_2(n, edges):
    tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) has a list of all vertices that are connected to it through edges in the graph represented by `edges`.
    distances = func_1(tree, 1)
    operations = []
    max_distance = max(distances.values())
    for d in range(max_distance + 1):
        nodes_at_d = [node for node, dist in distances.items() if dist == d]
        
        if nodes_at_d:
            operations.append((nodes_at_d[0], d))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_distance` is a non-negative integer, `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(node, d)` such that `node` is a node in `distances` and `d` is the distance of `node` from node 1, and `distances` retains its original values.
    return len(operations), operations
    #The program returns the length of the list 'operations' and the list 'operations' itself, where each element in 'operations' is a tuple of the form (node, d)


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
