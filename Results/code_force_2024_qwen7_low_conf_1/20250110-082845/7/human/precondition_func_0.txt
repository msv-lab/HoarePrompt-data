tree is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree where each key is a vertex (an integer) and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices (integers). start_node is an integer representing the starting vertex for the breadth-first search (BFS) operation, such that 1 <= start_node <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.
