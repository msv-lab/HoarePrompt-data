### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior with respect to the problem statement.

1. **Problem Description**: We need to distribute coins such that the total amount bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount received back from any winning outcome. This means for each \(k_i\), the sum of all bets must be less than \(k_i \times \text{(total bet)}\).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is \(\frac{\text{prod}}{r}\) for each element \(r\) in `vals`.
   - It checks if the denominator (`prod - sum(vprod)`) is positive. If it is, it prints the values in `vprod`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers.
   - It computes the list `vprod` as described.
   - It checks if the denominator is positive and prints the result accordingly.

4. **Example Input/Output Analysis**:
   - Consider the input: `3 5 5 5`
     - Product (`prod`) = \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\)
     - List `vprod` = \([25, 25, 25]\)
     - Denominator = \(125 - (25 + 25 + 25) = 0\)
     - Since the denominator is zero, it prints `-1`.

   - Consider the input: `3 3 2 7`
     - Product (`prod`) = \(3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42\)
     - List `vprod` = \([14, 21, 6]\)
     - Denominator = \(42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 1\)
     - Since the denominator is positive, it prints the list `vprod` = `[14, 21, 6]`.

   - Consider the input: `3 6 3 2`
     - Product (`prod`) = \(6 \times 3 \times 2 = 36\)
     - List `vprod` = \([6, 12, 18]\)
     - Denominator = \(36 - (6 + 12 + 18) = 0\)
     - Since the denominator is zero, it prints `-1`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies when the total bet cannot be distributed to satisfy the condition (when the denominator is zero or negative).
   - For valid cases, the program outputs a distribution of bets that ensures the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality. It checks if the total bet can be distributed such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. If not, it correctly prints `-1`.

**Final: True**
