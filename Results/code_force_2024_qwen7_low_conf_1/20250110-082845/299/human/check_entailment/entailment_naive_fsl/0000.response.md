Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then distributes the coins based on the division of `prod` by each multiplier (`vprod`). However, this approach does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
5 5 5
```

According to the problem description, the output should be `-1` because there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. However, the current implementation would incorrectly output:

```
25 25 25
```

This distribution does not satisfy the condition that the total bet must be strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
