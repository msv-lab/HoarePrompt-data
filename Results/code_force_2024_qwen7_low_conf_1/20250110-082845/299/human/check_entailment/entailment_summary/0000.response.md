Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating a distribution of bets that ensures the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the winnings for each possible outcome. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly address the requirements of the problem.

Here's the breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**: The program calculates `vprod` as `[prod // r for r in vals]`, which represents the total product of all multipliers divided by each individual multiplier. This does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet will be strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome.

2. **Denominator Check**: The program checks if `den = prod - sum(vprod)` is less than or equal to 0 and prints `-1` if true. However, even if `den > 0`, the calculated bets do not necessarily satisfy the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.

3. **Lack of Proper Solution Handling**: The program does not ensure that the sum of the calculated bets is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome. It only checks if the denominator is positive, which is not sufficient.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
