#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and k is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a non-empty list, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        return
        #None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a non-empty list, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is \(\frac{prod}{r}\) for each element \(r\) in `vals`, `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `N` and a list `vals` of `N` integers. It calculates the product of all elements in `vals` and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. If the denominator (`prod - sum(vprod)`) is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value and does not handle any edge cases explicitly other than checking if the denominator is positive.
