`ans` is assigned the value of `ans` plus `str(a[i]) + ' '`. However, the value of `a[i]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact string that is added to `ans`. But we know that `a[i]` is converted to a string and concatenated with a space. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `bets` is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `bets` must be greater than 0, `ans` is equal to the current value of `ans` plus `str(a[1]) + ' '`**
