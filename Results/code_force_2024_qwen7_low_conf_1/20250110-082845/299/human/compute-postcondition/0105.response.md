Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers from input where each element \(a[i]\) (for \(i < \text{bets}\)) is updated to \(\text{prod} // a[i]\). `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a non-empty list that must have at least \(\text{bets}\) elements, `i` is \(\text{bets}\), `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list \(a\) for the first \(\text{bets}\) indices, `g` remains the product of all elements in \(l\) divided by the GCD of all products taken pairwise, and `T` remains \(T + \text{bets}\). The sum of the first \(\text{bets}\) elements in the updated list \(a\) is greater than or equal to \(\text{prod}\).***
