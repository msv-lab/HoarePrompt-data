Given the initial state where `g` is updated to `g * l[i-1] // gcd(g, l[i-1])`, `l` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented, the code snippet provided updates `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

Let's break this down:

1. Initially, `g` is updated to `g * l[i-1] // gcd(g, l[i-1])`.
2. After that, `i` is incremented by 1.
3. Now, `g` is further updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

Since the initial value of `g` was updated using `l[i-1]`, and now `i` is incremented, `i` is now `i + 1`, which means `i` is referring to the current index in the list `l`. So, the new value of `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`
- `l` remains unchanged
- `i` is now `i + 1`

Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1`**
