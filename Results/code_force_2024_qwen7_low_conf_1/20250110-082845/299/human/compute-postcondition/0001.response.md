The code creates a list `vals` by splitting the input string into individual elements, converting each element to an integer, and storing them in the list. The initial value of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `N` is an input integer. After executing the code, `t` remains unchanged, and `N` remains unchanged, but now there is a new variable `vals` which is a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers created from the input string**
