Postcondition: **`bets` is a non-negative integer. For each index `i` in the list `a`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated values in the list `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of the string representations of the first `bets` elements of `a` separated by spaces, and `a`, `sumo`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `T`, `g`, `l`, and `bets` maintain their final values as described.**
