Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `l` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(l)` is greater than 0.
   - The code raises a `NameError` due to the undefined variable `g`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over the range of `len(l)`, meaning it will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Since `len(l)` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again if `i` (which is currently 0) is less than `len(l)`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop condition requires `i < len(l)`, and `i` starts from 0, the loop will execute again as long as `len(l)` is greater than 0.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become 1.
   - `len(l)` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Undefined Variable**:
   - The `NameError` due to the undefined variable `g` is not relevant to adjusting the loop state but indicates an issue outside the scope of the loop itself. We assume this issue will persist and does not affect the loop execution directly.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be 1.
- `len(l)` must still be greater than 0.

Thus, the updated state is:
State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1, `len(l)` is greater than 0**
