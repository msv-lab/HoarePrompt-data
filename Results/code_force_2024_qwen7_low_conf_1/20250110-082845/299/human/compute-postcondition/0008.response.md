The code multiplies the current value of `prod` by the next element `r` in the list `vals`. The initial state tells us that `prod` is the second element of `vals` multiplied by the next `r` in the list. After executing the line `prod *= r`, the value of `prod` will be updated to its previous value multiplied by `r`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `prod` is now the second element of `vals` multiplied by the next `r` in the list and this product is further multiplied by `r`**
