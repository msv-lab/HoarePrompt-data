The code `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. However, this does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `N`, `vals`, `prod`, `vprod`, and `den`. The only change is that the value `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a non-empty list, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is \(\frac{prod}{r}\) for each element \(r\) in `vals`, `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and the value `-1` is printed to the console.**
