Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `l` is a non-empty list
  - `i` is 1
  - `g` is `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(len(l)):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for each index in the range from `0` to `len(l) - 1`.

2. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Since `i` starts from 0, this means the first iteration (when `i` is 0) has already completed.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(l)`.

4. **State Update:**
   - `i` needs to be updated to 2.
   - `g` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations modifying `g` are specified.

5. **List Length:**
   - `l` remains the same since it is a non-empty list and no modifications are mentioned.

### Updated State
- `i` is now 2.
- `g` remains the same (`g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`).
- `l` remains the same (a non-empty list).

### Final Answer
State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 2, `g` is `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`**
