According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range of the length of the list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` remains unchanged, and `i` remains unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The value of `i` will increment by 1 because the loop is iterating over the range of `len(l)`.
2. Since `i` is incremented, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Given that `i` was unchanged at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the original value of `i` as `original_i`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `original_i + 1`.

The list `l` remains unchanged, and the value of `g` is updated based on the previous iteration's value of `i`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and maintain the unchanged values of `g` and `l`.

State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[original_i] // gcd(g, l[original_i])`, `l` is unchanged, and `i` is unchanged + 1**. 

To generalize it without knowing the exact value of `original_i`, we can say:

State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i-1] // gcd(g, l[i-1])`, `l` is unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

So the final state is:
State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i-1] // gcd(g, l[i-1])`, `l` is unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
