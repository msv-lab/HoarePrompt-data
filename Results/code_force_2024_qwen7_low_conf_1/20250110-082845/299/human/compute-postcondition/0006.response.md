The code `prod *= r` multiplies the value of `prod` by `r`. Given the initial state, `prod` is the second element of the list `vals`. Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we will denote it as `r`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `prod` initially holds the second element of the list `vals`.
2. The operation `prod *= r` means `prod` is updated to `prod * r`.

Since the exact value of `r` is not specified, we will represent the new value of `prod` as `prod * r`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `prod` is now the second element of `vals` multiplied by `r`**
