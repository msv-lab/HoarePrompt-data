`sumo` is incremented by `int(a[i])`. The value of `a[i]` was previously used to update `prod // a[i]` and `sumo + int(a[i])`, so the new value of `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo + int(a[i])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + int(a[i])] + int(a[i])`**
