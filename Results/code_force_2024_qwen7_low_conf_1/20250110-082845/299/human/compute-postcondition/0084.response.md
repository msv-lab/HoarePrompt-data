The code snippet `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` updates the value of `g`. However, the initial value of `g` is not provided. Let's assume `g` initially holds a value `g_val`. The value of `i` is 1, so `l[i]` refers to the second element in the list `l`. 

Let's denote the second element of the list `l` as `l[1]`. The updated value of `g` will be `g_val * l[1] // gcd(g_val, l[1])`.

Given the initial state:
- `l` is a non-empty list,
- `i` is 1,
- `len(l)` is greater than 0.

After executing the code, the updated value of `g` is `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1, `g` is `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`**
