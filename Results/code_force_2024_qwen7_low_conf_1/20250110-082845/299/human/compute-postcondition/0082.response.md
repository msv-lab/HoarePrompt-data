The initial state includes that `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, and `len(l)` is greater than 0. The line of code `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` is attempting to update the value of `g`. However, the variable `g` is not defined in the initial state, and there is no way to infer its initial value from the given information.

Given this, the code will raise a NameError because `g` is not defined. Since the problem requires providing the output state based on the initial state and the changes made by the code, and since the code cannot run due to the undefined variable, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `len(l)` is greater than 0, and the code raises a NameError due to the undefined variable `g`.**
