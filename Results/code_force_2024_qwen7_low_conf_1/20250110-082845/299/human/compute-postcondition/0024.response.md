`a[i]` is reassigned the value of `prod // a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` was previously updated to `prod // a[i]` in the initial state, but now it gets the same calculation again. The states of the other variables (`bets`, `sumo`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + int(a[i])`**
