`g` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `g` is now `1`, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` has been updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated values in the list `a`, `t` is the original value, `k`, `g` is `1`, `l`, and `bets` maintain their final values, and `T` is incremented by 1.
