`vprod` is assigned a list comprehension where each element is calculated as `(prod // r)` for each element `r` in `vals`. This means that for each element `r` in `vals`, the corresponding element in `vprod` will be the product of all elements in `vals` divided by `r`.

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `N` remains an input integer (its value is not affected by this operation).
- `vals` is a non-empty list.
- `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.

After executing the code, `vprod` will be a list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a non-empty list, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is \(\frac{prod}{r}\) for each element \(r\) in `vals`.**
