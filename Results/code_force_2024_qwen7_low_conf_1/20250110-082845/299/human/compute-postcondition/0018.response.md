Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `N` and a list `vals` of `N` integers. It calculates the product of all elements in `vals` and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. If the denominator (`prod - sum(vprod)`) is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value and does not handle any edge cases explicitly other than checking if the denominator is positive.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code, including the calculation of the product and the subsequent operations on the list `vals`. It also notes that the function does not handle any explicit edge cases beyond checking if the denominator is positive.
