Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` (i.e., `g = l[0] * l[1] * ... * l[len(l) - 1] // gcd of all products taken pairwise), `len(l)` is the length of `l`.** 

Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Variables:**
   - `l` is a non-empty list.
   - `g` starts with an initial value of 1 (`g = 1`).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`.
   - For each iteration `i`, `g` is updated by multiplying `g` with `l[i]` and dividing by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`.

3. **After All Iterations:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `len(l) - 1` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `len(l) - 1`.
   - `g` will be the product of all elements in `l` after applying the gcd operation pairwise. This means:
     - Initially, `g = 1`.
     - For each `i` from 0 to `len(l) - 1`, `g` is updated as follows:
       - First iteration: `g = g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])` (which simplifies to `g = l[0]` since `g` starts as 1).
       - Second iteration: `g = g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])` (which simplifies to `g = l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`).
       - Third iteration: `g = g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])` (which simplifies to `g = l[0] * l[1] * l[2] // gcd(l[0] * l[1], l[2])`).
     - Continuing this process, after `len(l)` iterations, `g` will be the product of all elements in `l` divided by the gcd of all products taken pairwise.

4. **No Iteration Case:**
   - If the list `l` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `g` remains 1.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the output state is that `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` after applying the gcd operation pairwise, and `len(l)` is the length of `l`.
