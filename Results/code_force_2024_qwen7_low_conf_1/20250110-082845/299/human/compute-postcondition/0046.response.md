According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop condition is `i < len(l)`. At the end of the last iteration, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` remains unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(l)`.

Since `i` was incremented from its previous value (let's call it `i_prev`) to `i_prev + 1`, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1` and `i + 1` must still be less than `len(l)`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is `i_prev + 1` and `i + 1` is less than `len(l)`.

State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than `len(l)`**
