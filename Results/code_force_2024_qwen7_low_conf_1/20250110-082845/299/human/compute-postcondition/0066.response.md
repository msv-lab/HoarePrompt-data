Postcondition: **`a` is a list where each element is `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a`. `t` is the original value, `k`, `g`, and `l` maintain their final values, `bets` maintains its final value, `T` is incremented by `bets`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, and `bets` is greater than or equal to 0**.
