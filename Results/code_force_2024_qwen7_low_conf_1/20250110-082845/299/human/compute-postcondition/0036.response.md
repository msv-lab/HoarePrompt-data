The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. The initial state tells us that `bets` is greater than 0 and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. After executing the code, `ans` will be updated accordingly.

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we represent it as `a[i]` in the output state. The condition that `bets` is greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space**
