To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and consider what the loop requires.

### Given Information:
1. `a` is a list where each element is `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
2. `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
3. `t` is the original value (not relevant to the loop).
4. `k`, `g`, and `l` maintain their final values (not relevant to the loop).
5. `bets` maintains its final value (not relevant to the loop).
6. `T` is incremented by `bets` and is now `T + bets`.
7. `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in the list `a`.
8. `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.
9. `bets` is greater than or equal to 0.
10. `g` is 1.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the indices of the list `l`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **List `l`:**
   - The loop will iterate over the indices of `l`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is a non-empty list (since an empty list would result in no iterations).

2. **Index `i`:**
   - The loop variable `i` will take values from `0` to `len(l) - 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts from `0` (the first index) and that `len(l)` is greater than `0`.

3. **Relevant States:**
   - `l` should be a non-empty list.
   - `i` should start from `0`.
   - `len(l)` should be greater than `0`.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `len(l)` is greater than 0**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing as required.
