The code snippet takes input and splits it into a list of integers, which is assigned to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` from its previous undefined state to a list of integers derived from the input.

The initial state provides details about `bets`, `l`, `i`, `g`, `T`, `prod`, and `sumo`. However, these variables remain unchanged by the code snippet provided.

Let's summarize the changes and the unaffected variables:

- `a` is updated to a list of integers derived from the input.
- All other variables (`bets`, `l`, `i`, `g`, `T`, `prod`, `sumo`) remain as per their initial states.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from input, `bets` is the input integer, `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` // gcd of all products taken pairwise, `T` is `T + bets`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, and `bets` is greater than or equal to 0.**
