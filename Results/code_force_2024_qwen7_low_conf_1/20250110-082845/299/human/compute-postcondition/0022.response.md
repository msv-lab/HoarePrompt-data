`sumo` is updated by adding `int(a[i])` to its current value. The value of `a[i]` remains unchanged, and `bets` is still greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `bets` is greater than 1, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + int(a[i])`.

Output State: **`bets` is greater than 1, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + int(a[i])`**
