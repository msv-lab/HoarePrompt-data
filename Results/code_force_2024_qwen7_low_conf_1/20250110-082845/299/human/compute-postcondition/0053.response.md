The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This means the list `a` will now contain the integers entered by the user. The other variables (`sumo`, `t`, `k`, `g`, `l`, `bets`, and `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is the integer value of the user's input, `a` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `sumo` is the sum of all updated values in the list `a`, `t` is the original value, `k`, `g`, `l`, and `bets` maintain their final values, and `T` is incremented by 1.**
