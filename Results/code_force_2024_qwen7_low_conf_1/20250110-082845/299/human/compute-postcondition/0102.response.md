`a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `a[3]` is updated to `prod // a[3]`. The values of the other variables (`a[0]`, `a[1]`, `bets`, `l`, `i`, and `sumo`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`; `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`; `bets` is an integer greater than 0; `l` is a non-empty list that must have at least `bets` elements; `i` is 4; `sumo` is `a[1] + int(a[2]); a[3]` is `prod // a[3]`**
