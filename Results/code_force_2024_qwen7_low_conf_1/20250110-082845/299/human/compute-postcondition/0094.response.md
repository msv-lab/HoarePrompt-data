`sumo` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `sumo` is now `0`, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers from input, `bets` is the input integer, `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` // gcd of all products taken pairwise, `T` is `T + bets`, `prod` is the LCM of all integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is `0`, and `bets` is greater than or equal to `0`.
