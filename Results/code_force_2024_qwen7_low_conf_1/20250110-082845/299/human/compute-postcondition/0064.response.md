`sumo` is incremented by `int(a[i])`. Since `i` is 4, `a[i]` refers to `a[4]`. From the initial state, `a[4]` is `prod // a[4]`.

Given this, `sumo` becomes `prod // a[0] + a[3] + (prod // a[4])`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `a[0]` remains `prod // a[0]`
- `a[1]` remains unchanged
- `a[2]` remains unchanged
- `a[3]` remains unchanged
- `a[4]` remains `prod // a[4]`
- `sumo` becomes `prod // a[0] + a[3] + (prod // a[4])`
- `t` remains the original value
- `k`, `g`, and `l` maintain their final values
- `bets` maintains its final value
- `T` is incremented by 1
- `prod` remains the least common multiple of all integers in the list `a`
- `bets` must be greater than 3
- `i` becomes 5

Output State: **`a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is unchanged, `a[2]` is unchanged, `a[3]` is unchanged, `a[4]` is `prod // a[4]`, `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + a[3] + (prod // a[4])`, `t` is the original value, `k`, `g`, and `l` maintain their final values, `bets` maintains its final value, `T` is incremented by 1, `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in the list `a`, `bets` must be greater than 3, `i` is 5**
