The code `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans` but does not change the value of `ans` itself. The value of `i` is `bets - 1`, and `bets` is a positive integer. The value of `ans` is the concatenation of `str(a[j]) + ' '` for all `j` from `0` to `bets - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State remains as follows:

Output State: **`i` is `bets - 1`, `bets` is a positive integer, `ans` is the concatenation of `str(a[j]) + ' '` for all `j` from `0` to `bets - 1`.**
