The code `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `sumo` and `a[i]`, we will keep the expressions as they are.

The output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + int(a[i])`**
