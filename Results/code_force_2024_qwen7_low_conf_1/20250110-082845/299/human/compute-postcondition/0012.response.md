Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a non-empty list, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is \(\frac{prod}{r}\) for each element \(r\) in `vals`, `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`. The value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.***
