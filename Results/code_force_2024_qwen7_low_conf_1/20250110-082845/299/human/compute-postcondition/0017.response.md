The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters as shown (it only has the function definition without any parameters listed). However, based on the constraints provided, it processes multiple test cases internally, where for each test case:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\), and `k` is a list of `n` integers where \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).

Since the function does not return anything (`None` is mentioned), there are no return values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process multiple test cases with the given constraints without returning any value.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with a positive integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, a positive integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) and a list `k` of `n` integers where \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\), without returning any value.**
