The given code snippet `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` modifies the value of `g` based on its current value and the value of `l[i]`. However, without knowing the initial values of `g` and `l[i]`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `g`. We can only say that `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the code, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is unchanged, and `i` is unchanged.**
