The code `sumo += int(a[i])` updates `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 4, this means `sumo` is updated by adding `int(a[4])`.

The initial state provides that `sumo` is equal to `a[1] + int(a[2])`. After executing the code, `sumo` will be updated to `a[1] + int(a[2]) + int(a[4])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`; `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`; `bets` is an integer greater than 0; `l` is a non-empty list that must have at least `bets` elements; `i` is 4; `sumo` is `a[1] + int(a[2]) + int(a[4]); a[3]` is `prod // a[3]`**
