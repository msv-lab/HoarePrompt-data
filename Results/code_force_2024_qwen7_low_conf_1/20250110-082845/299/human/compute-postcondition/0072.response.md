According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `bets`. For the loop to execute again, `bets` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is undefined.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. For the loop to continue executing, `bets` must remain greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1
- `bets` must still be greater than 0
- `ans` remains undefined

State: **`i` is 1, `bets` must be greater than 0, `ans` is undefined**
