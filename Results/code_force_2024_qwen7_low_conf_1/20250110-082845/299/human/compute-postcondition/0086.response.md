The code updates the value of `g` by multiplying it with `l[i]` divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `l` is a non-empty list
- `i` is 2
- `g` is calculated as `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`

First, let's calculate the initial value of `g`:

\[ g = g * l[1] // \text{gcd}(g, l[1]) \]

Since the initial value of `g` is not specified, let's denote it as `g_initial`.

Then, the code updates `g` as follows:

\[ g = g_{\text{initial}} * l[2] // \text{gcd}(g_{\text{initial}} * l[1] // \text{gcd}(g_{\text{initial}}, l[1]), l[2]) \]

This means `g` is updated to the product of its previous value and `l[2]`, divided by the gcd of the previous value of `g` and `l[2]`.

So, the final state of the variables is:

- `l` is a non-empty list
- `i` is 2
- `g` is updated to \( g_{\text{initial}} * l[2] // \text{gcd}(g_{\text{initial}} * l[1] // \text{gcd}(g_{\text{initial}}, l[1]), l[2]) \)

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 2, `g` is updated to \( g_{\text{initial}} * l[2] // \text{gcd}(g_{\text{initial}} * l[1] // \text{gcd}(g_{\text{initial}}, l[1]), l[2]) \)**
