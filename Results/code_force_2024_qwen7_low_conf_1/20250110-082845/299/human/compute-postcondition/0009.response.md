Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a non-empty list, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `r` in the list `vals`.
- On each iteration, `prod` is updated by multiplying the current value of `prod` with the current element `r`.
- After all elements in `vals` have been processed, `prod` will hold the product of all elements in `vals`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `vals` is an empty list), the value of `prod` remains as its initial value, which is 1.
