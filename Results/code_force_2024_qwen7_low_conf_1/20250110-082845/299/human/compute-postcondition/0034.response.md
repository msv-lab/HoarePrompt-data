The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. Since the initial state of `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[i+1]` followed by a space, the value of `a[i+1]` is now part of `ans`. The value of `ans` is modified, but the condition that `bets` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space**
