The code snippet `print('NO')` does not affect any variables; it only prints the string 'NO'. The other variables (`i`, `bullets`, `n`, and `last_pos`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 2; `bullets` is `k * (x[0] + x[2] - 2 * x[1]) - a[0] - a[1] - a[2]`; `n` is greater than 0; `last_pos` is `x[2]`; print('NO')**
