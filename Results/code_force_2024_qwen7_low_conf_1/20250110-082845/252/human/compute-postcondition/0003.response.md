According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `t` was initially between 1 and 3⋅10^4, it will still be greater than 0 unless the loop body has somehow modified `t` to be 0 or less. Given no information about modifications within the loop body, we can assume that `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4, t must be greater than 0**
