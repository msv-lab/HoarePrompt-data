The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates the exit from the loop or the current block of code. Therefore, the values of `bullets` and `last_pos` remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.

Output State: **`bullets` is `bullets - a[i]`, `last_pos` is `x[i]'**
