`my_power` is incremented by `k`. The initial value of `my_power` is `n - put_all_on_right[1]`. Since `k` is added to `my_power`, the new value of `my_power` becomes `(n - put_all_on_right[1]) + k`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to (n - put_all_on_right[1]) + k**
