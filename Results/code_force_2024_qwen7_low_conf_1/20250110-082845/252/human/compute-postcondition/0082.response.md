`bullets` is updated by subtracting `a[i]` from its current value. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `bullets -= a[i]` implies that `bullets` is decreased by `a[3]`. The value of `a[3]` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains as `a[3]`. The other variables (`i`, `bullets`, `k`, `x[3]`, and `last_pos`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `bullets` is `bullets - a[3]`; `last_pos` is `x[3]`**
