The function `func_1()` is called, but its implementation is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact changes it will make to the variables. However, we know that `t` is an input integer with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4 and t > 1.

Since the function `func_1()` is called and its behavior is not specified, we can only state that `t` remains an input integer within the given range, and the function might have modified other variables or performed some operations.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer with 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4 and t > 1; the function `func_1()` has been called.**
