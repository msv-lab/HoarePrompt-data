The variable `last_pos` is assigned the value of `x[i]`. The value of `bullets` is increased by `k * (x[i] - last_pos)`, but since `last_pos` is now `x[i]`, the term `(x[i] - last_pos)` evaluates to 0. Therefore, the value of `bullets` does not change.

Output State: **`bullets` is increased by `k * (x[i] - last_pos)` which results in no change, `last_pos` is equal to `x[i]`**
