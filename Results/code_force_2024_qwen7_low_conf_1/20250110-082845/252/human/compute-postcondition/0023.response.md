The code `my_power -= put_all_on_right[i]` subtracts the value of `put_all_on_right[i]` from `my_power`. Given that `i` is 2, `my_power` was initially defined as `(n - put_all_on_right[2]) + k`, and `n` is a positive integer, we need to update `my_power` accordingly.

Let's break this down:

1. Initially, `my_power` is defined as: `my_power = (n - put_all_on_right[2]) + k`.
2. After executing `my_power -= put_all_on_right[i]`, the new value of `my_power` will be: `my_power = (n - put_all_on_right[2]) + k - put_all_on_right[2]`.

Simplifying the expression, we get: `my_power = (n - 2*put_all_on_right[2]) + k`.

Since the condition `if my_power < put_all_on_right[i]` does not return anything, the values of `i`, `n`, `my_power`, and `k` remain unchanged except for the updated value of `my_power`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to `(n - 2*put_all_on_right[2]) + k`, and `k` remains unchanged.**
