According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop iterates `t` times. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer with 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4 and t > 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 (since we are already in the t-1th iteration). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1, making it `t - 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer with 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4 and t > 1**
