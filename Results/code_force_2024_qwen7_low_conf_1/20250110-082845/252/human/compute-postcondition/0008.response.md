The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition but appears to operate on predefined lists `a` and `x` and an integer `t`. 

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- The list `a` contains `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- The list `x` contains `n` integers such that \(-n \leq x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_n \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq 0\).

Based on the provided cases:

Case_1: If the conditions specified by `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` do not match the given constraints, the function returns an appropriate error message or handling for invalid input.
Case_2: After validating the inputs, the function processes the lists `a` and `x` according to some unspecified logic and returns a result.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept predefined lists `a` and `x`, and an integer `t`, validate the inputs against given constraints, and return a result based on the processed lists and integer `t`.

Functionality: **The function accepts predefined lists `a` and `x`, and an integer `t`. It validates the inputs against given constraints and returns a result based on the processed lists and integer `t`.**
