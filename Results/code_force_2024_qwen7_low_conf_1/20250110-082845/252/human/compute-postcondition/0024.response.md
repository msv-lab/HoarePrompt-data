`my_power` is incremented by `k`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, and `k` remains unchanged. The initial value of `my_power` is `(n - 2 * put_all_on_right[2]) + k`. After executing `my_power += k`, the value of `my_power` becomes `(n - 2 * put_all_on_right[2]) + k + k`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to `(n - 2 * put_all_on_right[2]) + 2k`, and `k` remains unchanged.**
