Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4. The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which typically indicates that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

2. **Determine the Initial State Needed for the Loop**: For the loop to execute, the variable `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range. Specifically, `t` must be at least 1 (since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`, meaning `t` should be greater than or equal to 1).

3. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop requires `t` to be a positive integer within the given range, we need to ensure that the initial value of `t` meets this requirement.

Based on these steps, the state before the loop needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4**
