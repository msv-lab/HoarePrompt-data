The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: A positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k`: A positive integer where \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `v`: A list of positive integers representing the health points of \(n\) monsters.
- `x`: A sorted list of distinct integers representing the positions of these \(n\) monsters on a line, where \(-n \leq x_i < x_{i+1} \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq 0\).

Based on the given cases, the function does not return anything in any of the scenarios.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, `v`, and `x` and perform some operation without returning any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `v`, and `x` and does not return any value.**
