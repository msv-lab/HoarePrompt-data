The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `my_power`, and `k` remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to \((n - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \text{put_all_on_right}[j]) + nk\), and `k` remains unchanged.**
