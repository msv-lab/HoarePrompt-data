The code `last_pos = x[i]` assigns the value of `x[i]` to the variable `last_pos`. The previous value of `i` is 0, so `last_pos` is now equal to `x[0]`. The values of `i`, `bullets`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `bullets` is `k * (x[0] - last_pos)'; `n` must be greater than 0; `last_pos` is `x[0]`**
