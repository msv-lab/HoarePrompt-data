`bullets` is decremented by `a[i]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `a[i]` is `a[0]`. The initial value of `bullets` is `k * (x[0] - last_pos)`. After executing the line `bullets -= a[i]`, the new value of `bullets` is `k * (x[0] - last_pos) - a[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `bullets` is `k * (x[0] - last_pos) - a[0]; `n` must be greater than 0; `last_pos` is `x[0]`**
