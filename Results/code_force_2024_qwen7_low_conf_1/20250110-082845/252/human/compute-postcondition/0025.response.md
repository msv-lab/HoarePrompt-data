Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `my_power` is equal to \((n - 2 \times \text{put_all_on_right}[2]) + 2k\)
   - `k` remains unchanged

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Current Iteration**: Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue to the next iteration if `i < n`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

5. **States to Adjust**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` remains the same as it is a positive integer and does not change within the loop.
   - `my_power` and `k` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop iteration itself.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is a positive integer
- `my_power` is equal to \((n - 2 \times \text{put_all_on_right}[2]) + 2k\)
- `k` remains unchanged

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to \((n - 2 \times \text{put_all_on_right}[2]) + 2k\), and `k` remains unchanged**
