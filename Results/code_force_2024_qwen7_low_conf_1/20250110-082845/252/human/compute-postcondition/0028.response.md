Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to \((n - 2 \times \text{put_all_on_right}[2]) + 2k\), and `k` remains unchanged. If `my_power` is less than \(\text{put_all_on_right}[i]\), then the function does not return any value. Otherwise, the function also does not return any value.***
