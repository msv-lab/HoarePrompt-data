`bullets` is updated by adding `k * (x[i] - last_pos)` to its current value. The previous value of `bullets` was `bullets + k * (x[j+1] - x[j]) - a[j+1]`, and `last_pos` is now `x[j+1]`. The value of `i` is used in the calculation, but its specific value is not given, so we keep it as `i`.

Output State: **`bullets` is `bullets + k * (x[j+1] - x[j]) - a[j+1] + k * (x[i] - last_pos)`, `last_pos` is `x[j+1]`**
