Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
     - `bullets` is decreased by `a[i]` from its previous value of `bullets + k * (x[i] - last_pos)`.
     - `last_pos` is equal to `x[i]`.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, if the current `i` is `j`, the next `i` will be `j+1`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - For the next iteration, we need to update the values of `bullets` and `last_pos` based on the new `i`.
   - The formula for updating `bullets` is `bullets + k * (x[i] - last_pos) - a[i]`.
   - The new `last_pos` will be `x[i+1]`.

4. **Consider the Conditions for Loop Continuation:**
   - If `bullets` becomes less than 0, the loop will break, and a message 'NO' will be printed.

Given this information, let's state the updated conditions for the next iteration:

- Assume the current `i` is `j`, then the next `i` will be `j+1`.
- The new `last_pos` will be `x[j+1]`.
- The new value of `bullets` will be `bullets + k * (x[j+1] - x[j]) - a[j+1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`bullets` is `bullets + k * (x[j+1] - x[j]) - a[j+1]`, `last_pos` is `x[j+1]`**
