The `print('NO')` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `my_power`, or `k`. It simply prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to \((n - 2 \times \text{put_all_on_right}[2]) + 2k\), and `k` remains unchanged**
