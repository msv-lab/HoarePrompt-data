Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `my_power` is equal to `(n - put_all_on_right[1]) + k`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop runs from `i` starting at 1 up to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts at 1, at the end of the first iteration, `i` would be incremented to 2.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is now 2, `i < n + 1` must hold true.

5. **Modifying the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `my_power` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`. Specifically, `my_power` will be `(n - put_all_on_right[i]) + k`, where `i` is now 2.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `my_power` is now `(n - put_all_on_right[2]) + k`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to `(n - put_all_on_right[2]) + k`**.
