Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `v`, and `x`. It reads these values from input where `n` and `k` are positive integers, `v` is a list of positive integers representing the health points of `n` monsters, and `x` is a sorted list of distinct integers representing the positions of these monsters on a line. The function calculates whether it is possible to defeat all monsters starting with `k` initial power points. It does this by iterating through the positions of the monsters, updating the power based on the total health points of the monsters at each position, and checking if the current power is sufficient to defeat the monsters at that position. If the power becomes insufficient at any point, the function prints 'NO' and returns immediately. If the function successfully iterates through all the monsters without running out of power, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that `v` and `x` are of length `n`. If the lengths do not match, the function would encounter an error. This should be handled appropriately.
- The function also assumes that the input values are valid (positive integers for `n` and `k`, and non-negative integers for `v`). There should be input validation to ensure these conditions are met.
- The function does not handle the case where `k` is zero. In such a scenario, the function would immediately print 'NO' since it is impossible to defeat any monster.
- The function does not explicitly check for the possibility of running out of power before reaching the last monster. If the power is not sufficient even after the last iteration, the function should print 'NO'.
