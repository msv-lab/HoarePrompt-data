The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but uses the following inputs:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- There are two lists `a` and `x`, where `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), and `x` is a list of `n` integers such that \(-n \leq x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_n \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq 0\).

The output of the function depends on the internal logic applied to these inputs. Based on the given cases and relationships, the function will return one of the following:
- Case_1: An integer result based on the processing of the inputs.
- Case_2: A string result based on the processing of the inputs.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a set of predefined inputs (including `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) and return either an integer or a string based on the specified conditions and internal logic. 

Functionality: **The function accepts predefined inputs including an integer `t`, integers `n` and `k`, and two lists `a` and `x`, and returns either an integer or a string based on the specified conditions and internal logic.**
