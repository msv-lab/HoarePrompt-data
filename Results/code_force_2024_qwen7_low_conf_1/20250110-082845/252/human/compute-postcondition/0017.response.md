`my_power` is decremented by the value of `put_all_on_right[i]`. The initial value of `i` is 1, so `put_all_on_right[1]` is subtracted from `my_power`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to its original value minus `put_all_on_right[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to its original value minus `put_all_on_right[1]`**
