The code `print('NO')` does not affect any variable's value; it only prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the initial values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `bullets` is `k * (x[0] - last_pos) - a[0] + k * (x[1] - last_pos) - a[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, and `last_pos` is `x[1]`, print output is 'NO'**
