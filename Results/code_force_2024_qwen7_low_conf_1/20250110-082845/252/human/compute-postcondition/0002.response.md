The function `func_1()` is called, but its implementation is not provided. Since there is no information about what `func_1()` does, the only thing we can conclude is that the function might modify the value of `t` or perform some operation involving `t`. However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_1()`, we cannot determine the new value of `t`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the value of `t` unless `func_1()` alters it. Since we don't know what `func_1()` does, we assume that `t` retains its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4**
