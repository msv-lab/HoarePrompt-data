The function `func_1()` is called, but its implementation is not provided in the given code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine what changes it might make to the variables. The only thing we know is that `t` is an input integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4, and it must be greater than 0. Since no specific operations are performed within `func_1()`, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer with 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4 and t > 0**
