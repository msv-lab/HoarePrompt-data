The code prints 'NO', but it does not affect any of the variables. The values of `i`, `n`, and `my_power` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to `(n - put_all_on_right[2]) + k`, and the program prints 'NO'.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to `(n - put_all_on_right[2]) + k', and the program prints 'NO'**.
