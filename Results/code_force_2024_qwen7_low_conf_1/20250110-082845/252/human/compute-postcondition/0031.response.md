Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to \((n - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \text{put_all_on_right}[j]) + nk\), and `k` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop continues to execute as long as `my_power` is greater than or equal to `put_all_on_right[i]`. This means that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`.

2. **Final Iteration**: When the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n`. At this point, the condition `my_power < put_all_on_right[n]` will no longer be true, meaning the loop will terminate.

3. **Calculation of `my_power`**:
   - Initially, `my_power` is set to `k`.
   - For each iteration \( j \) from 1 to \( n-1 \), `my_power` is updated as follows:
     - Decreased by `put_all_on_right[j]`.
     - Increased by `k`.

4. **Summation**:
   - The total decrease in `my_power` over all iterations is \(\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \text{put_all_on_right}[j]\).
   - After \( n-1 \) iterations, `my_power` is adjusted by adding \( nk \).

5. **Final Value of `my_power`**:
   - Therefore, the final value of `my_power` will be \( k - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \text{put_all_on_right}[j] + nk \).
   - Simplifying, we get: \( (n - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \text{put_all_on_right}[j]) + nk \).

Thus, after the loop has finished executing, the final values of the variables are:
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `my_power` is \((n - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \text{put_all_on_right}[j]) + nk\).
- `k` remains unchanged.
