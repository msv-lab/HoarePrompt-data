Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game mechanics as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters is flawed.

1. **Misunderstanding the Problem**: The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the player can always neutralize the monsters' combined health within one second by simply shooting `k` bullets. However, the key challenge is ensuring that no monster reaches the player's position (point 0) before being killed.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The variable `put_all_on_right` is used to store the total health of monsters on the right side of the player for each distance from the player. This approach does not account for the dynamic movement of monsters towards the player. The logic to check if the player can survive and kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's position is not implemented correctly.

3. **Example Case When It Fails**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   1
   2 1
   1 1
   -1 1
   ```
   - The player can only shoot 1 bullet per second, and there are 2 monsters, each with 1 health point.
   - In the first second, the player can shoot one of the monsters, but the other monster will still move closer to the player.
   - By the second second, both monsters will reach the player's position simultaneously, resulting in a loss.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
