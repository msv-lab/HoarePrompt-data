### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by arrays `v` and `x`.
   - The program uses `func_1()` to handle each test case.

2. **Logic in `func_1()`:**
   - It initializes an array `put_all_on_right` where `put_all_on_right[abs(x[i])] += v[i]` for each monster.
   - This array essentially keeps track of the total damage each point from 1 to n+1 can receive from monsters.
   - The variable `my_power` starts with `k` and iterates through the array `put_all_on_right`. 
   - For each point, it checks if the current `my_power` is less than the damage required to neutralize all monsters at that point. If it is, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - Otherwise, it subtracts the damage from `my_power` and then adds back `k` to simulate the replenishment of bullets.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic seems to follow the rules of the game closely.
   - It correctly calculates the total damage required at each point and ensures the player can survive.
   - The approach of calculating cumulative damage for each point is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic and logic flow as described in the problem statement.
- The program handles all the constraints and examples provided.

**Correctness: True**
