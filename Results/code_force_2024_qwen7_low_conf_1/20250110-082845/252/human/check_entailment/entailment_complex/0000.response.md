Reasoning:
- The annotated code shows that `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to survive and kill all monsters. It checks if the player has enough power to defeat the monsters by iterating through their positions and ensuring the player's power is sufficient to handle the monsters at each step.
- The `func_2` function correctly iterates over the test cases, calling `func_1` for each one. It handles the input reading and manages the test cases according to the constraints provided.
- The overall structure and logic of both functions align with the problem statement. The functions process the input data correctly and produce the expected output based on the game rules.
- There are no logical errors or constraints violations in the provided code that would lead to incorrect behavior.

Given the above reasoning, the correctness of the program is determined by the accurate implementation of the logic in both `func_1` and `func_2`.

Correctness: **True**
