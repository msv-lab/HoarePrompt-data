You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    put_all_on_right = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        put_all_on_right[abs(x[i])] += v[i]
    my_power = k
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if my_power < put_all_on_right[i]:
            print('NO')
            return
        my_power -= put_all_on_right[i]
        my_power += k
    print('YES')

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2()` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on predefined lists `a` and `x`, and an integer `t` which is expected to be an input. It iterates `t` times, executing the function `func_1()` in each iteration. After the loop, it does not return any value. The function ensures that `t` is within the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \times 10^4\). If `t` is invalid, the function will still proceed but will ignore the invalid input. The function also assumes that `func_1()` processes the lists `a` and `x` in each iteration. However, the function does not validate the contents of the lists `a` and `x` against their respective constraints (i.e., \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(-n \leq x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_n \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq 0\)). Therefore, the function does not ensure these constraints are met.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game mechanics as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters is flawed.

1. **Misunderstanding the Problem**: The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the player can always neutralize the monsters' combined health within one second by simply shooting `k` bullets. However, the key challenge is ensuring that no monster reaches the player's position (point 0) before being killed.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The variable `put_all_on_right` is used to store the total health of monsters on the right side of the player for each distance from the player. This approach does not account for the dynamic movement of monsters towards the player. The logic to check if the player can survive and kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's position is not implemented correctly.

3. **Example Case When It Fails**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   1
   2 1
   1 1
   -1 1
   ```
   - The player can only shoot 1 bullet per second, and there are 2 monsters, each with 1 health point.
   - In the first second, the player can shoot one of the monsters, but the other monster will still move closer to the player.
   - By the second second, both monsters will reach the player's position simultaneously, resulting in a loss.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
