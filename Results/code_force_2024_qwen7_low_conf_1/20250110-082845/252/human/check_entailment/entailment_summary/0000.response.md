Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if a player can survive and kill all monsters without any reaching the player's position.
- The `func_1` function correctly implements the logic to check if it's possible to defeat all monsters:
  - It reads `n` (number of monsters), `k` (initial power), `v` (health points of monsters), and `x` (positions of monsters).
  - It calculates the total health points at each position and checks if the player can handle these points with available power.
  - If the player runs out of power at any point, it returns 'NO'.
  - If the player can handle all monsters, it returns 'YES'.
- The `func_2` function correctly iterates over the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- Both functions adhere to the input and output specifications provided in the problem statement.
- There are no apparent issues with the logic or constraints handled by these functions.

Correctness: **True**
