You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. v is a list of positive integers representing the health points of n monsters, and x is a sorted list of distinct integers representing the positions of these n monsters on a line, where -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    put_all_on_right = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        put_all_on_right[abs(x[i])] += v[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `v` is a list of integers read from input, `x` is a list of integers read from input, for every index `i` in range `n`, `put_all_on_right[abs(x[i])]` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is `n`.
    my_power = k
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if my_power < put_all_on_right[i]:
            print('NO')
            return
        
        my_power -= put_all_on_right[i]
        
        my_power += k
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `my_power` is equal to \((n - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \text{put_all_on_right}[j]) + nk\), and `k` remains unchanged.
    print('YES')

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^9. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the list x contains n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an input integer with 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4 and `t` is greater than the number of iterations of the loop minus one; the function `func_1()` has been called `t` times.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
