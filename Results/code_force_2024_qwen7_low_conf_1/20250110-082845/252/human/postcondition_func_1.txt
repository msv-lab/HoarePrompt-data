The function `func_2()` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on predefined lists `a` and `x`, and an integer `t` which is expected to be an input. It iterates `t` times, executing the function `func_1()` in each iteration. After the loop, it does not return any value. The function ensures that `t` is within the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \times 10^4\). If `t` is invalid, the function will still proceed but will ignore the invalid input. The function also assumes that `func_1()` processes the lists `a` and `x` in each iteration. However, the function does not validate the contents of the lists `a` and `x` against their respective constraints (i.e., \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(-n \leq x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_n \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq 0\)). Therefore, the function does not ensure these constraints are met.
