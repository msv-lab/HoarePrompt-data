The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)) and a list `V` of \(2^n - 1\) integers, each satisfying \(0 \leq v_i < 2^{n+1}\). It generates and returns all valid binary strings of length `n` based on the given conditions. Specifically, a binary string `s` of length `n` is considered valid if there exists a binary string `v` in `V` such that the count of '1's in `s` excluding one position equals the integer value of `v`. The function sorts the resulting list of valid binary strings and prints the length of this list followed by each integer value of the binary strings.
