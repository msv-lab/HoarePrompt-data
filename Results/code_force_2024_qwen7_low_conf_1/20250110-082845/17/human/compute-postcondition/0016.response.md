Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0'.
   - `valid` is `False`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **State After Previous Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the start, after the previous iteration, `i` would be 0, and we are now considering the first iteration of `j`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time.
   - After the first iteration (with `j = 0`), `i` will still be 0 because the loop body does not modify `i` directly. However, the state of `s` and `valid` might change depending on the loop body.

5. **Considering the Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how it might affect the states.
   - Typically, the loop body would check or modify `s` and possibly update `valid`.

6. **Possible Changes**:
   - `s` could change based on the loop body operations.
   - `valid` could change to `True` if a valid substring is found, or remain `False` otherwise.

7. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be 1.
   - Therefore, the loop condition `j < n` will be checked again.

Given the information and assuming the loop body does not modify `i` directly, the key states to adjust are `s` and `valid` based on the loop body's possible effects.

**Final Answer**:
- If the loop body did not modify `s` and `valid` during the first iteration, then `i` remains 0, and the conditions for the next iteration depend on the loop body's actions.
- Assuming no changes in the loop body, the states would remain as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0', and `valid` is `False`.**

If the loop body modified `s` or `valid`, the answer would reflect those changes. However, without specific details on the loop body, we assume no changes.
