The code `sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]` removes the character at index `j+2` from the string `s`. This is because `s[:j]` includes characters from the start of the string up to (but not including) index `j`, and `s[j + 1:]` includes characters starting from index `j + 1` to the end of the string. By concatenating these two slices, the character at index `j+2` (which was originally removed) is excluded.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `s[j+2]` is no longer in the string `s`
- `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+2` removed
- `valid` remains unchanged

After executing the code, the new value of `sub_s` will be the original string `s` with the character at index `j+2` removed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+2` removed; `valid` remains unchanged.**
