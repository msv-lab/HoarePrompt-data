Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-2` followed by '11', `valid` is `False`, `j` is 2, `sub_s` is a string of '0's of length `n-4` followed by '1'. If the condition `s[j] == '1'` and `not any((sub_s.count('1') == int(v, 2) for v in V))` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
