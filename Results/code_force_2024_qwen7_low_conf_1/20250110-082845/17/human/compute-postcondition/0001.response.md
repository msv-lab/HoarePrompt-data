The given code initializes an empty list `S`. This does not change the values of `n` or `V`, but it creates a new list `S` that is empty. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `S` as well as the unchanged values of `n` and `V`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 20`; `V` is a list of `2^n - 1` binary strings where each string represents the binary form of an integer `v_i` such that `0 <= v_i < 2^(n+1)`; `S` is an empty list**
