The line `valid = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `valid`. This does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0', `valid` is False, `sub_s` is a substring of `s` with the character at index `j` removed.**
