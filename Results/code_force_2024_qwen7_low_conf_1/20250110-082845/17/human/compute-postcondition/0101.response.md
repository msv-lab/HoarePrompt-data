Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)) and a list `V` of \(2^n - 1\) integers, each satisfying \(0 \leq v_i < 2^{n+1}\). It generates and returns all valid binary strings of length `n` based on the given conditions. Specifically, a binary string `s` of length `n` is considered valid if there exists a binary string `v` in `V` such that the count of '1's in `s` excluding one position equals the integer value of `v`. The function sorts the resulting list of valid binary strings and prints the length of this list followed by each integer value of the binary strings.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `n` is outside the range \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), the function will raise a `ValueError` because the list comprehension `[bin(i)[2:] for i in V]` relies on the assumption that `len(V)` is \(2^n - 1\). However, the function does not explicitly handle this case.
- If `V` contains values that do not satisfy \(0 \leq v_i < 2^{n+1}\), the function does not check for these constraints, potentially leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
- The function does not return any value explicitly; instead, it prints the results. If a return value is needed, the function could be modified to return the sorted list of valid binary strings.
