Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
- `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings.
- `S` is a list containing one binary string which is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0'.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0'.
- `valid` is `True`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is already initialized to 0.
   - `s` is already initialized as a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0'.
   - `valid` is already initialized to `True`.

3. **List `V`:**
   - The length of the list `V` is \(2^n - 1\), but this does not directly affect the execution of the loop based on the provided loop statement.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is at least 1, because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0', `valid` is `True`**
