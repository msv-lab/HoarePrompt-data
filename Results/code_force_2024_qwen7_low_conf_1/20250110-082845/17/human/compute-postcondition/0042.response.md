The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or match-case statement. In this case, since there is no loop or match-case statement provided, the only effect is that the program exits the current context (if it was inside one). The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s[j]` is no longer in the string `s`; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j` removed; `valid` is `False`.**
