The variable `valid` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `s[j]`, `sub_s`, or `V`. The initial conditions remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `valid`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s[j]` is no longer in the string `s`; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j` removed; `valid` is `False`.**
