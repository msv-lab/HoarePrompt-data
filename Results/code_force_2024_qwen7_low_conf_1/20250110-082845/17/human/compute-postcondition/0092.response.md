The code `print(len(S))` prints the length of the list `S`. The length of `S` is the number of valid binary strings of length `n` that meet the specified conditions. Since `S` is a list containing all valid binary strings of length `n`, its length is also \(2^n - 1\). The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings; `S` is a list containing all valid binary strings of length `n` that meet the specified conditions and is sorted; `i` is \(2^n - 1\); `s` is a binary string of length `n` that is the last valid string found during the loop execution; `valid` is `True`; print output is `2^n - 1`**
