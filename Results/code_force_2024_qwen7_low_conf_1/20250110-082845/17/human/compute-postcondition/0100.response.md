The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `V`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
- `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) integers where each integer \(v_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq v_i < 2^{n+1}\).

Based on the provided output cases, we can infer that the function processes the list `V` and returns a specific value or values based on some condition related to `n` and the elements in `V`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (such that 1 <= n <= 20) and a list `V` of \(2^n - 1\) integers where each integer \(v_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq v_i < 2^{n+1}\), and returns a value based on the elements in `V` and the value of `n`.**
