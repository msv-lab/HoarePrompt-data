The code `sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]` removes the character at index `j+1` from the string `s` and assigns the resulting string to `sub_s`. This operation does not affect the values of `n` or `valid`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s[j+1]` is no longer in the string `s`; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+1` removed; if `sub_s` does not contain any substring whose count of '1' matches any binary value in `V`, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, `valid` remains unchanged.**
