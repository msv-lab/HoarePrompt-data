The code removes the character at index `j` from the string `s`. Since the character at index `j` is '1', the new string `sub_s` will be the concatenation of the substring before index `j` and the substring after index `j`.

Given that the initial state includes `n` being greater than or equal to 1 and the condition `s[j]` is '1', after executing the code, `s[j]` is no longer in the string `s`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s[j]` is no longer in the string `s`; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j` removed.**
