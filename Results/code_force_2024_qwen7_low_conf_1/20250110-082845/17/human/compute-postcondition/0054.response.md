The code `break` does not change any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch-case statement. Since there is no loop or switch-case statement in the given code, the variables `n`, `sub_s`, and `valid` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+2` removed; `valid` is `False`.**
