Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \); `V` is a list of \( 2^n - 1 \) binary strings; `S` is a list containing two binary strings: a string of \( n-1 \) zeros followed by a '0' and `"1"`, and the new element `'10' * (n-1) + '10'` or `'10'`; `i` is 3; `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-2` followed by '11'; `valid` is `True`, if the length of `s` is less than `n`, `s` remains unchanged.***
