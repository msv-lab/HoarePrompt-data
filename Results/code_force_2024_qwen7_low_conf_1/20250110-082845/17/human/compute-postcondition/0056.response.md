Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+2` removed; `valid` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not '1', then `valid` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is '1' and `not any((sub_s.count('1') == int(v, 2) for v in V))` is true, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, `valid` remains unchanged.***
