The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or the most internal loop or structure we are inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement (like if-else) that would be exited by this `break`, the only effect is that the control flow exits the implied loop or structure. The values of the variables `n`, `s[j+1]`, `sub_s`, and `valid` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s[j+1]` is no longer in the string `s`; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+1` removed; `valid` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or structure.**
