Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings; `S` is a list containing two binary strings: a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0' and `"1"`; `i` is 0; `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0'; `valid` is `True` since the condition inside the if statement is true.***
