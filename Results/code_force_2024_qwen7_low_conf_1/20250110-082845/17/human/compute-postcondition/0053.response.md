The variable `valid` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `n` and `sub_s` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+2` removed; `valid` is `False`.**
