The code `V = [bin(i)[2:] for i in V]` impacts the list `V`. It converts each integer in the list `V` to its binary representation without the '0b' prefix. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `V`, we cannot specify the exact binary strings for each element. We can only state the transformation applied.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 20`
- `V` is a list of `2^n - 1` integers where each integer `v_i` satisfies `0 <= v_i < 2^(n+1)`

After executing the code, the binary representation of each integer in `V` is stored in `V`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 20`; `V` is a list of `2^n - 1` binary strings where each string represents the binary form of an integer `v_i` such that `0 <= v_i < 2^(n+1)`**
