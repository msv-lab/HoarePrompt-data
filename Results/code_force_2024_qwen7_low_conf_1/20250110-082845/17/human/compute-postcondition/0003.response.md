`s` is assigned the binary representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix. Since `i` is initially 0, the binary representation of `i` is '0'. The value of `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` remains a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings, and `S` remains an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings; `S` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `s` is '0'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings; `S` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `s` is '0'.**
