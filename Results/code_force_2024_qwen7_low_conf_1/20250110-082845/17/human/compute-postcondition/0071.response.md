The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional block that is specified to be exited here, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not relevant, `i` is 3, `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-2` followed by '0', valid is `False`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is '0'.**
