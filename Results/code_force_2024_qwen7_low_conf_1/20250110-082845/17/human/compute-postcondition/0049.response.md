Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s[j+1]` is no longer in the string `s`; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+1` removed; if `sub_s` does not contain any substring whose count of '1' matches any binary value in `V`, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, `valid` remains unchanged. Furthermore, if the if condition is false (i.e., `sub_s` contains a substring whose count of '1' matches any binary value in `V`), we do nothing, keeping the same state as before the if statement.***
