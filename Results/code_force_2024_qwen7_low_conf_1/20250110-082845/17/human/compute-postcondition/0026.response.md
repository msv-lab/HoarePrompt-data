Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0', `valid` remains False, `sub_s` is a substring of `s` with the character at index `j` removed. If none of the values in `V` match the count of '1' in `sub_s` (where each value in `V` is converted from binary), then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no change in the else part since it is not provided.***
