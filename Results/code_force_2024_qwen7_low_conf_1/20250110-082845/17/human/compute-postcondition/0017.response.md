The code snippet provided is incomplete because the variable `j` is used without being defined. However, based on the given initial state and assuming `j` is an index within the string `s`, let's consider a possible scenario where `j` is defined and lies within the bounds of the string `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 1
- `i` is 0
- `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0'
- `valid` is `False`

Let's assume `j` is a valid index in the string `s`. For simplicity, let's assume `j` is 0 (the first character of `s`).

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]` will create a substring by removing the character at index `j` from `s`.
2. If `j` is 0, `s[:j]` is an empty string (`""`) and `s[j + 1:]` is the rest of the string starting from index 1.

Therefore, `sub_s` will be a string of `n-1` zeros.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0', `sub_s` is a string of `n-1` zeros, `valid` is `False`**
