The code snippet `sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]` does not affect the variables `n`, `i`, `valid`, or `s`. It creates a new substring `sub_s` by removing the character at index `j` from `s`, but this new substring is not assigned back to any existing variable (except `sub_s`). Therefore, the variables `n`, `i`, `valid`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0', `valid` remains `False`, `sub_s` is a substring of `s` with the character at index `j` removed.**
