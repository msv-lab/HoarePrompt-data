Output State: **`i` is 3, `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-2` followed by '11', `valid` is `False`, `j` is 2, `sub_s` is a string of '0's of length `n-4` followed by '1'**

Explanation: The line `valid = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `valid`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
