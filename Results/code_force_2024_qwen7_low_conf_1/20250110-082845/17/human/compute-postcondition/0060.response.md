Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings; `S` is a list containing two binary strings: a string of \(n-1\) zeros followed by a '0' and `"1"`, and the new element `'10' * (n-1) + '10'` or `'10'`; `i` is 2; `s` is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'1'`, depending on the length of `s`; `valid` is `True`.***
