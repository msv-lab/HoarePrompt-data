The code `break` does not affect any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no such loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program would break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement it was in. However, since no loop or conditional statement is provided, we assume this is outside of any such structure.

The states of the variables `i`, `s`, `valid`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-3` followed by '11', `valid` is `False`, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
