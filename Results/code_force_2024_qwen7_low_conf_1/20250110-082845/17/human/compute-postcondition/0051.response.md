Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is greater than or equal to 1.
   - \( s[j+1] \) is no longer in the string \( s \).
   - \( sub_s \) is the string \( s \) with the character at index \( j+1 \) removed.
   - If \( sub_s \) does not contain any substring whose count of '1' matches any binary value in \( V \), then \( valid \) is `False`. Otherwise, \( valid \) remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to \( n-1 \).

3. **What Changes with Each Iteration?**
   - In each iteration, the variable \( j \) increases by 1.
   - \( s[j+1] \) will be removed from \( s \) in the next iteration, as it is no longer in \( s \) after the previous iteration.
   - \( sub_s \) will be updated to remove the character at index \( j+1 \).

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - \( n \) remains the same as it is the length of the original string \( s \) minus one character removed so far.
   - \( s[j+1] \) is no longer in the string \( s \). For the next iteration, \( s[j+2] \) will be no longer in the string \( s \).
   - \( sub_s \) will be the string \( s \) with the character at index \( j+2 \) removed.
   - \( valid \) remains unchanged unless the new \( sub_s \) does not contain any substring whose count of '1' matches any binary value in \( V \).

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is still greater than or equal to 1.
   - \( s[j+2] \) is no longer in the string \( s \).
   - \( sub_s \) is the string \( s \) with the character at index \( j+2 \) removed.
   - \( valid \) remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s[j+2]` is no longer in the string `s`; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+2` removed; `valid` remains unchanged.**
