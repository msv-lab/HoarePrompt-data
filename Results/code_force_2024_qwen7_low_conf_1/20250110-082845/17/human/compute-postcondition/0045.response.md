According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `s[j]` is no longer in the string `s`
- `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j` removed
- If `sub_s` does not contain any substring whose count of '1' matches any binary value in `V`, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, `valid` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` was used in the previous iteration, it implies that `j` is currently equal to the previous value of `j` plus 1. Therefore, `j` will be incremented by 1.

To determine the new state, we need to consider:
1. `n` remains the same because the loop condition depends on `j` being less than `n`.
2. `s[j]` is no longer in the string `s` from the previous iteration, so `s[j+1]` will be no longer in the string `s` in the next iteration.
3. `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j` removed. In the next iteration, `sub_s` will be the string `s` with the character at index `j+1` removed.
4. The value of `valid` remains unchanged unless a condition is met within the loop body that changes its value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s[j+1]` is no longer in the string `s`; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+1` removed; if `sub_s` does not contain any substring whose count of '1' matches any binary value in `V`, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, `valid` remains unchanged.**
