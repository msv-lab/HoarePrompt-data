Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0', `valid` remains `False`. If the character at index `j` of `s` is '1', then either the loop breaks due to no matching count of '1' in `sub_s` with values in `V` (converted from binary), or `valid` remains `False` if no such condition is met.***
