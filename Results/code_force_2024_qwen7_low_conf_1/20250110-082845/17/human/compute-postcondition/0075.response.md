The code `sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]` creates a substring `sub_s` by removing the character at index `j` from the string `s`. Given that `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-2` followed by '11', and `j` is 1, the string `s` would look like `'0...011'` (where there are `n-2` zeros). Removing the character at index `j` (which is the second character, '0') results in the string `'0...11'` (with `n-3` zeros).

The values of the other variables (`i`, `valid`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-3` followed by '11', `valid` is `False`, `j` is 1**
