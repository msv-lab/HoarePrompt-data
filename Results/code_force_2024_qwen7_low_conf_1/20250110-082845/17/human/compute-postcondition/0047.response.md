The code sets `valid` to `False`. This changes the value of `valid` from its previous state (which was determined by the condition involving `sub_s` and `V`), but does not affect the values of `n` or `sub_s`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s[j+1]` is no longer in the string `s`; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j+1` removed; `valid` is `False`.**
