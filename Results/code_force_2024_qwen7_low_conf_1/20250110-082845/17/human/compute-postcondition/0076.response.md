The code sets the variable `valid` to `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-3` followed by '11', `valid` is `False`, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-3` followed by '11', `valid` is `False`, `j` is 1**
