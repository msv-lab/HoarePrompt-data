The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but indicates the exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of `n-1` zeros followed by a '0', `sub_s` is a string of `n-1` zeros, `valid` is `False`**
