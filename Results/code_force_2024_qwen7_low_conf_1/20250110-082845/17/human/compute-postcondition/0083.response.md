The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables; it only causes the exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 3, `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-2` followed by '11', `valid` is `False`, `j` is 2, `sub_s` is a string of '0's of length `n-4` followed by '1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
