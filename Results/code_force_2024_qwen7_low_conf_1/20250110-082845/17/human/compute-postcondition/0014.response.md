Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is `'0' * (n-1)`, and `valid` is `False`. After executing the if-else block, if there is no substring `sub_s` in `s` such that the count of '1's in `sub_s` equals the integer value of any string `v` in `V` when `v` is interpreted as a binary number, `valid` remains `False`. Otherwise, `valid` becomes `True`.***
