Postcondition: ***`total` is not relevant, `i` is 3, `s` is a string of '0's of length `n-2` followed by '0', `valid` is `False`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is '0'.***

Explanation: Given the program fragment and the postconditions for both the if and else parts, we observe that the if condition is not satisfied because the condition inside the if statement does not result in any truth value (since there is no `else` part, the postcondition for the if part is always applied). Therefore, the overall postcondition follows the postcondition of the if part, which sets `valid` to `False`.
