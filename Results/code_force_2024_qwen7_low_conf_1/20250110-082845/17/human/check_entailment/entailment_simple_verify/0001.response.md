### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of an integer `n` followed by \(2^n - 1\) integers representing the sets \(V_i\) in binary encoding.
   - The output should list the binary encodings of all possible sets \(S\) in increasing order, and the count of such sets.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `n` and `V`.
   - It converts each element of `V` from its binary representation back to an integer.
   - It iterates over all possible subsets of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) using binary representations.
   - For each subset `s`, it checks if for every non-empty subset `sub_s` of `s`, the count of `1`s in `sub_s` equals the value of \(V_{f(sub_s)}\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, the subset `s` is added to the list `S`.
   - Finally, it sorts `S` and prints the number of elements in `S` followed by each element in `S`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly iterates over all possible subsets of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) using binary strings.
   - It correctly checks the condition for each subset and its non-empty subsets.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the way the subsets are checked. The program only considers the non-empty subsets of `s` and checks if their counts match the values in `V`. This is not sufficient because the problem requires checking for all non-empty subsets `T` of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) and verifying the condition \(|S \cap T| = V_{f(T)}\).

### Example Analysis:

Consider the first test case provided:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( V = [15] * 7 \) (which corresponds to all subsets having a sum of 0, meaning \(V_i = 0\) for all \(i\))

For \( n = 3 \), the possible subsets of \(\{0, 1, 2\}\) are:
- \(\emptyset\)
- \(\{0\}\)
- \(\{1\}\)
- \(\{2\}\)
- \(\{0, 1\}\)
- \(\{0, 2\}\)
- \(\{1, 2\}\)
- \(\{0, 1, 2\}\)

Since \(V_i = 0\) for all \(i\), the condition \(|S \cap T| = V_{f(T)}\) simplifies to \(|S \cap T| = 0\). Therefore, \(S\) must be the empty set. The program, however, incorrectly adds some non-empty subsets because it does not correctly verify the intersection condition for all subsets \(T\).

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program works correctly. The program fails to check the condition for all non-empty subsets \(T\) of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\), leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
