Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` and `V`, which represent the size of the set and the list of values, respectively. The function correctly handles the input constraints and converts the integer values in `V` from decimal to binary representation.

2. **Validation Logic**:
   - For each binary string `s` of length `n`, the program checks if there is a valid subset `T` such that the number of '1's in `s` (excluding one position) matches the integer value of the corresponding `v` in `V`.
   - This is done by iterating over each bit position `j` in `s` and checking if removing the `j`-th bit results in a count of '1's that matches any `v` in `V`.

3. **Generating Valid Sets**:
   - The program iterates through all possible binary strings of length `n` using `itertools` but is manually generated here.
   - For each binary string `s`, it checks the condition mentioned above and appends valid strings to the list `S`.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - After generating all valid binary strings, the program sorts them and prints the number of valid sets followed by each integer value of the binary strings.

Given that the implementation aligns with the problem description and the execution summary accurately reflects the expected behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
