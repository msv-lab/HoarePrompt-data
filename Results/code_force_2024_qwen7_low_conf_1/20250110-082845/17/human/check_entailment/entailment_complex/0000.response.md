### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given annotated program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Input and Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
- `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) integers, each satisfying \(0 \leq v_i < 2^{n+1}\).

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Conversion**:
   ```python
   V = [bin(i)[2:] for i in V]
   ```
   - Converts each integer in `V` to a binary string.
   
2. **Iterate Over All Possible Binary Strings of Length `n`**:
   ```python
   for i in range(2 ** n):
       s = bin(i)[2:]
   ```
   - Generates all binary strings of length `n` using integers from `0` to \(2^n - 1\).

3. **Padding Binary Strings**:
   ```python
   if len(s) < n:
       s = '0' * (n - len(s)) + s
   ```
   - Ensures all generated binary strings have exactly `n` bits by padding with leading zeros if necessary.

4. **Validation Check**:
   ```python
   valid = True
   for j in range(n):
       if s[j] == '1':
           sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]
           if not any(sub_s.count('1') == int(v, 2) for v in V):
               valid = False
               break
   ```
   - For each '1' in the binary string `s`, it checks if removing that '1' results in a count of '1's that matches any integer in `V`.

5. **Adding Valid Binary Strings to `S`**:
   ```python
   if valid:
       S.append(bin(int(s, 2) + 1)[2:])
   ```
   - If `s` passes the validation check, it converts `s` back to an integer and appends the binary representation (shifted by 1 to ensure correct ordering) to the list `S`.

6. **Sorting and Output**:
   ```python
   S.sort()
   print(len(S))
   for s in S:
       print(int(s, 2))
   ```
   - Sorts the list `S` of valid binary strings.
   - Prints the length of `S` followed by the integer values of the binary strings.

#### Correctness Verification:
- The logic correctly generates all binary strings of length `n` that satisfy the condition that for any subset `T` of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`, the count of '1's in `S \cap T` matches the integer value of `V_{f(T)}`.
- The conversion between binary strings and their integer values is handled correctly.
- The sorting and printing of the results are done as required.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find and print all valid sets `S` based on the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
