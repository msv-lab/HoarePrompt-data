You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Define the binary encoding of a finite set of natural numbers T \subseteq
\\{0,1,2,\ldots\\} as f(T) = \sum\limits_{i \in T} 2^i . For example,
f(\\{0,2\\}) = 2^0 + 2^2 = 5 and f(\\{\\}) = 0 . Notice that f is a bijection
from all such sets to all non-negative integers. As such, f^{-1} is also
defined.

You are given an integer n along with 2^n-1 sets V_1,V_2,\ldots,V_{2^n-1} .

Find all sets S that satisfy the following constraint:

  * S \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} . Note that S can be empty. 
  * For all non-empty subsets T \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} , |S \cap T| \in V_{f(T)} . 

Due to the large input and output, both input and output will be given in
terms of binary encodings of the sets.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20 ).

The second line of input contains 2^n-1 integers v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{2^n-1} (0
\leq v_i < 2^{n+1} ) â€” the sets V_i given in their binary encoding where V_i =
f^{-1}(v_i) .

Output

The first line of output should contain an integer k indicating the number of
possible S .

In the following k lines, you should output f(S) for all possible S in
increasing order.

Note

In the first test case, one possible S is f^{-1}(3) = \\{0,1\\} . All the non-
empty subsets T \subseteq \\{0,1,2\\} and the corresponding |S \cap T| , f(T)
and V_f(T) are as follows:

T | |S\cap T| | f(T) | V_{f(T)}   
---|---|---|---  
\\{0\\} | 1 | 1 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{1\\} | 1 | 2 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{2\\} | 0 | 4 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,1\\} | 2 | 3 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,2\\} | 1 | 5 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{1,2\\} | 1 | 6 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,1,2\\} | 2 | 7 | \\{2,3\\}

# Annotated Program:
import itertools

print('Test Case 1:')
func_1(3, [15] * 7)
print('\nTest Case 2:')
func_1(5, [63] * 16)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and V is a list of 2^n - 1 integers where each integer v_i satisfies 0 <= v_i < 2^(n+1).
def func_1(n, V):
    V = [bin(i)[2:] for i in V]
    S = []
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        s = bin(i)[2:]
        
        if len(s) < n:
            s = '0' * (n - len(s)) + s
        
        valid = True
        
        for j in range(n):
            if s[j] == '1':
                sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]
                if not any(sub_s.count('1') == int(v, 2) for v in V):
                    valid = False
                    break
        
        if valid:
            S.append(bin(int(s, 2) + 1)[2:])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings; `S` is a list containing all valid binary strings of length \(n\) that meet the specified conditions; `i` is \(2^n - 1\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n\) that is the last valid string found during the loop execution; `valid` is `True` since no further valid strings can be added to the list `S`.
    S.sort()
    print(len(S))
    for s in S:
        print(int(s, 2))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings, `S` is a non-empty list containing all valid binary strings of length `n` that meet specific conditions and is sorted, `i` is \(2^n - 1\), `s` is the last valid binary string in the sorted list `S`, `valid` is `True`, and the output of the print statement is \(2^n - 1\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)) and a list `V` of \(2^n - 1\) integers, each satisfying \(0 \leq v_i < 2^{n+1}\). It generates and returns all valid binary strings of length `n` based on the given conditions. Specifically, a binary string `s` of length `n` is considered valid if there exists a binary string `v` in `V` such that the count of '1's in `s` excluding one position equals the integer value of `v`. The function sorts the resulting list of valid binary strings and prints the length of this list followed by each integer value of the binary strings.
