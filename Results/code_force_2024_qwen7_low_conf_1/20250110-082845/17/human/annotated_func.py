    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings; `S` is a list containing all valid binary strings of length \(n\) that meet the specified conditions; `i` is \(2^n - 1\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n\) that is the last valid string found during the loop execution; `valid` is `True` since no further valid strings can be added to the list `S`.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) binary strings, `S` is a non-empty list containing all valid binary strings of length `n` that meet specific conditions and is sorted, `i` is \(2^n - 1\), `s` is the last valid binary string in the sorted list `S`, `valid` is `True`, and the output of the print statement is \(2^n - 1\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)) and a list `V` of \(2^n - 1\) integers, each satisfying \(0 \leq v_i < 2^{n+1}\). It generates and returns all valid binary strings of length `n` based on the given conditions. Specifically, a binary string `s` of length `n` is considered valid if there exists a binary string `v` in `V` such that the count of '1's in `s` excluding one position equals the integer value of `v`. The function sorts the resulting list of valid binary strings and prints the length of this list followed by each integer value of the binary strings.
