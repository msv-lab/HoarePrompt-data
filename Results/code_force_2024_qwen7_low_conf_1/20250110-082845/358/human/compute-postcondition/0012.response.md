The code `len_arr[i] = len(a[i])` updates the value of `len_arr[i]` to the length of the string `a[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `a` is a list of strings from the input.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` equal to the length of the first string in `a`.
- `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros where `zrr[0] = len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`.
- `ans` is `len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`.
- `i` is 1.

After the first iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented to 1, and the value of `len_arr[1]` is set to the length of the second string in the list `a`. Since the exact strings in `a` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `len_arr[1]`, but it is the length of the second string in `a`.

Therefore, the output state after this code execution is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` equal to the length of the first string in `a` and `len_arr[1]` equal to the length of the second string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros where `zrr[0] = len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is `len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `i` is 2**
