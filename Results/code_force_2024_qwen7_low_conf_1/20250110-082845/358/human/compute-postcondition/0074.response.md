`n` and `m` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`. This means two integers are taken as input and assigned to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an input integer, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr` plus the sum of all elements in `zrr` for which the index is odd and less than `n`, and `t` is `t-1`.**
