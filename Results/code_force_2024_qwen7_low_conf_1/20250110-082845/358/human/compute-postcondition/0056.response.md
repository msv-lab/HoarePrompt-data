`zrr.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `zrr` in descending order. The original values of `zrr` are a list of `n` integers where each element is the number of trailing zeros removed from the corresponding string in `a`. Sorting this list does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the number of elements in `a`, `m` is an integer from input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the length of the corresponding string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the number of trailing zeros removed from the corresponding string in `a` sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr`.**
