The code initializes a new list `zrr` with `n` zeros. The length of this list `zrr` is `n`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `len_arr` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `zrr` and retains the original values of `a`, `m`, and `len_arr`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros**
