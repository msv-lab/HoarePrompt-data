`zrr[i]` is assigned the value of `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`. This operation calculates the number of trailing zeros in the string `a[i]` and subtracts it from the length of `a[i]`.

Since the initial state of `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, and now only the element at index `i` is updated, the output state will be:

- `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, except for the element at index `i`, which is updated to `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is ['string1', 'string2', ..., 'stringn'], `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is less than `n`, `len_arr` is a list where one element (at index `i`) is updated to the length of `a[i]` and the rest are zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, except for the element at index `i`, which is updated to `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is 0, and `t` is `t-1`.**
