The code snippet updates `len_arr[i]` to the length of the string `a[i]`. Given the initial state and the fact that `i` is 4, this means `len_arr[4]` will be updated to the length of `a[4]`.

- The initial state includes `a` being a list of strings from the input, `n` as the first integer input, `m` as the second integer input, `len_arr` as a list of `n` zeros where the first two elements are set based on the lengths of the first two strings in `a`, and `zrr` as a list of `n` zeros with some specific values. 
- `ans` is initially set to `len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`.
- `i` is 4.

After executing the line `len_arr[i] = len(a[i])`, `len_arr[4]` will be updated to the length of `a[4]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros where `len_arr[0]` is the length of the first string in `a`, `len_arr[1]` is the length of the second string in `a`, `len_arr[4]` is the length of `a[4]`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros where `zrr[0] = len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `zrr[1] = 0`, `zrr[2] = len(a[2]) - len(a[2].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is `len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `i` is 4**
