The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `a` is a list of strings from the input; `n` is an integer from input; `m` is an integer from input; `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros; `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is 0; `t` is `t - 1`; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list of strings from the input**
