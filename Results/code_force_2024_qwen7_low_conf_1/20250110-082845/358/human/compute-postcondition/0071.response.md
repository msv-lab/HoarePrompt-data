The code `print('Anna')` prints the string 'Anna' to the console. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The only change is the print statement itself.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr` plus the sum of all elements in `zrr` for which the index is odd and less than `n`. `ans` is less than `m`, a line of output 'Anna' is printed to the console.**
