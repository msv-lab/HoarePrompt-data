`len_arr[i]` is assigned the value of `len(a[i])`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `len_arr[0]` is assigned the length of the first string in the list `a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` equal to the length of the first string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
