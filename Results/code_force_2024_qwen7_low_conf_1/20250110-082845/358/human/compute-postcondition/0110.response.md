The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it operates on predefined inputs that are part of the problem's setup, including a positive integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), and within each of the `t` test cases, integers `n` and `m` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)), and a list of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) (where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\)). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The function's output depends on the specific implementation details, which are not provided here. However, based on the given constraints and relationships, the function likely processes these inputs to produce some form of result.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), and within each of the \(t\) test cases, integers \(n\) and \(m\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)), and a list of \(n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) (where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\)). The sum of \(n\) across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specified conditions.**
