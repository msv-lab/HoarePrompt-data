`zrr[i]` is assigned the value of `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`. Since `i` is 0, this means `zrr[0]` is assigned the value of `len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer from input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` being the length of `a[0]`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros with `zrr[0]` being `len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 1.**
