Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is `n` (since the loop has finished executing), `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the length of the corresponding string in `a` without trailing zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the count of trailing zeros in the corresponding string in `a`, sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` with contributions from `zrr[i]` where `i` satisfies `i % 2 != 0`, and `t` is `t - (n - 1)`. The current value of `ans` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`**
