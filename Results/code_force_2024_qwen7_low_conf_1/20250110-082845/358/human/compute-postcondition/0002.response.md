The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state is that `t` is a valid integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). After running this code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, while `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the two integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is a valid integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input**
