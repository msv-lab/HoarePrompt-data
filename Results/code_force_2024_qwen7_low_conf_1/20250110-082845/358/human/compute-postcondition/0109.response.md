Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `len_arr` is a list of 0 integers, `zrr` is a list of 0 integers, `ans` is 0, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, and each iteration processes `n` and `m` along with a list of strings `a`.
- After processing all `t` inputs, `t` becomes 0 because it decreases by 1 each time an input is processed.
- If no inputs are provided (`t` is 0 from the start), then `a` remains an empty list, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `len_arr` is a list of 0 integers, `zrr` is a list of 0 integers, and `ans` is 0.
- The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n` (which is 0) after all iterations are complete since the loop exits when `t` becomes 0.

This covers the state after all iterations of the loop have finished, whether the loop executes or not.
