The code updates `ans` by adding the difference between `len_arr[i]` and `zrr[i]` where `i` is 5. Let's break down the values:

- `len_arr[5]` is the length of `a[5]`.
- `zrr[5]` is `len(a[5]) - len(a[5]).rstrip('0')`.

Therefore, `ans += len_arr[5] - zrr[5]` translates to `ans += len(a[5]) - (len(a[5]) - len(a[5]).rstrip('0'))`. Simplifying this, we get `ans += len(a[5]).rstrip('0')`.

Given the initial state, `ans` was `-zrr[4]`, which means `ans` was initially `-zrr[4] = -(len(a[4]) - len(a[4]).rstrip('0'))`.

After the operation, `ans` becomes `-zrr[4] + len(a[5]).rstrip('0')`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings from input, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer from input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` being the length of `a[0]` and `len_arr[5]` updated to the length of `a[5]`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros with `zrr[0]` being `len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `zrr[3]` being the length of `a[3]` - `len(a[3]).rstrip('0')`, and `zrr[4]` being the length of `a[4]` - `len(a[4]).rstrip('0')`, `ans` is `-zrr[4] + len(a[5]).rstrip('0')`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 5, `zrr[5]` remains the same.**
