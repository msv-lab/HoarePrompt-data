Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr` plus the second largest element in `zrr`. If `i % 2 != 0`, then `ans` is additionally increased by the fourth largest element in `zrr`.***
