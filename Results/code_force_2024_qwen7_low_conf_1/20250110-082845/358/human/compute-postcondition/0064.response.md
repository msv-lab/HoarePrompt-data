Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `a` is a list of strings
   - `n` must be greater than 3
   - `i` is 3
   - `m` is an integer
   - `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers
   - `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order
   - `ans` is the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr` plus the second largest element in `zrr`
     - If `i % 2 != 0`, then `ans` is additionally increased by the fourth largest element in `zrr`

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 3
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.

4. **Impact on Other Variables:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no changes are directly made to `a`, `n`, `m`, `len_arr`, or `zrr`.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given information, we don't have specifics about the loop body.

5. **New States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` becomes 4
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 3)
   - `len_arr` remains the same
   - `zrr` remains the same
   - `ans` remains the same unless the loop body modifies it

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr` plus the second largest element in `zrr`. If `i % 2 != 0`, then `ans` is additionally increased by the fourth largest element in `zrr`.**
