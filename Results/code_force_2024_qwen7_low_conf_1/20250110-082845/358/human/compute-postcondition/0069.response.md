The code `print('Sasha')` simply prints the string 'Sasha' to the console and does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr` plus the sum of all elements in `zrr` for which the index is odd and less than `n`, and the string 'Sasha' is printed to the console.**
