Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 (since i % 2 != 0), `m` is an integer, `len_arr` is a list of n integers, `zrr` is a list of n integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr`. The current value of `i` is odd.**
