`len_arr` is assigned a list of `n` zeros using the expression `[0] * n`. This initializes `len_arr` as a list with `n` elements, each element being 0. The values of `a` and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, and `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros**
