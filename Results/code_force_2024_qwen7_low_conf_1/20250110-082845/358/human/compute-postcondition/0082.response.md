The code `ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `len_arr[i]` and `zrr[i]` to the current value of `ans`. Let's analyze the values of `len_arr[i]` and `zrr[i]`.

From the initial state:
- `len_arr` is a list where one element (at index `i`) is updated to the length of `a[i]` and the rest are zeros.
- `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, except for the element at index `i`, which is updated to `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`.

Therefore:
- `len_arr[i]` is `len(a[i])`.
- `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`.

So, the expression `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` simplifies to:
\[ len(a[i]) - (len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))) = len(a[i].rstrip('0')) \]

Given this, the new value of `ans` will be:
\[ ans += len(a[i].rstrip('0')) \]

Since `ans` was initially `0`, the new value of `ans` will be `len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is ['string1', 'string2', ..., 'stringn'], `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is less than `n`, `len_arr` is a list where one element (at index `i`) is updated to the length of `a[i]` and the rest are zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, except for the element at index `i`, which is updated to `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is `len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`, and `t` is `t-1`.**
