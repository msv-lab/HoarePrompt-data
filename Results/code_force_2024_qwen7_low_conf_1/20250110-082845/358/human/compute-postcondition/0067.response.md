Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr` plus the sum of all elements in `zrr` for which the index is odd and less than `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `a` using `range(n)`. The condition `if i % 2 != 0:` ensures that only the elements with odd indices (1-based) are considered.
- **Effect on `ans`**: For each iteration where `i % 2 != 0` (i.e., when `i` is odd), the value at index `i` in `zrr` is added to `ans`. This means that `ans` accumulates the values of `zrr` at odd indices.
- **Final Value of `ans`**: After all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr`, plus the sum of all elements in `zrr` for which the index is odd and less than `n`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is as described above.
