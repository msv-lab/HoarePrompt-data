The code initializes `len_arr` as a list of `n` zeros. Given that `n` is an integer from input, the value of `len_arr` will be a list of `n` zeros. Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is the same as before, `ans` is the same as before, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of strings from the input**
