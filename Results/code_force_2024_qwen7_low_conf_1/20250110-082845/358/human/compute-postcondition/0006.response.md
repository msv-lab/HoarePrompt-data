The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0**
