The code `ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` updates the value of `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, this translates to `ans += len_arr[3] - zrr[3]`.

From the initial state:
- `len_arr[0]` is the length of the first string in `a`.
- `len_arr[1]` is the length of the second string in `a`.
- `len_arr[3]` is initially 0 (since `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros).
- `zrr[0] = len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`.
- `zrr[1] = 0`.
- `zrr[2] = len(a[2]) - len(a[2].rstrip('0'))`.
- `zrr[3]` is initially 0 (since `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros).
- `ans` is `len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`.

Since `len_arr[3]` and `zrr[3]` are both 0, the expression `len_arr[3] - zrr[3]` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` equal to the length of the first string in `a` and `len_arr[1]` equal to the length of the second string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros where `zrr[0] = len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `zrr[1] = 0`, `zrr[2] = len(a[2]) - len(a[2].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is `len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `i` is 3, `ans` is unchanged.**
