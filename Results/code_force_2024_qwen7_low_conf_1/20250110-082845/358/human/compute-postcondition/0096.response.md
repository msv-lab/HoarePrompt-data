Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is 1 or 3 (depending on the condition `i % 2 != 0`), `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the length of the corresponding string in `a` without trailing zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the count of trailing zeros in the corresponding string in `a`, sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` with an additional `zrr[1]` if `i` is 3, and `t` is `t - 1`.**
