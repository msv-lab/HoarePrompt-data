Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is 1 (since `i % 2 != 0` implies `i` was previously 0 and now it has incremented), `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the length of the corresponding string in `a` without trailing zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the count of trailing zeros in the corresponding string in `a`, sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and `t` is `t - 1`.**
