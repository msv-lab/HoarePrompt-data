The code assigns the value of `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` to `zrr[i]`. Here, `i` is 0 since it's the first iteration. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of strings from the input
- `n` is the first integer input (greater than 0)
- `m` is the second integer input
- `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` equal to the length of the first string in `a`
- `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is 0

The code will execute as follows:
- `zrr[0]` is assigned the value of `len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`.

The output state is:
**`a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` equal to the length of the first string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros where `zrr[0] = len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
