The code `len_arr[i] = len(a[i])` updates the value of `len_arr[i]` to the length of the string `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 5, this means `len_arr[5]` will be set to the length of `a[5]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Here's the breakdown:
- `total` remains 0.
- `a` remains a list of strings from input.
- `n` must still be greater than 2.
- `m` remains an integer from input.
- `len_arr` now has `len_arr[5]` updated to the length of `a[5]`.
- `zrr` remains unchanged.
- `ans` remains `-zrr[4]`.
- `t` remains `t - 1`.
- `i` remains 5.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `a` is a list of strings from input; `n` must be greater than 2; `m` is an integer from input; `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` being the length of `a[0]` and `len_arr[5]` updated to the length of `a[5]`; `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros with `zrr[0]` being `len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `zrr[3]` being the length of `a[3]` - `len(a[3]).rstrip('0')`, and `zrr[4]` being the length of `a[4]` - `len(a[4]).rstrip('0')`; `ans` is -zrr[4]; `t` is `t - 1`; `i` is 5.**
