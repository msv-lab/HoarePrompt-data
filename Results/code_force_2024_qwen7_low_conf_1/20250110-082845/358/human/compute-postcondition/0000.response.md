`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial values of `t` are within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but after the code executes, `t` is now an integer input from the user, which could be any value within this range.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
