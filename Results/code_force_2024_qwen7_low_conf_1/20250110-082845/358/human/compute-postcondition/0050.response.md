Let's break down the given code step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `total` is 0
   - `a` is a list of strings from the input
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `m` is an integer from input
   - `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` being the length of `a[0]` and `len_arr[3]` updated to the length of `a[3]`
   - `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros with `zrr[0]` being `len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `zrr[3]` being the length of `a[3]` - `len(a[3]).rstrip('0')`, and `zrr[4]` being the length of `a[4]` - `len(a[4]).rstrip('0')`
   - `ans` is 0
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `i` is 4

2. The code snippet updates `ans` by adding the difference between `len_arr[i]` and `zrr[i]` to `ans`. Given `i` is 4, this means:
   - `ans` is updated by adding `len_arr[4] - zrr[4]`

3. Since `len_arr[4]` is 0 (as `len_arr` is initialized with zeros), and `zrr[4]` is the length of `a[4]` - `len(a[4]).rstrip('0')`, the expression `len_arr[4] - zrr[4]` simplifies to `-zrr[4]`.

4. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `0 - zrr[4]` which simplifies to `-zrr[4]`.

Given the initial state, the new state of the variables after executing the code is:
- `total` remains 0
- `a` remains unchanged
- `n` remains unchanged
- `m` remains unchanged
- `len_arr` remains unchanged
- `zrr` remains unchanged
- `ans` is now `-zrr[4]`
- `t` remains unchanged
- `i` remains 4

Output State: **`total` is 0; `a` is a list of strings from the input; `n` must be greater than 2; `m` is an integer from input; `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` being the length of `a[0]` and `len_arr[3]` updated to the length of `a[3]`; `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros with `zrr[0]` being `len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `zrr[3]` being the length of `a[3]` - `len(a[3]).rstrip('0')`, and `zrr[4]` being the length of `a[4]` - `len(a[4]).rstrip('0')`; `ans` is -zrr[4]; `t` is `t - 1`; `i` is 4**
