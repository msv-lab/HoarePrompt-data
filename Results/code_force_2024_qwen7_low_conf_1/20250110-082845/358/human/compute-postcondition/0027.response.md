Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `len_arr[i]` is the length of the string `a[i]`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each `zrr[i]` is initially equal to `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` but now sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in range `n` starting from `i = 1`, `i` is 2. If `i % 2 != 0`, then `ans` is additionally incremented by `zrr[1]`.***
