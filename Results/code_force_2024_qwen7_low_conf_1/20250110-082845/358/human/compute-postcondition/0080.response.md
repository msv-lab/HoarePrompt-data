The code assigns the length of the string at index `i` in the list `a` to the variable `len_arr[i]`. Given the initial state, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, and `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `len_arr[i]` will be updated to the length of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is ['string1', 'string2', ..., 'stringn'], `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is less than `n`, `len_arr` is a list where one element (at index `i`) is updated to the length of `a[i]` and the rest are zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, and `t` is `t-1`.**
