The code snippet updates the `len_arr[i]` to the length of `a[i]`. Here, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `a` is a list of strings.

From the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `a` is a list of strings, e.g., `['string1', 'string2', ..., 'stringn']`
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`
- `len_arr` is a list where one element (at index `i_prev + 1`) is updated to the length of `a[i_prev + 1]` and the rest are zeros
- `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, except for the element at index `i_prev + 1`, which is updated to `len(a[i_prev + 1]) - len(a[i_prev + 1].rstrip('0'))`
- `ans` is `len(a[i_prev + 1].rstrip('0'))`
- `t` is `t - 1`

After executing `len_arr[i] = len(a[i])`:
- `i` remains `i_prev + 1`
- `len_arr[i]` is now updated to the length of `a[i]`, i.e., `len_arr[i_prev + 1]` is updated to `len(a[i_prev + 1])`
- The rest of the `len_arr` remains zero

So, the updated states are:
- `total` is 0
- `a` is unchanged
- `n` is unchanged
- `m` is unchanged
- `i` is unchanged
- `len_arr` is updated such that `len_arr[i_prev + 1]` is `len(a[i_prev + 1])`, and the rest are zeros
- `zrr` is unchanged
- `ans` is unchanged
- `t` is `t - 1`

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `len_arr` is a list where one element (at index `i_prev + 1`) is `len(a[i_prev + 1])` and the rest are zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, except for the element at index `i_prev + 1`, which is updated to `len(a[i_prev + 1]) - len(a[i_prev + 1].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is `len(a[i_prev + 1].rstrip('0'))`, and `t` is `t - 1**
