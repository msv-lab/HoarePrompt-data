The code `ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `len_arr[i]` and `zrr[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `ans` is updated by `len_arr[0] - zrr[0]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `zrr[0] = len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`

So, the new value of `ans` is:
- `ans = 0 + (len_arr[0] - zrr[0])`

Since `len_arr[0]` is the length of the first string in `a`, and `zrr[0]` is already defined as `len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, the value of `ans` becomes:
- `ans = len(a[0]) - (len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0')))`
- `ans = len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`

Therefore, the output state is:
**`a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros with `len_arr[0]` equal to the length of the first string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros where `zrr[0] = len(a[0]) - len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is `len(a[0].rstrip('0'))`, `i` is 1**
