Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `n`.

3. **Range Function**: The `range(n)` function generates numbers from `0` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute even once, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, and the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, the loop will not execute because `i` is not less than `n`.
   - To make the loop execute at least once, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `n`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to be less than `n`.

The other variables (`total`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `len_arr`, `zrr`, `ans`, and `t`) do not affect the execution of the loop based on the provided information.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`total` is 0, `a` is ['string1', 'string2', ..., 'stringn'], `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is less than `n`, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, and `t` is `t-1`.**
