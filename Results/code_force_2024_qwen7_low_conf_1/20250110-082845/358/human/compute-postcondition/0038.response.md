The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This means that `a` remains a list of strings from the input, `total` remains 0, `len_arr`, `zrr`, `ans`, `t`, and `i` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `len_arr` is the same as before, `zrr` is the same as before, `ans` is the same as before, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is `n + 1`**
