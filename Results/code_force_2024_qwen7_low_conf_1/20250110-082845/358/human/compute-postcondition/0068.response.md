Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of strings, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `len_arr` minus the sum of all elements in `zrr` plus the sum of all elements in `zrr` for which the index is odd and less than `n`. The current value of `ans` is greater than or equal to `m` + 1**
