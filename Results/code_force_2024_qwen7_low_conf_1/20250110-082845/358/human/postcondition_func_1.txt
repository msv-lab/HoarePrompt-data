The function `func_2` accepts a list of strings `arr`, where each string is a valid representation of an integer in the range [1, 10^9]. It iterates through the list to find the index of a string whose last character is '0' and for which `func_1(arr[i])` is greater than `func_1(arr[idx])`. If such an index is found, it reverses the integer represented by this string, converts it back to a string, and updates the list at this index. Finally, it returns the list `arr`, the index `idx` of the modified string, a boolean `found` indicating whether such an index was found, and the modified string `arr[idx]` as the string representation of the reversed integer.
