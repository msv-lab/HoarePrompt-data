Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The input for the integers is read as strings, but the comparison is done based on their length after removing trailing zeros. This approach does not correctly reflect the actual values after reversing the digits.

2. **Game Logic Implementation**: The program calculates the sum of lengths of numbers after removing trailing zeros, but it does not correctly simulate the game's moves. Specifically, it does not handle the concatenation of two numbers and does not properly reduce the list size as per the game rules.

3. **Win Condition Check**: The condition `if ans - 1 >= m:` checks if the total length of the numbers (after removing trailing zeros) minus one is greater than or equal to `m`. This is not equivalent to checking if Sasha can form a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\) after his move.

To illustrate with an example, consider the following test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  3 5
  9 56 1
  ```

- **Expected Output**: Anna should win because after Anna reverses 1 to 1, Sasha cannot form a number greater than or equal to \(10^5 = 100000\).

However, the program would incorrectly print "Sasha" because it only sums the lengths of the numbers after removing trailing zeros without correctly simulating the game's moves.

Since the program does not correctly simulate the game's logic and does not accurately determine the winner based on the problem description, the correctness is **False**.
