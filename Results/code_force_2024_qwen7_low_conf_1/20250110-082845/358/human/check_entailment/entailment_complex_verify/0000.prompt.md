You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Output

    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `len_arr` is a list of 0 integers, `zrr` is a list of 0 integers, `ans` is 0, and `i` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \(n\), an integer \(m\), and a list of \(n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\). For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the lengths of the strings in the list \(a\), specifically considering the number of trailing zeros. It then checks if `ans - 1` is greater than or equal to \(m\). If true, it prints 'Sasha', otherwise it prints 'Anna'. The function handles up to \(10^4\) test cases, with each \(n\) not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of all \(n\) values not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^5\). The function does not modify the input list `a` but instead works with derived lists `len_arr` and `zrr`. The function does not handle edge cases where the input might be invalid (e.g., non-integer values for \(t\), \(n\), or \(m\), or non-positive integers for \(m\)).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The input for the integers is read as strings, but the comparison is done based on their length after removing trailing zeros. This approach does not correctly reflect the actual values after reversing the digits.

2. **Game Logic Implementation**: The program calculates the sum of lengths of numbers after removing trailing zeros, but it does not correctly simulate the game's moves. Specifically, it does not handle the concatenation of two numbers and does not properly reduce the list size as per the game rules.

3. **Win Condition Check**: The condition `if ans - 1 >= m:` checks if the total length of the numbers (after removing trailing zeros) minus one is greater than or equal to `m`. This is not equivalent to checking if Sasha can form a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\) after his move.

To illustrate with an example, consider the following test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  3 5
  9 56 1
  ```

- **Expected Output**: Anna should win because after Anna reverses 1 to 1, Sasha cannot form a number greater than or equal to \(10^5 = 100000\).

However, the program would incorrectly print "Sasha" because it only sums the lengths of the numbers after removing trailing zeros without correctly simulating the game's moves.

Since the program does not correctly simulate the game's logic and does not accurately determine the winner based on the problem description, the correctness is **False**.
