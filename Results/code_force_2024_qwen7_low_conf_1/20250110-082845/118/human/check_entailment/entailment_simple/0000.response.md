Correctness: **True**

### Explanation

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case separately.
   - Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even). The input is handled through `input()` and `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program constructs a permutation of length `n` using a strategy that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - It uses two pointers `l` (starting at 1) and `r` (starting at `n`) to populate the `ans` array.
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the `ans` array in steps of `k`. For each segment, it assigns the leftmost (`l`) or rightmost (`r`) value depending on whether the current index `i` is even or odd.

3. **Ensuring K-Level Property**:
   - By assigning values in alternating directions (`l` and `r`), the program ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any segment of length `k` does not exceed 1. This is because the values are spread out as evenly as possible across the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation is printed for each test case.

Given these points, the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
