You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    (l, r) = (1, n)
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(i, n, k):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                ans[j] = l
                l += 1
            else:
                ans[j] = r
                r -= 1
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
Functionality: The function processes a permutation of integers from 1 to n and fills an array `ans` with alternating values based on the indices determined by `k`. Specifically, it alternates between incrementing and decrementing values starting from 1 and n respectively. After executing the nested loops, the array `ans` is printed. If `k` is even, `l` starts at 1 and `r` starts at `n`, and if `k` is odd, `l` starts at 1 and `r` starts at `n-1`. The function ensures that the values in `ans` are filled such that for every `j` in the range `[0, n-k+1, k]`, `ans[j]` is either `l` or `r` depending on whether the index `i` is even or odd. There are no explicit checks for edge cases within the provided code, but the loop and conditional statements handle the alternating logic correctly for the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided Python program attempts to generate a k-level permutation for given \( n \) and \( k \). Here's how it works:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
3. It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to 1 and \( n \) respectively, and an array `ans` of size \( n \) filled with zeros.
4. It uses a nested loop to fill the `ans` array:
   - The outer loop runs for \( k \) times, setting up blocks of length \( k \).
   - The inner loop iterates over indices in steps of \( k \), ensuring every segment of length \( k \) is covered.
   - If the index `i` (from the outer loop) is even, it assigns `l` to the current position in `ans` and increments `l`.
   - If the index `i` is odd, it assigns `r` to the current position in `ans` and decrements `r`.

This approach ensures that the values in `ans` are incrementally increasing and then decreasing, which helps in maintaining the k-level property. Specifically, the sums of consecutive segments of length \( k \) will have a difference of at most 1 due to the way values are alternately assigned.

Given the constraints and the problem statement, this method guarantees that the output is a valid k-level permutation.
