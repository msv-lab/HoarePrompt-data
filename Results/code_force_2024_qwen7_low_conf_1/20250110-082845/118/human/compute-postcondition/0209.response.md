The code sets `f` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is equal to `b - l`, `m` is either 1 or 0, `o` is a list containing `[b, s]`, `f` is 0, `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` minus 1 or -1, and `y` is incremented by 1.
