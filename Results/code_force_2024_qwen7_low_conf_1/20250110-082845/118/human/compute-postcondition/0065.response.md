The code snippet `ans[j] = r` assigns the value of `r` to `ans[j]`. However, the values of `i`, `l`, and `2k` (which affects the value of `l` and `r`) are not directly changed by this line of code. Therefore, we only update the value of `ans[j]` and keep the values of `i`, `l`, and `r` as they were determined by the conditions given in the initial state.

From the initial state:
- `i` is `3k`
- `l` is `previous_l + 1` if `2k` was even, otherwise `l` is `previous_l`
- `r` is `r - 1` if `2k` was odd, otherwise `r` remains the same

Since the code does not directly modify `i`, `l`, or `r`, their values remain unchanged. The only modification is to the array `ans` at index `j`.

Output State: **`i` is `3k`, `l` is `previous_l + 1` if `2k` was even, `r` is `r - 1` if `2k` was odd; `ans[j]` is equal to `r`**
