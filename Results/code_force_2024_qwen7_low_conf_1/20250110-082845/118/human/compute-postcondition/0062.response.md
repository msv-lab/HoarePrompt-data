To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is `2k`.
   - `l` is updated based on the previous logic for even or odd `k`.
   - `r` is updated based on the previous logic for even or odd `k`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i, n, k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Logic:**
   - If `i` (which is `2k`) is even, then:
     - `l` is set to `previous_l + 1`.
     - `ans[j]` for all `j` in the range `[i, n-1, k]` is set to `previous_l + 1`.
   - If `i` (which is `2k`) is odd, then:
     - `r` is set to `r - 1`.
     - `ans[j]` for all `j` in the range `[i, n-1, k]` is set to `r - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration Conditions:**
   - The loop will execute if `j < n`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `k`, making it `2k + k = 3k`.

Let's consider the two cases:

### Case 1: `i` (which is `2k`) is Even
- `l` becomes `previous_l + 1`.
- `ans[j]` for all `j` in the range `[2k, n-1, k]` is set to `previous_l + 1`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be `3k`.
- Since `3k` is not guaranteed to be even, we need to check the new value of `l` and `r`.

### Case 2: `i` (which is `2k`) is Odd
- `r` becomes `r - 1`.
- `ans[j]` for all `j` in the range `[2k, n-1, k]` is set to `r - 1`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be `3k`.
- Since `3k` is not guaranteed to be odd, we need to check the new value of `l` and `r`.

Since the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `n` and `j` advancing by `k` until `j` reaches `n-1`, we need to ensure that the next `i` (`3k`) is within the valid range.

### Adjusted States for Next Iteration:
- `i` becomes `3k`.
- `l` becomes `previous_l + 1` if `2k` was even.
- `r` becomes `r - 1` if `2k` was odd.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:
- `i` is `3k`.
- `l` is `previous_l + 1` if `2k` was even.
- `r` is `r - 1` if `2k` was odd.

State: **`i` is `3k`, `l` is `previous_l + 1` if `2k` was even, `r` is `r - 1` if `2k` was odd**
