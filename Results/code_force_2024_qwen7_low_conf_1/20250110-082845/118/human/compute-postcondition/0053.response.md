Output State: **`i` is `k` and is odd, `l` is the original value of `l` plus the number of even iterations up to `k-1`, `r` is the original value of `r` minus the number of odd iterations up to `k-1`, `ans[j]` is `r` for all `j` in the range `[i, n-1, k]`, and `i` (which is `k`) must be less than `n` and within the range `[0, n-1]`**
