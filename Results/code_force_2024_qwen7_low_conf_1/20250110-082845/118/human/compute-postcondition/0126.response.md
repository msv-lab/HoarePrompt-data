Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is `a - 1`
   - `b` is a non-negative integer (same as its previous value)
   - `c` is the same as its previous value
   - `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`
   - `s` is `b - l`
   - `m` is 1 if `b + 1` is divisible by `c` and 0 otherwise
   - `o` is a list containing `[b]`
   - `f` is 1 if the if condition is not met (i.e., `l` is odd) and 0 if the if condition is met (i.e., `l` is even)
   - `y` is `b + 1`
   - `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   o.append(s)
   ```

   - The code appends the value of `s` to the list `o`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `o` now contains `[b, s]` because it was previously `[b]` and now `s` is appended.

4. **Output State:**
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `c` remains unchanged.
   - `h` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `o` now contains `[b, s]`.
   - `f` remains unchanged.
   - `y` remains unchanged.
   - `l` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is a non-negative integer (same as its previous value), `c` is the same as its previous value, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is `b - l`, `m` is 1 if `b + 1` is divisible by `c` and 0 otherwise, `o` is a list containing `[b, s]`, `f` is 1 if the if condition is not met (i.e., `l` is odd) and 0 if the if condition is met (i.e., `l` is even), `y` is `b + 1`, and `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`.**
