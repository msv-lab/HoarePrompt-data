`l` is incremented by 1, which means `l` becomes `l + 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The initial state that `i` is an integer less than `n` and `k` and `ans[j]` is now equal to `l` is preserved.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`; `ans[j]` is now equal to `l + 1`**
