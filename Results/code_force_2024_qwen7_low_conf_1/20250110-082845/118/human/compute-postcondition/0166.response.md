The line `o = []` initializes an empty list named `o`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `h`, `s`, or `m`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `o`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is `a - 2`; `b` is the first integer entered by the user; `c` is the second integer entered by the user; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `s` is equal to `b`; `m` is 0; `o` is an empty list**
