`l` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `l` was `l` which is equal to the original value of `l` plus \((k-2)/2 + 1\). Therefore, the new value of `l` is the original value of `l` plus \((k-2)/2 + 2\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `k` and is even, `l` is the original value of `l` plus \((k-2)/2 + 2\), `r` is the original value of `r` minus \((k-1)/2\), `ans[j]` is `l` for all `j` in the range `[k, n-1, k]`, and `i` (which is `k`) must be less than `n` and within the range `[0, n-1]`**
