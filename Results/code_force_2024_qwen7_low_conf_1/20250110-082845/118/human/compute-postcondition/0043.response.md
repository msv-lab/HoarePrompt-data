`ans[j]` is assigned the value `r`. Given that `j` is `i + k`, the value of `j` is `i + k`. The value of `i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`, and the value of `j` is `i + k`. Since `ans[j]` is assigned a new value, the previous value of `ans[j]` is no longer relevant. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`; `j` is `i + k`; `ans[j]` is assigned `r`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`; `j` is `i + k`; `ans[j]` is assigned `r`**
