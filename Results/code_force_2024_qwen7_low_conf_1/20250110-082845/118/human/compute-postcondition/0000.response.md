The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The initial state is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even). After executing the code, `t` remains unchanged because it is not used in the input operation. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers input by the user.

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `k` are the integers input by the user, with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `k` are the integers input by the user, with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even.**
