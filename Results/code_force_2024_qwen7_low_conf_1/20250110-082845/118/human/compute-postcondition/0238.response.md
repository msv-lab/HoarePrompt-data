Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is either `b - 1 - l` or `b - l`, `m` is either 1 or 0, `o` is a list containing `[b]` or `[b]` possibly followed by other elements plus the value of `s` (`b - 1 - l` or `b - l`), `y` is incremented by 1. If `y % c == 0`:
- If `f >= 0`, `f` becomes 0; if `l > 2`, `l` is adjusted accordingly.
- If `f < 0`, `f` becomes either 1 or 2, and `l` remains unchanged.
Otherwise:
- If `f >= 1`, `f` becomes 0, and if `l > 2`, `l` is adjusted to `l - 1`.
- Otherwise, `f` is incremented by 1.**
