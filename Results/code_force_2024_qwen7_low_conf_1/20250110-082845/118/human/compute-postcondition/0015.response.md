`ans[j]` is assigned the value of `r`. The value of `j` is defined as `i + k`, so `ans[i + k]` is set to `r`. The values of `i`, `l`, and `r` are updated, but the value of `j` itself remains as `i + k`. The state of the other variables is unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `ans` is a list, `j` is an index (j = i + k), `l` is an integer, and `r` is an integer; ans[i + k] is r**
