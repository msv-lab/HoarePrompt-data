The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even, `l` is 1, `r` is `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements equal to 0.**
