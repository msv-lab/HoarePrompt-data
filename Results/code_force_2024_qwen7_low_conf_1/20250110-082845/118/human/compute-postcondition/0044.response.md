`r` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` remains an integer less than `n` and `k`, and `j` remains `i + k`. The value of `ans[j]` is assigned `r-1`. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`; `j` is `i + k`; `ans[j]` is assigned `r-1`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`; `j` is `i + k`; `ans[j]` is assigned `r-1`**
