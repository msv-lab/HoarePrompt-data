The variable `s` is assigned the value of `b`. The value of `b` is the first integer entered by the user. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is `a - 2`; `b` is the first integer entered by the user; `c` is the second integer entered by the user; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `s` is equal to `b`.
