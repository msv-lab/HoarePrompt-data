The code `l -= 1` decrements the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was initially unchanged, the updated value of `l` will be its original value minus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `h` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `o` now contains `[b, s]`, `f` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `l` is its original value - 1.**
