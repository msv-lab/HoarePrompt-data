`ans[j]` is assigned the value of `l`. The value of `l` was incremented by 1 if `i` was even, and the value of `r` was decremented by 1 if `i` was odd. The value of `ans[j + k]` is set to `r`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Since the exact values of `i`, `k`, and `j` are not provided, we can only express the changes in terms of these variables. However, we know that `ans[j + k]` is now equal to `r`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `ans` is a list, `j` is `j + k`, `l` is an integer, and `r` is an integer; `ans[j]` is equal to `l`; `ans[j + k]` is equal to `r`.**
