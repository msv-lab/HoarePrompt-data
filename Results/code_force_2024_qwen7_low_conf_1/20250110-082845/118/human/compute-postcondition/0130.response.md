The value of `f` is incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `h` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `o` now contains `[b, s]`, `f` is increased by 1, `y` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged.
