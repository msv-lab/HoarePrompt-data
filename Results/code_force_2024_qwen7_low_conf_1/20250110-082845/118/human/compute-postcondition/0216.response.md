Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is equal to `b - l`, `m` is either 1 or 0, `o` is a list containing `[b, s]`, `y` is incremented by 1. If `f` is greater than or equal to 1 and `l` is greater than 2, then `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` minus 1 or -1. Otherwise, `l` remains the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` or 0. If `f` is less than 1, `l` remains the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` or 0.***
