The value of `i` is even, and the initial values of `ans`, `j`, and `l` are undefined. The code increments `l` by 1. Since the initial values of `ans` and `j` are undefined, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer and its current value is even; `ans` is undefined; `j` is undefined; `l` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is an integer and its current value is even; `ans` is undefined; `j` is undefined; `l` is increased by 1**
