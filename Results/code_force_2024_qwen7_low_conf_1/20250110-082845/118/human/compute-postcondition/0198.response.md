Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is equal to `b`, `m` is either 1 or 0, `o` is a list containing `[b]` or `[b]` possibly followed by other elements, `f` is 0, and `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` or 0. If `y % c == 0`, then `m` is 1 and `o` is `[b]`. If `y % c != 0`, then `m` is 0, `o` is `[b]` possibly followed by other elements, and `l` remains unchanged based on the previous value of `f` and `l`.**
