Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is equal to `b`, `m` is 0, `o` is `[b]`, and `y` is not divisible by `c`. If `l` is 0, `l` remains 0 regardless of the value of `f`. If `l` is 1 and `f` is greater than or equal to 0, `l` remains 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0.***
