The code `l = h` assigns the value of `h` to `l`. From the initial state, we know that `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is `a - 2`; `b` is the first integer entered by the user; `c` is the second integer entered by the user; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `s` is either `b - 1` or `b`; `m` is either 1 or 2; `o` is a list containing `[b]` or `[b]` possibly followed by other elements; `f` is 0; `l` is now equal to `h` or the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `y` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is `a - 2`; `b` is the first integer entered by the user; `c` is the second integer entered by the user; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `s` is either `b - 1` or `b`; `m` is either 1 or 2; `o` is a list containing `[b]` or `[b]` possibly followed by other elements; `f` is 0; `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `y` is incremented by 1.**
