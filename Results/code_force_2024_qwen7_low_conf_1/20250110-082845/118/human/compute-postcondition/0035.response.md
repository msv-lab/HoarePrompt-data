The code snippet `ans[j] = l` assigns the value of `l` to the index `j` of the list `ans`. However, the variables `i`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this line of code. The initial state of `i` being an integer less than both `n` and `k` remains unchanged, and the value of `ans` is updated at the specific index `j`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`; `ans` is updated such that `ans[j]` is now equal to `l`**
