Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is \(a - 1\); `b` is a non-negative integer; `c` is the same as its previous value; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `s` is either `b - m` or `b` depending on whether `y % c == 0`; `m` is 2 if `b + 1` is divisible by `c` and 1 otherwise; `o` is a list containing `[b, b - m]` if `y % c == 0` and `[b, s]` otherwise; `f` is 0 if `y % c == 0` and either 0 or `f + 1` otherwise; `y` remains unchanged; `l` remains unchanged.***
