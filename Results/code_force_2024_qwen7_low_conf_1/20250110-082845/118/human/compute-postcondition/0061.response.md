Postcondition: ***`i` is `2k`, `l` is updated based on the previous logic for even or odd `k`, and `r` is updated based on the previous logic for even or odd `k`. If `i` (which is `2k`) is even, `l` is set to `previous_l + 1` and `ans[j]` for all `j` in the range `[2k, n-1, k]` is set to `previous_l + 1`. If `i` (which is `2k`) is odd, `r` is set to `r - 1` and `ans[j]` for all `j` in the range `[2k, n-1, k]` is set to `r - 1`.***
