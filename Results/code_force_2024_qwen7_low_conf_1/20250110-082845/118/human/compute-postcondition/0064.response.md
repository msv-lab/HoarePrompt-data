The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was previously defined as `previous_l + 1`, the new value of `l` will be `(previous_l + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `previous_l + 2`. The values of `i`, `r`, and `ans[j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `3k`, `l` is `previous_l + 2`, `r` is `r`, `ans[j]` is `previous_l + 1`**
