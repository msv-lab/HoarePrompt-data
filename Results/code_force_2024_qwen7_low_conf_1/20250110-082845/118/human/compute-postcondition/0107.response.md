Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is a non-negative integer (same as its previous value), `c` is the same as its previous value, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is `0`, `o` is a list containing `[b]`, `f` is `0`, `l` is the current value of `l` (which was even before the if condition), and `y` is the final value of `b`.***

Explanation: Since both the if and else parts describe the same postcondition, the overall postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition. This means that regardless of whether the if condition is true or false, the values of all the variables remain the same as described in the precondition.
