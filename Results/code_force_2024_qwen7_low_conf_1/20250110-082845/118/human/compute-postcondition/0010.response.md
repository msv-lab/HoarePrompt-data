`r` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` remains an odd integer, `ans` remains a list with `ans[j]` set to `r`, and `j` remains an index. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is an odd integer, `ans` is a list with `ans[j]` set to `r-1`, `j` is an index, and `r` is `r-1`.

Output State: **`i` is an odd integer, `ans` is a list with `ans[j]` set to `r-1`, `j` is an index, `r` is `r-1`**
