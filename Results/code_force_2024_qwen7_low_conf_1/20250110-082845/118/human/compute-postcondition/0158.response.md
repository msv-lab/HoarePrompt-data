Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is `a - 1`; `b` is a non-negative integer; `c` is the same as its previous value; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `s` is adjusted according to the remainder of `(y + 1) \% c`: it is `b - m` if `(y + 1) \% c == 0` and `b - 1` otherwise; `m` is updated to `m + 1` if `(y + 1) \% c == 0` and remains 2 if `b + 1` is divisible by `c` and 1 otherwise; `o` is a list containing `[b, b - m]` if `(y + 1) \% c == 0` and `[b, s]` otherwise, with the additional element `s - l` appended to it; `f` is 0 if `(y + 1) \% c == 0` and not incremented, or 1 if `(y + 1) \% c != 0` and `f` was initially 0 or incremented; `y` is `y + 1`; `l` remains unchanged.***
