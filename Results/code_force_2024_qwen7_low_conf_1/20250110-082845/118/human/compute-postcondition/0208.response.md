Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is equal to `b - l`, `m` is either 1 or 0, `o` is a list containing `[b, s]`, `f` is 0, `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` minus 1 or -1, and `y` is incremented by 1.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and we assume there is no other modification outside the if block, the overall postcondition remains the same as the postcondition of the if part. All the variables retain their values and relationships as specified in the if part, including `y` being incremented by 1.
