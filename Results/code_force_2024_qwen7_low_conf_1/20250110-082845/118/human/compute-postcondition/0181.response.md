Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is equal to `b`, `m` is 0, `o` is `[b]`, `f` is 0, `l` is 0, `y` is not divisible by `c`, and the current value of `f` is greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `l` is greater than 2 and even.**
