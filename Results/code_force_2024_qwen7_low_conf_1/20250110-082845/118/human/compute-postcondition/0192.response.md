Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is equal to `b`, `m` is 0, `o` is `[b]`, `f` is 1, `l` is 1 (since `l > 2` does not change the value of `l` when `l` is 1), and `y` is not divisible by `c`***
