The code snippet `print(*ans)` prints the elements of the list `ans`. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables or the state of the list `ans`. The initial values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `l` is `1 + floor((n-1)/2)` if `k` is even, or `1 + floor(n/2)` if `n` is odd, `r` is `n` if `k` is even, or `n - 1` if `n` is odd, and `ans[j]` is `l` if `i` was even, otherwise `ans[j]` is `r` for all `j` in the range `[n, n-1, k]`.**
