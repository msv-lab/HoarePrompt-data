`r` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `2k` being even or odd is used to determine the value of `l`, but since the value of `r` is updated, we need to consider the effect on `ans[j]`. The initial state indicates that `ans[j]` is equal to `r`.

Output State: **`i` is `3k`, `l` is `previous_l + 1` if `2k` was even, `r` is `r - 1` if `2k` was odd; `ans[j]` is equal to `r - 1`**
