Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is either `b - 1` or `b`, `m` is either 1 or 0, `o` is a list containing `[b]` or `[b]` possibly followed by other elements plus the value of `s` (either `b - 1` or `b`), `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `f >= 0` is true or false, `l` is either the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` or 0, and `y` is incremented by 1.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, including the changes in variables based on the condition `y % c == 0`.
