`r` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` remains less than `n` and `k`, and `ans[j]` remains `r`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`; `r` is decreased by 1; `ans[j]` is `r`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`; `r` is decreased by 1; `ans[j]` is `r`**
