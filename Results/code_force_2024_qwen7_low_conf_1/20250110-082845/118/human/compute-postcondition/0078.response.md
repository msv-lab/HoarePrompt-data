Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is an integer input with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` is even; `a` must be greater than 0; `b` is an integer input that must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer input; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `s` and `m` are updated based on the following conditions: 
- If `y % c == 0` and `m` was initially 1, then `s = b + 1` and `m = 2`; `o` contains `[b - 1, b + 1]`.
- If `y % c == 0` and `m` was initially -1, then `s = b - 1` and `m = 0`; `o` contains `[b, b - 1, b - 1]`.
- If `y % c != 0` and `m` was initially 1, then `s = b - 1` and `m = 2`; `o` contains `[b - 1, b + 1]`.
- If `y % c != 0` and `m` was initially -1, then `s = b - 1` and `m = 0`; `o` contains `[b, b - 1, b - 1]`.
- `f` is 0.
- `l` is updated based on the following rules:
  - If `l` is even, and `f >= 0` and `l > 2`, `l` is decreased by 1 and `f` remains unchanged; otherwise, `f` is increased by 1.
  - If `l` is odd, `s` is decreased by 1, `o` is updated to `[ (s - l) - 1 ]`, `l` is decreased by 1, and `f` is set to 0.***
  
This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block based on the conditions provided.
