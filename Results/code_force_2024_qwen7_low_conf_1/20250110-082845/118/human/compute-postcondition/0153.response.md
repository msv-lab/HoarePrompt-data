Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \); `a` is `a` - 1; `b` is a non-negative integer; `c` is the same as its previous value; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `s` is `s_prev - l`; `m` is 2 if `b + 1` is divisible by `c` and 1 otherwise; `o` is a list containing `[b, b - m]` if \((y + 1) \% c == 0\) and `[b, s_prev]` otherwise, with the additional element `s_prev - l` appended to it; `f` is 0 if \((y + 1) \% c == 0\) and either 0 or `f + 1` otherwise; `y` is \( y + 1 \); `l` is `l` - 1 if `l` > 2, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.***
