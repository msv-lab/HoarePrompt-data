The line `l = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `l`. This is the only assignment made in the code snippet, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is `a - 2`; `b` is the first integer entered by the user; `c` is the second integer entered by the user; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `s` is equal to `b`; `m` is 0; `o` is an empty list; `f` is 0; `l` is 0.**
