Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is \(a - 1\), `b` is a non-negative integer (same as its previous value), `c` is the same as its previous value, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is `0`, `o` is an empty list, `f` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `y` is the final value of `b`, and `y` is divisible by `c`.**
