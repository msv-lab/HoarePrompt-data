Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is a non-negative integer (same as its previous value), `c` is the same as its previous value, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is `0`, `o` is a list containing `[b]`, `l` is a non-zero integer, and `y` is the final value of `b`. Additionally, `f` is `1` if the if condition is not met, and remains `0` if the if condition is met.***
