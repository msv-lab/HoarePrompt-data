Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is equal to `b - l`, `m` is either 1 or 0, `o` is a list containing `[b, s]`, `y` is incremented by 1, and `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `f >= 0` is true or false. If `l` is even, `l` is either 0 or unchanged. If `l` is odd and greater than 2, `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` minus 1 or -1. Otherwise, `l` remains the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` or 0.***
