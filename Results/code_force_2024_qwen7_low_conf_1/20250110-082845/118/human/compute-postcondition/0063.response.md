The code snippet `ans[j] = l` assigns the value of `l` to `ans[j]`. Based on the initial state, `l` is defined as `previous_l + 1` if `2k` was even, or `previous_l` if `2k` was odd. Since `2k` is always even (as `k` is an integer), `l` is assigned `previous_l + 1`. The value of `i` is given as `3k`, which does not affect the calculation of `l`, and `r` is only modified if `2k` was odd, which is not the case here. Therefore, the value of `r` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `3k`, `l` is `previous_l + 1`, `r` is `r`, `ans[j]` is `previous_l + 1`**
