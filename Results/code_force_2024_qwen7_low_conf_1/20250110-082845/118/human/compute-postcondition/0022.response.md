`r` is decremented by 1, which means `r -= 1`. The value of `i`, `ans`, `j`, `l`, and the relationship `ans[j]` set to `r`, `j` is `j + k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer, `ans` is a list with `ans[j]` set to `r-1`, `j` is `j + k`, `l` is an integer, and `r` is an integer (decremented by 1).

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `ans` is a list with `ans[j]` set to `r-1`, `j` is `j + k`, `l` is an integer, and `r` is an integer (decremented by 1)**
