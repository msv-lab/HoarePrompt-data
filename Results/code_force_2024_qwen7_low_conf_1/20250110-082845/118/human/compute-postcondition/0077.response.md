Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer, `o` is a list containing an integer. If `l` is even, `f` is updated according to the following rules: if `f >= 0` and `l > 2`, `l` is decreased by 1 and `f` remains unchanged; if `f >= 0` and `l <= 2`, or if `f < 0`, `f` is increased by 1. If `l` is odd, `s` is decreased by 1, `o` is updated to `[ (s - l) - 1 ]`, `l` is decreased by 1, and `f` is set to 0.***
