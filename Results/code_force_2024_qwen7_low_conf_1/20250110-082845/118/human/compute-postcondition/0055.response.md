Postcondition: **`i` is `k`, `l` is the original value of `l` plus \(\left\lfloor\frac{k-2}{2}\right\rfloor + 2\) if `k` is even, or the original value of `l` plus the number of even iterations up to `k-1` if `k` is odd. Similarly, `r` is the original value of `r` minus \(\left\lfloor\frac{k-1}{2}\right\rfloor\) if `k` is even, or the original value of `r` minus the number of odd iterations up to `k-1` decreased by 1 if `k` is odd. For all `j` in the range `[k, n-1, k]`, `ans[j]` is `l` if `k` is even or `r` if `k` is odd. Additionally, `i` (which is `k`) must be less than `n` and within the range `[0, n-1]`.**
