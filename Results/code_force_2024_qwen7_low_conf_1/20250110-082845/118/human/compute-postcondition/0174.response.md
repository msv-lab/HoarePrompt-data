The variable `l` is assigned the value of `h`. From the initial state, `h` is defined as the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are unknown, so `h` remains as the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`. All other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is equal to `b`, `m` is 1, `o` is an empty list, `f` is 0, `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `y % c` is equal to 0**
