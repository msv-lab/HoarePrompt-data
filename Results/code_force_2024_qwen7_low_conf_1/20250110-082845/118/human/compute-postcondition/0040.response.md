Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`.
- If `i` is even, then `ans[j]` is set to `l + 1`.
- Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1 and `ans[j]` is set to `r`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for j in range(i, n, k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Current Value of `j`:**
   - The loop runs for values of `j` starting from `i` up to `n-1` in steps of `k`.
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be the largest value less than `n` that satisfies the condition of the loop.

2. **Check the Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` (which is `i + k`) must be within the range `[i, n)`.
   - This means `i + k < n`.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - Since `j` was the last value processed, the next value of `j` will be `i + k`.
   - The value of `i` will increment by `k` for the next iteration.

### Updated States
- `i` will be updated to `i + k`.
- The value of `j` will be `i + k`.

### Final State
- `i` must be less than `n` and `k`.
- If `i + k` is even, then `ans[j]` is set to `l + 1`.
- Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1 and `ans[j]` is set to `r`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is an integer less than `n` and `k`, `j` is `i + k`**.
