`f` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `l` is not affected because the condition `l > 2` is not specified, and no value for `l` was given in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `h` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `o` now contains `[b, s]`, `f` is 0, `y` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged.**
