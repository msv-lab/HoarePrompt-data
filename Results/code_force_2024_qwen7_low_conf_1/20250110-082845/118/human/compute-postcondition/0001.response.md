The code initializes two variables `l` and `r` to 1 and `n` respectively. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state will include the updated values of `l` and `r`, while keeping the initial values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` being even, `l` is 1, `r` is `n`.**
