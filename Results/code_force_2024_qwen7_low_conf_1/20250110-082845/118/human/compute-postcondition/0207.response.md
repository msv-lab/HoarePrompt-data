`l` is decremented by 1. The value of `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` or 0. Since the exact value of `b` and `c` is not specified, the new value of `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` minus 1 or -1 (if the original `l` was 0).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is `a - 2`, `b` is the first integer entered by the user, `c` is the second integer entered by the user, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is equal to `b - l`, `m` is either 1 or 0, `o` is a list containing `[b, s]`, `f` is 0, `l` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c` minus 1 or -1, `y` is incremented by 1.**
