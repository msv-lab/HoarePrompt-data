The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will handle a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` with specific constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 for the number of test cases, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 for each test case, and `k` is even).

The function will return a result for each test case based on the input `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases, each containing integers `n` and `k` with given constraints, and return results accordingly for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers `n` and `k` with constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (for the number of test cases), 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 (for each test case), and `k` is even, and returns results accordingly for each test case.**
