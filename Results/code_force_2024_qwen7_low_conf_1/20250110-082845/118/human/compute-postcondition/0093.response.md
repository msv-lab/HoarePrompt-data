The code `m += 1` increments the value of `m` by 1. Initially, `m` is 0, so after executing this line of code, `m` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is \(a - 1\), `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is the same as its previous value, `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is 1, `o` is an empty list, `f` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `y` is the final value of `b`, and `y` is divisible by `c`.**
