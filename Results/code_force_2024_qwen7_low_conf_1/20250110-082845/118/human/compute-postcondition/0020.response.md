The value of `l` is incremented by 1, which means `l` is now `l + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer, `ans` is a list, `j` is `j + k`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `r` is an integer; `ans[j]` is equal to `l`; `ans[j + k]` is equal to `r`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `ans` is a list, `j` is `j + k`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `r` is an integer; `ans[j]` is equal to `l`; `ans[j + k]` is equal to `r`.**
