Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is 0 since the loop executes `a` times and `a` must be greater than 0; `b` is the first integer entered by the user; `c` is the second integer entered by the user; `h` is the ceiling of `b` divided by `c`; `s` is the final value of `s` calculated during the last iteration; `m` is the total number of iterations of the loop; `o` is a list containing all the values of `s` calculated during the loop iterations; `f` is the final value of `f` after all iterations; `l` is the final value of `l` after all iterations; the loop prints the list `o`.**
