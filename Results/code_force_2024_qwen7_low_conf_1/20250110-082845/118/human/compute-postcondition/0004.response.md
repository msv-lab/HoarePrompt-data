To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the `for` loop statement `for j in range(i, n, k)`:

1. **Initialization**: The loop variable `j` is initialized to `i`.
2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.
3. **Increment**: After each iteration, `j` is incremented by `k`.

For the loop to execute at all, the following conditions must be met:
- The initial value of `j` (which is `i`) must be less than `n` to satisfy the condition of the loop.
- The step size `k` should be such that the loop can proceed, but this is typically handled within the loop itself and doesn't need explicit adjustment in the initial state unless `k` affects the termination condition directly (which isn't the case here).

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure:
- `i` is less than `n` so that the loop can start.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
