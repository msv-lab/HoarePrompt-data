The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided in the initial state, the execution of the `continue` statement does not alter any variable values or the state outside of the loop. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is `int(data[4 + n])`, `x` is the integer at `data[4 + n + 1]`, `a` is `[x]`, `index` is `4 + 2 * n + 2`, `results` is `['NO', 'YES', '2 x', f'{n - 2}']`, `gcd2` is the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`, `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`, `gcd1` is the value of `func_1(x, x)`, `and1` is `0`.**
