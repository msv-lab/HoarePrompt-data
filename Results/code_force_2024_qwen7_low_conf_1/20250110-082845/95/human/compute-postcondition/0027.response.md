The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was previously either containing `'YES'`, `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}"'` if the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` was true, or remaining unchanged if the condition was false, appending `'NO'` overrides any previous content in `results`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer `data[1]`; `x` is the integer `data[3]`; `a` is a list of integers from `data[4:4+n]` sorted in ascending order; `index` is `4 + n`; `results` is `['NO']`; `gcd2` is the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`; `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`.**
