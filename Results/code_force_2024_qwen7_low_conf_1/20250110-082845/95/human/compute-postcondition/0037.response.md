`results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. The original value of `results` was `['NO']`. After appending `'YES'`, the list becomes `['NO', 'YES']`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is `int(data[4 + n])`, `x` is the integer at `data[4 + n + 1]`, `a` is `[x]`, `index` is `4 + 2 * n + 2`, `results` is `['NO', 'YES']`, `gcd2` is the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`, `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`, `gcd1` is the value of `func_1(x, x)`, `and1` is `0`.**
