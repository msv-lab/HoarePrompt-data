`gcd1` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the last two elements of the list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order and contains integers, `a[-1]` is the largest element and `a[-2]` is the second largest element in `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `index`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1, `n` is the integer `data[1]`, `x` is the integer `data[3]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[4:4+n]` sorted in ascending order, `index` is 4 + `n`, `results` is an empty list, `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`**
