The code `continue` is used within a loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. In this context, since no loop is explicitly shown, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values or change the state of the program. Therefore, all the previous values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer `data[1]`; `x` is the integer `data[3]`; `a` is a list of integers from `data[4:4+n]` sorted in ascending order; `index` is `4 + n`; `results` is a list containing `'YES'`, `'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'`, and `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])); `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`; `and1` is the result of the bitwise AND operation on all elements in `a` except the last two; the GCD of `a[-1]` is greater than the bitwise AND of all elements in `a` except the last two plus `x`.**
