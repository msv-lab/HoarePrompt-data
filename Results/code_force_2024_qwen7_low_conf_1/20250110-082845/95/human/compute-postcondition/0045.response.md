The code appends a formatted string to the `results` list. Specifically, it adds the string representation of `n - 2` followed by the elements in `a[2:]` joined with spaces.

- `n - 2` is calculated but its specific value depends on the initial value of `n`.
- `a[2:]` refers to the slice of the list starting from index 2, which is just the element `a[2]` since `a` is defined as `[x]`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is `[x]`, so `a[2:]` is an empty list because there are no elements beyond index 1.
- `results` is `['NO', 'YES']`.

Therefore, the formatted string will be `' '`, which is essentially an empty string.

After appending this to `results`, the updated `results` list will be `['NO', 'YES', ' ']`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is `int(data[4 + n])`, `x` is the integer at `data[4 + n + 1]`, `a` is `[x]`, `index` is `4 + 2 * n + 2`, `results` is `['NO', 'YES', ' ']`, `gcd2` is 1, `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`, `gcd1` is the value of `func_1(x, x)`, `and1` is `0`.**
