The `index` variable is incremented by 1. Initially, `index` is 0, so after incrementing, `index` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 400000, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 400000, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 400000 for all i in range 0 to n-1, and `index` is 1.**
