Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 20000), `n` (an integer between 4 and 400000), `x` (an integer between 0 and 400000), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 400000). The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and the list `a`. It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order and checks two conditions involving the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and bitwise AND operations on the elements of `a`. If either condition is satisfied, it appends 'YES' along with specific indices and values to the `results` list. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it writes the contents of the `results` list, which contains the answers for all `t` test cases, to the standard output.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `t` is 1, the function will process only one test case.
- If `n` is exactly 4, the list `a` will have only four elements, and the conditions involving `a[:-2]` and `a[2:]` will be handled appropriately.
- If the GCD of the last two elements of `a` (`a[-1]` and `a[-2]`) is less than or equal to the bitwise AND of all elements except the last two (`and1`), the result for that test case will be 'NO'.
- If the GCD of all elements except the first two (`gcd2`) is less than or equal to the bitwise AND of the first two elements (`a[0]` and `a[1]`), the result for that test case will also be 'NO'.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input `data` is already correctly formatted and contains the necessary test cases. There is no validation or error handling for invalid input formats or out-of-bound indices in the `data` list.
