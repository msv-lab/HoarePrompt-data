The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop or iteration structure in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer `data[1]`; `x` is the integer `data[3]`; `a` is a list of integers from `data[4:4+n]` sorted in ascending order; `index` is `4 + n`; `results` is a list containing `'YES'`, `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`, and `'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}"'; `gcd2` is the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`; `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`.**
