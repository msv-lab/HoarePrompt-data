The code appends a formatted string to the `results` list. The string `'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'` will be appended, where `{a[-1]}` is the last element of the list `a` and `{a[-2]}` is the second last element of the list `a`. Given the initial state, let's determine the specific values:

- `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2.
- `n` is `int(data[4 + n])`.
- `x` is the integer at `data[4 + n + 1]`.
- `a` is `[x]`.
- `index` is `4 + 2 * n + 2`.
- `results` is `['NO', 'YES']`.
- `gcd2` is the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`.
- `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`.
- `gcd1` is the value of `func_1(x, x)`.
- `and1` is `0`.

Since `a` is defined as `[x]`, `a[-1]` is `x` and `a[-2]` does not exist (the list only contains one element), so `{a[-2]}` will be treated as an empty string in the formatted string.

Therefore, the formatted string `'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'` becomes `'2 x'`.

After appending this string to `results`, the updated `results` will be `['NO', 'YES', '2 x']`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is `int(data[4 + n])`, `x` is the integer at `data[4 + n + 1]`, `a` is `[x]`, `index` is `4 + 2 * n + 2`, `results` is `['NO', 'YES', '2 x']`, `gcd2` is the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`, `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`, `gcd1` is the value of `func_1(x, x)`, `and1` is `0`.**
