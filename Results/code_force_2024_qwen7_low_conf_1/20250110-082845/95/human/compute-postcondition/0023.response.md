The code appends a formatted string to the `results` list. The string is composed of `n - 2` followed by the elements of the subarray `a[2:]` joined with spaces. 

Let's break down the variables and their states before and after the execution:

- `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged except for the content of the slice `a[2:]`, which will be included in the string.
- `index` remains unchanged.
- `gcd2` remains unchanged.
- `and2` remains unchanged.
- `results` now contains the original `'YES'` plus the new string `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer `data[1]`; `x` is the integer `data[3]`; `a` is a list of integers from `data[4:4+n]` sorted in ascending order; `index` is `4 + n`; `results` is a list containing `'YES'` and the string `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:]))`; `gcd2` is the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`; `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`.**
