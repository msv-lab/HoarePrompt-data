`results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer `data[1]`; `x` is the integer `data[3]`; `a` is a list of integers from `data[4:4+n]` sorted in ascending order; `index` is `4 + n`; `results` is a list containing `'YES'`; `gcd2` is the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`; `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]; (gcd2 > and2 + x)` is true.**
