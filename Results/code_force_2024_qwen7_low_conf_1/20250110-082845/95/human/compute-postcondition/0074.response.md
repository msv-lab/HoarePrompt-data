The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a`. The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20000, the parameter `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 400000, the parameter `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 400000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 400000 for all i in range 0 to n-1.

The function has two cases based on the output:

Case_1: `number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative;
Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".

However, since there are no specific outputs given for `func_2` directly related to the parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a`, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept the parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a` with their respective constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20000), `n` (an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 400000), `x` (an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 400000), and `a` (a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 400000 for all i in range 0 to n-1).**
