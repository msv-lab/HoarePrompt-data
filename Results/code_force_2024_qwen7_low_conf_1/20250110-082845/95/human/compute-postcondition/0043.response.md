Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact on the variables:

1. The initial state includes the following variables and their values:
   - `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2.
   - `n` is `int(data[4 + n])`.
   - `x` is the integer at `data[4 + n + 1]`.
   - `a` is `[x]`.
   - `index` is `4 + 2 * n + 2`.
   - `results` is either `['NO', 'YES', '2 x', f'{n - 2}']` or remains `['NO']`.
   - `gcd2` is 1.
   - `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`.
   - `gcd1` is the value of `func_1(x, x)`.
   - `and1` is `0`.

2. The code snippet `and2 = a[0] & a[1]` is executed. Since `a` is initially `[x]`, the subarray `a[2:]` is empty, and `a[1]` does not exist, the operation `a[0] & a[1]` results in a TypeError because there is no second element in the list to perform the bitwise AND operation with the first element.

3. However, since the question asks to update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code and the operation itself results in an error, we assume the operation is not performed and the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is `int(data[4 + n])`, `x` is the integer at `data[4 + n + 1]`, `a` is `[x]`, `index` is `4 + 2 * n + 2`, `results` is either `['NO', 'YES', '2 x', f'{n - 2}']` or remains `['NO']`, `gcd2` is 1, `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`, `gcd1` is the value of `func_1(x, x)`, `and1` is `0`.**
