The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, appending `'YES'` to it will make `results` contain one element: `'YES'`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The conditions regarding the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `index`, `gcd1`, and `and1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer `data[1]`; `x` is the integer `data[3]`; `a` is a list of integers from `data[4:4+n]` sorted in ascending order; `index` is `4 + n`; `results` is a list containing `'YES'`; `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`; `and1` is the result of the bitwise AND operation on all elements in `a` except the last two; the GCD of `a[-1]` is greater than the bitwise AND of all elements in `a` except the last two plus `x`**
