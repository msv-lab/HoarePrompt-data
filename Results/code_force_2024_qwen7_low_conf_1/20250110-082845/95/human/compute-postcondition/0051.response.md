The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is data[0] - 1
- `n` is int(data[4 + n])
- `x` is the integer at data[4 + n + 1]
- `a` is [x]
- `index` is 4 + 2 * n + 2
- `results` is either ['NO', 'NO', '2 x', f'{n - 2}'] or ['NO', 'NO', ' ', '2 {x} {x}']
- `gcd2` is 1
- `and2` is a[0] & a[1]
- `gcd1` is the value of func_1(x, x)
- `and1` is 0

The only change is to `n`. Since `index` is defined as `4 + 2 * n + 2`, and now `n` is updated to `int(data[index])`, `index` will also change. However, the exact value of `index` after this change depends on the new value of `n`.

Given the new value of `n`, the new `index` will be `4 + 2 * n + 2`.

The output state will reflect the change in `n` and the subsequent change in `index`:

Output State: **`t` is data[0] - 1, `n` is int(data[index]), `x` is the integer at data[4 + n + 1], `a` is [x], `index` is 4 + 2 * n + 2, `results` is either ['NO', 'NO', '2 x', f'{n - 2}'] or ['NO', 'NO', ' ', '2 {x} {x}'], `gcd2` is 1, `and2` is a[0] & a[1], `gcd1` is the value of func_1(x, x), `and1` is 0**
