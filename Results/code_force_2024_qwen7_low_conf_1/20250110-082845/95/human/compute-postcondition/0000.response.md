The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `index`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20000, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 400000, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 400000, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 400000 for all i in range 0 to n-1, and `index` is 0.**
