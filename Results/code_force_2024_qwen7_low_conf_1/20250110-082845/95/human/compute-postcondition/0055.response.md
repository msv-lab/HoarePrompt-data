The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. The initial value of `index` is `6 + 2 * n`, so after the increment, the value of `index` becomes `(6 + 2 * n) + n`, which simplifies to `6 + 3 * n`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `index` and keeps the values of the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `data[0] - 1`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `x` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `a` is `list(map(int, data[6 + 2 * n:6 + 3 * n]))`, `index` is `6 + 3 * n`, `results` is either `['NO', 'NO', '2 x', f'{n - 2}']` or `['NO', 'NO', ' ', '2 {x} {x}']`, `gcd2` is `1`, `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`, `gcd1` is the value of `func_1(x, x)`, `and1` is `0**
