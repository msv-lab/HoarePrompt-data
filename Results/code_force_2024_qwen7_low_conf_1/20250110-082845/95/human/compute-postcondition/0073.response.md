The given code snippet writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, each element separated by a newline. However, this operation does not modify any of the existing variables; it only outputs their current values. Therefore, the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `index`, `results`, `gcd1`, `and1`, `gcd2`, and `and2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that `4 ≤ n ≤ 400000`, `x` is an integer such that `0 ≤ x ≤ 400000`, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `index` is `4 + 3 * (t - 1)`, `results` is a list of strings containing 'NO' repeated `t` times, possibly interspersed with 'YES' and the corresponding indices and values from the loop executions, `gcd1` is the GCD of the last two elements of `a`, `and1` is the bitwise AND of all elements except the last two, `gcd2` is the GCD of all elements except the first two, `and2` is the bitwise AND of the first two elements.**
