Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer `data[1]`; `x` is the integer `data[3]`; `a` is a list of integers from `data[4:4+n]` sorted in ascending order; `index` is `4 + n`; `results` is an empty list; `gcd1` is the GCD of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`; `and1` is the result of the bitwise AND operation on all elements in `a` except the last two; the GCD of `a[-1]` is greater than the bitwise AND of all elements in `a` except the last two plus `x`***
