The code `gcd2 = reduce(gcd, a[2:])` calculates the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`. Given that `a` is initially `[x]`, the subarray `a[2:]` is empty, and the GCD of an empty array is defined as 1. Therefore, `gcd2` is assigned the value 1.

Other variables are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is `int(data[4 + n])`, `x` is the integer at `data[4 + n + 1]`, `a` is `[x]`, `index` is `4 + 2 * n + 2`, `results` is either `['NO', 'YES', '2 x', f'{n - 2}']` or remains `['NO']`, `gcd2` is 1, `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`, `gcd1` is the value of `func_1(x, x)`, `and1` is `0`.
