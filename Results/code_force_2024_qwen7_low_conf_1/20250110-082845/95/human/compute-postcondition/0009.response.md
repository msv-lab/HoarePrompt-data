The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Given the initial state where `index` is 4 and `n` is the integer `data[1]`, the value of `index` will be updated to `4 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1, `n` is the integer `data[1]`, `x` is the integer `data[3]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[4:4+n]`, `index` is 4 + `n`, `results` is an empty list**
