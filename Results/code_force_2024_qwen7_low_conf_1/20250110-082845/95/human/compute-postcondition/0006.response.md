The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `x`. Given the initial state, `index` is 2, so `data[index + 1]` corresponds to `data[3]`. Therefore, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[3]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1, `n` is the integer `data[1]`, `x` is the integer `data[3]`, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 400000 for all i in range 0 to n-1, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**
