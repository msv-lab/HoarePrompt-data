The code assigns `gcd1` the value of the function `func_1` applied to `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `gcd1`. However, we know the following:

- `a[-1]` refers to the last element in list `a`, which is `x`.
- `a[-2]` refers to the second last element in list `a`, which is also `x` since `a` is defined as `[x]`.

Given this, `gcd1` is assigned the value of `func_1(x, x)`. Since `x` is the same for both arguments, `gcd1` will be the value returned by `func_1` when given the same argument twice. 

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is `int(data[4 + n])`, `x` is the integer at `data[4 + n + 1]`, `a` is `[x]`, `index` is `4 + 2 * n + 2`, `results` is `['NO']`, `gcd2` is the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`, `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`, `gcd1` is the value of `func_1(x, x)`**
