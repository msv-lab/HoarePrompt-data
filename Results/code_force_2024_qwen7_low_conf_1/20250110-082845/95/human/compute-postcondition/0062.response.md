The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the execution of `continue` does not change any variable values. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is `data[0] - 1`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `x` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `a` is the sorted list `list(map(int, data[6 + 2 * n:6 + 3 * n]))`, `index` is `6 + 3 * n`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', '2 x', f'{n - 2}', 'YES', f'{n - 2} {a[:-2]}']` (or `['NO', 'NO', ' ', '2 {x} {x}', 'YES', f'{n - 2} {a[:-2]}']`), `gcd2` is `1`, `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`, `gcd1` is `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`, `and1` is the result of `reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])`**
