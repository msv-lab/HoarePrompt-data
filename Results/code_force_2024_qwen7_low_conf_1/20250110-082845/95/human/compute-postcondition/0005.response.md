The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `index` is 1, so `n` will take the value of `data[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 1, `n` is the integer `data[1]`, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 400000, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 400000 for all i in range 0 to n-1, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**
