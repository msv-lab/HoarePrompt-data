`index` is incremented by `n`. The previous value of `index` was `4 + n + 2`, so adding `n` to it results in `index` becoming `4 + 2 * n + 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be at least 2, `n` is `int(data[4 + n])`, `x` is the integer at `data[4 + n + 1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements from `data[4 + n + 2 : 4 + 2 * n + 2]` to integers, `index` is `4 + 2 * n + 2`, `results` is `['NO']`, `gcd2` is the GCD of the subarray `a[2:]`, `and2` is `a[0] & a[1]`**
