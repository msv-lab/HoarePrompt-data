The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the existing variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, or `index`. Therefore, the only update is to the new variable `results`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 400000, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 400000, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 400000 for all i in range 0 to n-1, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
