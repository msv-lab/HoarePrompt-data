`t` is assigned the value of `data[index]`, which is an integer. The value of `data[index]` replaces the current value of `t`. The value of `index` remains unchanged, and all other variables (`n`, `x`, and `a`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[index]`, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 400000, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 400000, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 400000 for all i in range 0 to n-1, and `index` is 0.**
