The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 20000), `n` (an integer between 4 and 400000), `x` (an integer between 0 and 400000), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 400000). The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and the list `a`. It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order and checks two conditions involving the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and bitwise AND operations on the elements of `a`. If either condition is satisfied, it appends 'YES' along with specific indices and values to the `results` list. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it writes the contents of the `results` list, which contains the answers for all `t` test cases, to the standard output.
