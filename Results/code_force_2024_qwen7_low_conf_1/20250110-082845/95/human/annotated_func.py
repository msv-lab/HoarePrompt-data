#State of the program right berfore the function call: `a` is a list of integers, `b` is an integer such that the length of `a` is greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 400000, and the value of `b` is between 0 and 400000 inclusive.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers, and `b`, which is an integer such that the length of `a` is between 4 and 400000 inclusive, and `b` is between 0 and 400000 inclusive. The function performs the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. However, due to a logical error in the code, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped repeatedly without ever updating the values correctly for the GCD calculation. As a result, both `a` and `b` end up being set to 0 after the loop, and the function returns 0. This function will always return 0 regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b` because the GCD computation is flawed. Potential edge cases include when `b` is initially 0, in which case the loop should terminate immediately, but this is not handled correctly in the given code.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 20000), `n` (an integer between 4 and 400000), `x` (an integer between 0 and 400000), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 400000). The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and the list `a`. It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order and checks two conditions involving the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and bitwise AND operations on the elements of `a`. If either condition is satisfied, it appends 'YES' along with specific indices and values to the `results` list. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it writes the contents of the `results` list, which contains the answers for all `t` test cases, to the standard output.
