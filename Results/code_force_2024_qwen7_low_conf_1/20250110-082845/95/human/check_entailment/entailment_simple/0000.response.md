Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is a basic implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers. However, the problem requires calculating the GCD of multiple numbers. The program uses `func_1` incorrectly by passing two elements at a time instead of computing the GCD of the entire sublist of red numbers.

2. **Bitwise AND Calculation:**
   - The bitwise AND operation is computed correctly using `reduce`. However, this operation is applied to the entire list of blue numbers. The problem states that Kirill should choose a subset of 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircle them in red, which implies that the rest will automatically be blue. The current implementation does not correctly identify and separate these subsets.

3. **Logic Flow:**
   - The program does not properly handle the selection of 2 to (n-2) numbers for Kirill to encircle in red. Instead, it either takes the last two or the first two elements without ensuring that the selection adheres to the rules specified in the problem.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" correctly, but the format for the indices and values is incorrect. Specifically, it does not correctly identify and print the indices of the chosen numbers for Kirill and the numbers for Anton.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

- According to the problem, Kirill can choose any 2 to 3 numbers to encircle in red. For instance, he could choose the first three numbers `[1, 1, 1]`.
- The GCD of `[1, 1, 1]` is `1`.
- The bitwise AND of the remaining numbers `[1, 1]` is `1`.
- Since `1` (GCD) is not strictly greater than `1 + 1`, Kirill loses.

However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly and might choose the last two numbers `[1, 1]` instead of the first three, leading to an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement and fails to handle the selection of numbers for Kirill and Anton according to the rules specified. Therefore, the program is not correct.
