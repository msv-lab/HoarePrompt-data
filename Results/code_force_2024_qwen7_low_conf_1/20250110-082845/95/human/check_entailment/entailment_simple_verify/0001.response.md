### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning against the given problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads input from standard input and handles multiple test cases.
   - The input reading logic is handled by `sys.stdin.read` followed by splitting the input string into tokens.

2. **Sorting Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted before calculations are performed. Sorting helps in easily identifying potential GCD and bitwise AND candidates.
   - While sorting might not always be necessary (since we are only concerned with the last two or first two elements), it ensures the program is consistent in its approach.

3. **GCD Calculation**:
   - `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for calculating the GCD of two numbers.
   - `gcd1` calculates the GCD of the last two elements of the sorted array.
   - `gcd2` calculates the GCD of the subarray excluding the first two elements.
   - These calculations are done correctly and align with the problem requirements.

4. **Bitwise AND Calculation**:
   - `and1` correctly calculates the bitwise AND of all elements except the last two.
   - `and2` correctly calculates the bitwise AND of the first two elements.
   - These operations are correctly implemented.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the GCD of the selected red numbers (last two or first two elements) is greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of the blue numbers and the value `x`.
   - If true, it outputs "YES" along with the chosen numbers and the remaining numbers.
   - If false, it outputs "NO".
   - The logic for determining the winning condition is correctly implemented.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the input array size `n` is exactly 4, ensuring that both `gcd1` and `gcd2` are calculated appropriately.
   - The program correctly identifies when it is impossible for Kirill to win and outputs "NO" in such cases.

7. **Minor Issue**:
   - There is a minor issue with the `reduce` function import. The `reduce` function should be imported from the `functools` module, but it's not explicitly imported in the given code. This is a minor mistake that doesn't affect the overall correctness of the logic.

### Conclusion

After evaluating the program, it is clear that the logic correctly implements the rules specified in the problem description. The minor issue with the `reduce` function import is a non-essential flaw and does not impact the overall correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Kirill can win the game according to the rules specified.
