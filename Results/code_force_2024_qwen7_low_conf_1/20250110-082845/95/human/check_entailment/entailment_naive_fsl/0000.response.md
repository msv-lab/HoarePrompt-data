Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD**: The `func_1` function for calculating GCD uses an iterative approach which is correct, but the usage of this function needs to be corrected. The `reduce` function is used incorrectly in the `func_2` function. Specifically, `reduce(func_1, a[:-2])` should be used to calculate the GCD of all elements except the last two.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Bitwise AND**: The calculation of the bitwise AND (`and1`) should include all but the first two elements, and the bitwise AND of the first two elements (`a[0] & a[1]`) should be calculated separately.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program assumes that the input is provided in a specific format (`data`), but it does not read the input properly. The input should be read from standard input or from a file based on the problem statement.

Here is a revised version of the function to fix these issues:

```python
import math
from functools import reduce

# Function 1: Calculate GCD
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Function 2: Main logic
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Calculate GCD of the last two elements
        gcd1 = func_1(a[-1], a[-2])
        
        # Calculate bitwise AND of all but the first two elements
        and1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])
        
        # Check if Kirill wins with the last two elements
        if gcd1 > and1 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))
            continue
        
        # Calculate GCD of all but the first two elements
        gcd2 = reduce(func_1, a[2:])
        
        # Calculate bitwise AND of the first two elements
        and2 = a[0] & a[1]
        
        # Check if Kirill wins with the first two elements
        if gcd2 > and2 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:])))
            results.append(f'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}')
            continue
        
        results.append('NO')
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function
func_2()
```

This revised code should handle the input correctly and ensure that the logic aligns with the problem description. However, since the original code did not handle the input correctly and had logical errors, it was marked as incorrect.
