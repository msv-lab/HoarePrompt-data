You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In the evenings during the hike, Kirill and Anton decided to take out an array
of integers a of length n from their backpack and play a game with it. The
rules are as follows:

  1. Kirill chooses from 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.
  2. Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
  3. Kirill calculates the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) of all the red numbers.
  4. Anton calculates the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the blue numbers and adds the number x to the result.
  5. If the GCD of all the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of all the blue numbers and the number x , then Kirill wins; otherwise, Anton wins.

Help Kirill to beat Anton or tell if it's impossible.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 20\,000 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (4\le n \le
4\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 4\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of integers and the
number x respectively.

The second line contains an array a of length n (1 \le a_i \le 4\cdot 10^5 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4\cdot
10^5 . It is also guaranteed that the sum of the maximum values of a_i for
each test case does not exceed 4\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" on the first line if the condition can be
met, on the second line, output the number of chosen numbers by Kirill and the
numbers themselves in any order separated by a space, and on the third line,
output the size of the second set and the numbers in it.

Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 20000), `n` (an integer between 4 and 400000), `x` (an integer between 0 and 400000), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 400000). The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and the list `a`. It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order and checks two conditions involving the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and bitwise AND operations on the elements of `a`. If either condition is satisfied, it appends 'YES' along with specific indices and values to the `results` list. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it writes the contents of the `results` list, which contains the answers for all `t` test cases, to the standard output.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD**: The `func_1` function for calculating GCD uses an iterative approach which is correct, but the usage of this function needs to be corrected. The `reduce` function is used incorrectly in the `func_2` function. Specifically, `reduce(func_1, a[:-2])` should be used to calculate the GCD of all elements except the last two.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Bitwise AND**: The calculation of the bitwise AND (`and1`) should include all but the first two elements, and the bitwise AND of the first two elements (`a[0] & a[1]`) should be calculated separately.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program assumes that the input is provided in a specific format (`data`), but it does not read the input properly. The input should be read from standard input or from a file based on the problem statement.

Here is a revised version of the function to fix these issues:

```python
import math
from functools import reduce

# Function 1: Calculate GCD
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Function 2: Main logic
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Calculate GCD of the last two elements
        gcd1 = func_1(a[-1], a[-2])
        
        # Calculate bitwise AND of all but the first two elements
        and1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])
        
        # Check if Kirill wins with the last two elements
        if gcd1 > and1 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))
            continue
        
        # Calculate GCD of all but the first two elements
        gcd2 = reduce(func_1, a[2:])
        
        # Calculate bitwise AND of the first two elements
        and2 = a[0] & a[1]
        
        # Check if Kirill wins with the first two elements
        if gcd2 > and2 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:])))
            results.append(f'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}')
            continue
        
        results.append('NO')
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function
func_2()
```

This revised code should handle the input correctly and ensure that the logic aligns with the problem description. However, since the original code did not handle the input correctly and had logical errors, it was marked as incorrect.
