Reasoning:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases as required.
2. **Sorting Array**: The array `a` is sorted, which is unnecessary since the problem does not specify the need for sorting. Sorting the array could potentially lead to different results due to the order of elements, especially when calculating the GCD and bitwise AND.
3. **GCD Calculation**:
   - `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - In the main function, the GCD of the last two elements (`gcd1 = func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`) and the GCD of the first part of the array after excluding the last two elements (`gcd2 = reduce(gcd, a[2:])`) are calculated. These calculations are correct and relevant to the problem.
4. **Bitwise AND Calculation**:
   - `and1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])` correctly calculates the bitwise AND of all elements except the last two.
   - `and2 = a[0] & a[1]` calculates the bitwise AND of the first two elements. This is correct and relevant to the problem.
5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the GCD of the selected red numbers is greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of the blue numbers and the value `x`.
   - If true, it outputs "YES" along with the chosen numbers and the remaining numbers.
   - If false, it outputs "NO".
   
However, there are a few potential issues with the implementation:
- **Unnecessary Sorting**: Sorting the array is not necessary and could affect the performance. The problem does not specify that the array needs to be sorted, and sorting might introduce errors in certain scenarios.
- **Incorrect `reduce` Import**: The `reduce` function is used without importing it from the `functools` module. While this is a minor issue, it could lead to confusion and potential bugs if the user imports the `reduce` function from elsewhere.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The current implementation does not handle edge cases well. For instance, if the array has only four elements, the program would incorrectly process it as if it had more elements.

Given these points, the program is not fully correct. The sorting step is unnecessary and could introduce errors, and the `reduce` function should be properly imported. Additionally, the program does not handle edge cases appropriately.

Final: **False**
