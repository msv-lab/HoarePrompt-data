You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the evenings during the hike, Kirill and Anton decided to take out an array
of integers a of length n from their backpack and play a game with it. The
rules are as follows:

  1. Kirill chooses from 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.
  2. Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
  3. Kirill calculates the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) of all the red numbers.
  4. Anton calculates the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the blue numbers and adds the number x to the result.
  5. If the GCD of all the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of all the blue numbers and the number x , then Kirill wins; otherwise, Anton wins.

Help Kirill to beat Anton or tell if it's impossible.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 20\,000 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (4\le n \le
4\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 4\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of integers and the
number x respectively.

The second line contains an array a of length n (1 \le a_i \le 4\cdot 10^5 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4\cdot
10^5 . It is also guaranteed that the sum of the maximum values of a_i for
each test case does not exceed 4\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" on the first line if the condition can be
met, on the second line, output the number of chosen numbers by Kirill and the
numbers themselves in any order separated by a space, and on the third line,
output the size of the second set and the numbers in it.

Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `a` is a list of integers, `b` is an integer such that the length of `a` is greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 400000, and the value of `b` is between 0 and 400000 inclusive.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers, and `b`, which is an integer such that the length of `a` is between 4 and 400000 inclusive, and `b` is between 0 and 400000 inclusive. The function performs the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. However, due to a logical error in the code, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped repeatedly without ever updating the values correctly for the GCD calculation. As a result, both `a` and `b` end up being set to 0 after the loop, and the function returns 0. This function will always return 0 regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b` because the GCD computation is flawed. Potential edge cases include when `b` is initially 0, in which case the loop should terminate immediately, but this is not handled correctly in the given code.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20000, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 400000, x is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 400000, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 400000 for all i in range 0 to n-1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 20000), `n` (an integer between 4 and 400000), `x` (an integer between 0 and 400000), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 400000). The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and the list `a`. It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order and checks two conditions involving the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and bitwise AND operations on the elements of `a`. If either condition is satisfied, it appends 'YES' along with specific indices and values to the `results` list. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it writes the contents of the `results` list, which contains the answers for all `t` test cases, to the standard output.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads input correctly and handles multiple test cases as required.
2. **Sorting Array**: The array `a` is sorted, which is a good start but may not always be necessary.
3. **GCD Calculation**: 
   - `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - In the main function, it attempts to calculate the GCD of the last two elements (`gcd1 = func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`) and the GCD of the first part of the array after excluding the last two elements (`gcd2 = reduce(gcd, a[2:])`).
4. **Bitwise AND Calculation**:
   - `and1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])` correctly calculates the bitwise AND of all elements except the last two.
   - `and2 = a[0] & a[1]` calculates the bitwise AND of the first two elements.
5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the GCD of the selected red numbers is greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of the blue numbers and the value `x`.
   - If true, it outputs "YES" along with the chosen numbers and the remaining numbers.
   - If false, it outputs "NO".

Given this analysis, the logic in the program seems to correctly implement the rules specified in the problem. However, there is a small issue with the `reduce` function import. The `reduce` function should be imported from the `functools` module, but it's not explicitly imported in the given code. This is a minor mistake that doesn't affect the overall correctness of the logic.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Kirill can win the game according to the rules specified.
