Postcondition: ***`counter`, `i`, and `last_index` are updated as follows: 
- If `counter > x[i]`, then `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`, `i` is `last_index + 2`, and `last_index` is `last_index + 1`.
- If `counter <= x[i]`, then `last_index` is updated to `last_index + 1`, and `i` is updated to either `last_index + 2` or `last_index + 3` depending on whether `counter` is less than `x[i]`. If `counter < x[i]`, then `counter` is set to `x[last_index + 2]`. Otherwise, `counter` is set to `x[last_index + 3] * 2`.***
