`counter` is reassigned the value of `x[i]`. Since `x[i]` is less than or equal to `counter` and `counter` was previously less than `x[i]`, this assignment does not change the relative values between `counter` and `x[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `counter` is `x[i]`, `i` is 1, the length of `x` is at least 2, and `x[i]` is less than or equal to `counter`.**
