`x` is assigned a new value through a list comprehension where each element is an integer from the input split by spaces. The previous value of `x` is a list of integers, and `n` is an integer value entered by the user, and `n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

After executing the code, `x` is updated to a list of integers from the input, and the other variables retain their original values. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `x` is a list of integers from the input, and `i` is `n_tests`.**
