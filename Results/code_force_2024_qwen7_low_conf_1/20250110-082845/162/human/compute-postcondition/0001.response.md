According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n_tests`. The loop will execute if `n_tests` is at least 1. Given the constraint `1 ≤ n_tests ≤ 1000`, we know that `n_tests` must be a positive integer.

Before the loop starts, the states of other variables like `t` (which is constrained by `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`) do not affect the ability of the loop to execute. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `n_tests` to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000**
