Postcondition: ***`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `x` is a list with more than one element, and `counter` is updated as follows: if there exists an index `i` such that `x[i]` is equal to 1, then `counter` is set to `x[0] + 1`. Otherwise, `counter` is either `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])` (if `counter > x[i]` for some index `i`), `1` (if `counter < x[i]` for some index `i`), or `2 * x[i]` (if `counter` is less than `x[i]` for some index `i`).***
