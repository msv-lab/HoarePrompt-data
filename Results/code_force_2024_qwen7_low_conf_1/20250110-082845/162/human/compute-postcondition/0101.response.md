First, let's understand the initial state and the given code snippet:

- Initial State: `i` is 4, `last_index` is 0, `x` is a list of integers (the exact content of the list is not specified, but we will assume it's part of the input string which is not further defined in the problem).
- Code: `counter = x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`

To proceed, we need to know the value of `x[i]` and the current value of `counter`. However, since `counter` is not initialized, let's assume its initial value is 0 for the sake of calculation.

Given `i` is 4, we need the value of `x[4]`. Let's denote the value of `x[4]` as `val`.

Now, the equation becomes:
`counter = val * ceil(0 / val)`

Since `counter` is initially 0, `ceil(0 / val)` is `ceil(0)`, which is 0. So, the equation simplifies to:
`counter = val * 0 = 0`

Therefore, the value of `counter` remains 0, and the other variables (`i` and `last_index`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `last_index` is 0, `counter` is 0**
