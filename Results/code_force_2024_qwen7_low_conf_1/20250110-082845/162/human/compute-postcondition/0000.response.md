The code `n_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the user and assigns it to the variable `n_tests`. This means that `t` is no longer directly referenced in the code, and its value is not known anymore. However, the precondition that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000` remains valid for the next potential test cases.

Output State: **`n_tests` is an input integer; `1 ≤ n_tests ≤ 1000`; `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`**
