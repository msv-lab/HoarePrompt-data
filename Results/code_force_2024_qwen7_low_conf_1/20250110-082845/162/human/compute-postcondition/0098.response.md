Postcondition: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `last_index` is 0, `x` remains the same list of integers obtained from the input string. If `x[3]` is 1, then `counter` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `counter` is greater than `x[3]`, then `counter` is updated to `counter * ceil(counter / x[3])`. If `counter` is less than `x[3]`, `counter` remains unchanged. If `counter` is greater than or equal to `x[3]`, then `counter` is set to `x[3] * 2`.**
