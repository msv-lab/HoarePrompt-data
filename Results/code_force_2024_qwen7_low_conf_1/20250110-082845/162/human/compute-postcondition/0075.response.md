The code snippet reads a line of space-separated integers from input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer. This affects the variable `x`. The original value of `x` was `[x[0], ..., x[-1]]`, where `x[0]` was `counter` and the rest of the elements were unspecified. After executing the code, `x` will be a new list of integers obtained from the input.

Let's denote the input as `input_str`, which is a string containing space-separated integers. The code then creates a new list `x` where each element is converted from a string in `input_str` to an integer.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `counter` is `x[0]`, `i` is 2, `last_index` is 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input string**
