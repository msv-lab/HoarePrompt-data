The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Initially, `counter` is equal to `x[0]`. After the increment, `counter` becomes `x[0] + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `x` must have more than one element, `counter` is equal to `x[0] + 1`, there exists an index `i` such that `x[i]` is equal to 1**
