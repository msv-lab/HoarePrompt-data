Postcondition: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, and the length of `x` is at least 2. If `x[i]` is equal to 1, `x[i]` remains unchanged and `counter` is updated to `counter + 1`. If `x[i]` is not equal to 1, then either `counter` is updated to its original value `C` where `C > X` and `X = x[i]`, or `counter` is set to `2 * x[1]` and both `n_tests` and `n` retain their original values.**
