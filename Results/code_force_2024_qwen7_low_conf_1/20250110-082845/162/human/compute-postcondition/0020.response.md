`counter` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `counter` is unknown. The values of the other variables (`n_tests`, `n`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `counter` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `counter` is increased by 1.**
