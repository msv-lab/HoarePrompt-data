Postcondition: ***`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `counter` is either `x[0] * ceil(x[0] / x[2])` if `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, or `counter` is either equal to `x[2]` or `x[2] * 2`, `i` is 2, `last_index` is 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `i` is less than or equal to `len(x)`, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1.***
