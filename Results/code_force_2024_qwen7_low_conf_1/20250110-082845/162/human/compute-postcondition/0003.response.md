`x` is assigned the list comprehension which splits the input into integers. The input is expected to be space-separated integers. The length of this list will be equal to `n_tests`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the input for the list comprehension is taken separately. The output state includes the updated value of `x` and the unchanged values of `n_tests` and `n`.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
