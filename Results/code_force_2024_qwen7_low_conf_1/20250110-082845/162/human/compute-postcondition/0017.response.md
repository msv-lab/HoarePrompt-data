Postcondition: ***`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with the first element being `counter`, and `i` is 1. The length of `x` is at least 2, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1. If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, then `counter` is updated to its original value `C` where `C > X` and `X = x[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` is set to `2 * x[1]` and both `n_tests` and `n` retain their original values.***
