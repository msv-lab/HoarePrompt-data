The code `print(counter)` simply prints the value of the variable `counter`. Since the value of `counter` was set before this line of code and no changes are made to `counter` in this line, the output of the print statement is the current value of `counter`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `counter` is the value printed by the print statement, `i` is `len(x)`, `last_index` is 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input string**
