The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This parameter represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. This parameter represents the number of integers in the current test case.
- For each of the `n` integers, `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. These parameters represent a list of integers for each test case.

The output of the function depends on the specific implementation within the function body, but based on the given constraints and relationships, the function likely processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and a list of integers `a_i` where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of integers in each test case, and each `a_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The function returns a result based on the processing of these parameters for each test case.**
