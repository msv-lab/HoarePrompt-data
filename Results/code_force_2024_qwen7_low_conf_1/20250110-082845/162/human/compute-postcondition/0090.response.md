Postcondition: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `counter` is either incremented by 1 if `x[2]` is 1, or updated to one of the following states: `x[0] * ceil(x[0] / x[2])` if `counter` is greater than `x[2]`, or `x[2]` or `x[2] * 2` otherwise, `i` is 2, `last_index` is 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, and `i` is less than or equal to `len(x)`**
