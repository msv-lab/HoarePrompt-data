The code `counter = x[i] * 2` updates the value of `counter`. From the initial state, `i` is defined as `last_index + 1`. However, the specific value of `last_index` is not provided, so `i` will be `last_index + 1`. The value of `x[i]` is used to calculate `counter`, which is then doubled. Since the exact value of `x[i]` is not specified, we can only express `counter` in terms of `x[i]`.

The states of other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `x` is a list with more than one element, `i` is `last_index + 1`, `counter` is `x[i] * 2`, `last_index` is unchanged.**
