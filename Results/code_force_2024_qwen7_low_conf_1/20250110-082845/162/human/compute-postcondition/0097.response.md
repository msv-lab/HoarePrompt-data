Postcondition: ***`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `last_index` is 0, `x` remains the same list of integers obtained from the input string. If `counter` is greater than `x[3]`, then `counter` is updated to `counter * ceil(counter / x[3])`. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged if `counter` is less than `x[3]`, or `counter` is set to `x[3] * 2` if `counter` is greater than or equal to `x[3]`***.
