Postcondition: ***`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `x` is a list with more than one element, `i` is `last_index + 1`. If `counter < x[i]`, then `counter` is set to the value of `x[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` is `x[last_index + 1]` and `last_index` is unchanged.***
