Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `counter` is the final value of `counter` after processing all test cases, `x` is a list of integers, and `i` is `len(x)` for each test case. If the loop does not execute (when the length of `x` is less than 2), `counter` remains the first element of the list `x`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization and Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs `n_tests` times, where `n_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - For each test case (`i` from 0 to `n_tests-1`):
     - `n` is an integer read from the input.
     - `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
     - `counter` starts with the first element of `x` (`x[0]`).

2. **Inner Loop Processing**:
   - The inner loop processes elements of `x` starting from index 1 to `len(x)-1`.
   - Depending on the value of `x[i]` and the current value of `counter`, `counter` is updated:
     - If `x[i] == 1`, `counter` increases by 1.
     - If `counter > x[i]`, `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`.
     - If `counter < x[i]`, `counter` is set to `x[i]`.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, `counter` is set to `x[i] * 2`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the final value of `counter` is printed for each test case.
   - If the length of `x` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `counter` remains `x[0]`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `counter` contains the final value for each test case, and `x` retains its input values.
