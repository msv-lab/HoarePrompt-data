Postcondition: ***`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `last_index` is 0, `x` remains the same list of integers obtained from the input string. If `counter` is less than `x[3]`, then `counter` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `counter` is set to `x[3] * 2`***
