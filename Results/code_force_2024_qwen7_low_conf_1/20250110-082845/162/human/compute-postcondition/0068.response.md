Postcondition: ***`last_index` is updated to `last_index + 1` and `i` is updated to either `last_index + 2` or `last_index + 3` depending on whether `counter` is less than `x[i]`. If `counter < x[i]`, then `counter` is set to `x[last_index + 2]`. Otherwise, `counter` is set to `x[last_index + 3] * 2`.***
