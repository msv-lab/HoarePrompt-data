Postcondition: ***`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `x` is a list with more than one element. If `counter` is less than `x[i]` for some index `i`, then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` is set to twice the value of `x[i]` for some index `i` where `0 <= i < len(x)`.* ***
