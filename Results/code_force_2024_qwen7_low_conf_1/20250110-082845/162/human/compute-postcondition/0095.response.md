`counter` is assigned the value of `x[i] * 2`. Given that `i` is 3, `counter` will be assigned the value of `x[3] * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `counter` is `x[3] * 2`, `i` is 3, `last_index` is 0, `x` remains the same list of integers obtained from the input string**
