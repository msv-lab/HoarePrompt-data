Step-by-step analysis:
1. Initial State: `i` is 3, `counter` remains unchanged or is increased by 1 if `x[2] == 1`, or is set to `x[2] * ceil(counter / x[2])` if `counter > x[2]`.
2. Code: `counter = x[i] * 2`
   - Since `i` is 3, the code effectively sets `counter = x[3] * 2`.

Since `x[3]` is not defined in the initial state and no default value is provided, let's denote it as `x[3] = k` (where `k` is some unspecified value).

After executing the code, the new value of `counter` is `k * 2`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `counter` is `x[3] * 2`**
