Postcondition: ***`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and the length of `x` is at least 2. If `counter > x[2]`, then `counter` is set to `x[2] * ceil(counter / x[2])`. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.***
