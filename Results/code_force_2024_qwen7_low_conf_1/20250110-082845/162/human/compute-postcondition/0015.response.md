The value of `counter` is updated to be twice the value of `x[i]`. Since `i` is initially set to 1, the previous value of `counter` was `x[1]`, so now `counter` is `2 * x[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `counter` is 2 * `x[1]`, `i` is 1, the length of `x` must be at least 2, and `counter` is less than or equal to `x[i]`**
