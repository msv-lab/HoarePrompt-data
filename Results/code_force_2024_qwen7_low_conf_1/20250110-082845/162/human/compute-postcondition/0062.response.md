Postcondition: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `x` is a list with more than one element, `i` is `last_index + 1`. If `x[i] == 1`, then `counter` is set to `x[0] + 1`. Otherwise, if `counter > x[i]`, `counter` is adjusted to the nearest multiple of `x[i]`; if `counter < x[i]`, `counter` is set to the value of `x[i]`; otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.**
