Postcondition: ***`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1, the length of `x` must be at least 2. If `counter` is less than `x[i]`, then `counter` remains as `x[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` is set to `2 * x[1]` and both `n_tests` and `n` retain their original values.***
