The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. The previous state of `counter` was derived from the adjustment of `last_index` and `i`. Specifically, `i` was `last_index + 2` and `last_index` was `last_index + 1` for the next iteration.

After executing `counter += 1`, the value of `counter` is incremented by 1, but the values of `last_index` and `i` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `last_index` and `i` remain the same as they were before the increment of `counter`.

Output State: **`counter` is incremented by 1, `last_index` is `last_index + 1`, `i` is `last_index + 2`.**
