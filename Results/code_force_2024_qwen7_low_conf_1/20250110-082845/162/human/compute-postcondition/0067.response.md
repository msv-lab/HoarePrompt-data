The code snippet given is:

```python
counter = x[i] * 2
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `last_index = (last_index + 2) - 1 = last_index + 1`
   - `i = last_index + 2`
   - `counter = x[i] * 2`

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code sets `counter` to twice the value of `x[i]`.
   - The value of `last_index` and `i` are derived from each other as described in the initial state.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - Since `i = last_index + 2`, and `last_index` was updated to `last_index + 1` before this line of code, the current value of `i` is effectively `last_index + 1 + 2 = last_index + 3`.
   - Therefore, `counter = x[last_index + 3] * 2`.

The output state after running the code snippet will be:

Output State: **`last_index` is `last_index + 1`, `i` is `last_index + 3`, and `counter` is `x[last_index + 3] * 2`.**
