`counter` is updated to the value of `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`. Given that `counter` is initially greater than `x[i]` for some index `i`, the value of `ceil(counter / x[i])` will be an integer greater than 1 because `counter` divided by `x[i]` results in a value greater than 1. Multiplying this integer by `x[i]` will yield a new value for `counter` that is still greater than `x[i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `x` must have more than one element, and there exists at least one index `i` such that `x[i]` is not equal to 1.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `x` must have more than one element, `counter` is equal to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`, and there exists at least one index `i` such that `x[i]` is not equal to 1.**
