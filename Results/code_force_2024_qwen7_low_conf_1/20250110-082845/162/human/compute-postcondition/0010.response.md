`counter` is updated to the value of `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`. Given that `x[i]` is not equal to 1, and the current value of `counter` is greater than the current value of `x[i]`, let's denote the current value of `counter` as `C` and the value of `x[i]` as `X`. Since `C > X` and `X != 1`, the expression `ceil(C / X)` will be an integer greater than or equal to `X`. Thus, `counter` will be updated to `X * ceil(C / X)`, which is simply `C` because `ceil(C / X)` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `C / X`, making the product `X * ceil(C / X) = C`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with the first element being `counter`, `i` is 1, the length of `x` is at least 2, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1; `counter` is updated to its original value `C` (where `C > X` and `X = x[i]`).**
