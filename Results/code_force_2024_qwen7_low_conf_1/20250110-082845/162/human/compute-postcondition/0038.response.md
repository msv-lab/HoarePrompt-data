`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will now hold the integer value entered by the user. The value of `n_tests` remains unchanged, and the value of `x` and `i` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is the integer value entered by the user, `x` is a list of integers, and `i` is `n_tests`.**
