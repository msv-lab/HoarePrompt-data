The code `counter = x[i] * 2` assigns the value of `x[i] * 2` to the variable `counter`. Given that `i` is 4, `counter` will be set to `x[4] * 2`. The initial state also mentions that `last_index` is 0 and `x` is a list of integers obtained from an input string, but these variables are not directly affected by the given code. Thus, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `last_index` is 0, `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is `x[4] * 2`**
