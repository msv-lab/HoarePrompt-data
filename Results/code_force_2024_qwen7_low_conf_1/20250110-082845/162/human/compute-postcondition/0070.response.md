Postcondition: ***`counter`, `i`, and `last_index` are adjusted based on the value of `x[i]`:
- If `x[i] == 1`, `counter` is incremented by 1, `last_index` is updated to `last_index + 1`, and `i` is updated to `last_index + 2`.
- If `x[i] > 1` and `counter > x[i]`, `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`, `i` is updated to `last_index + 2`, and `last_index` is updated to `last_index + 1`.
- If `x[i] > 1` and `counter <= x[i]`, `last_index` is updated to `last_index + 1`. `i` is updated to either `last_index + 2` or `last_index + 3` depending on whether `counter` is less than `x[i]`. If `counter < x[i]`, `counter` is set to `x[last_index + 2]`. Otherwise, `counter` is set to `x[last_index + 3] * 2`.***
