Postcondition: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `x` is a list with more than one element, and `counter` is either `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])` (if `counter > x[i]` for some index `i`) or `1` (if `counter < x[i]` for some index `i`) or `2 * x[i]` (if `counter` is less than `x[i]` for some index `i`)**
