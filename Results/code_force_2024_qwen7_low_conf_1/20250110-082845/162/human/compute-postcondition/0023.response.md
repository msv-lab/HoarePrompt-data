`counter` is assigned the value of `x[i] * 2`. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `counter` is `x[2] * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `counter` is `x[2] * 2`**.
