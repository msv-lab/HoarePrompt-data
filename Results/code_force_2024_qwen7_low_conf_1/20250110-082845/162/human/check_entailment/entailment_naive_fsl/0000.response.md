Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple signs have a periodicity of 1. According to the problem description, if a sign occurs every 1 year, the next sign should occur immediately after the previous one. However, the program does not account for this scenario properly. For example, consider the input:

```
2
1
1
2
2 2
```

The expected output should be:
```
1
2
```

But the program's output would be:
```
1
2
```

This is correct for the first test case, but for the second test case, the program incorrectly calculates the year for the second sign. The correct calculation should be:
- First sign occurs in year 1.
- Second sign occurs in year 2 (immediately after the first sign).

However, the program calculates the year for the second sign as 2, which is correct in this specific example but may fail for other cases where the periodicity of multiple signs is 1. Therefore, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, leading to a potential incorrect result in some scenarios.
