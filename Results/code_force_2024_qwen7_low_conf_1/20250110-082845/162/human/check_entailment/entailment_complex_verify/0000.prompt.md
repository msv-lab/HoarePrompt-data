You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n_tests` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `counter` is the final value of `counter` after processing all test cases, `x` is a list of integers, and `i` is `len(x)` for each test case. If the loop does not execute (when the length of `x` is less than 2), `counter` remains the first element of the list `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a list of integers. For each test case, it initializes a counter with the first element of the list. It then iterates through the rest of the elements in the list, updating the counter based on specific conditions:
1. If the current element is 1, the counter is incremented by 1.
2. If the current element is greater than the counter, the counter is updated to the current element multiplied by the ceiling of the counter divided by the current element.
3. If the current element is equal to the counter, the counter is doubled.
4. If the current element is less than the counter, the counter is updated to the current element.
After processing all elements in the list for each test case, the function prints the final value of the counter. The function accepts an integer `n_tests` representing the number of test cases and for each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list, followed by a list of integers `a_i`. The function does not return anything but prints the final counter value for each test case. Edge cases include when the length of the list is less than 2, in which case the counter remains the first element of the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple signs have a periodicity of 1. According to the problem description, if a sign occurs every 1 year, the next sign should occur immediately after the previous one. However, the program does not account for this scenario properly. For example, consider the input:

```
2
1
1
2
2 2
```

The expected output should be:
```
1
2
```

But the program's output would be:
```
1
2
```

This is correct for the first test case, but for the second test case, the program incorrectly calculates the year for the second sign. The correct calculation should be:
- First sign occurs in year 1.
- Second sign occurs in year 2 (immediately after the first sign).

However, the program calculates the year for the second sign as 2, which is correct in this specific example but may fail for other cases where the periodicity of multiple signs is 1. Therefore, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, leading to a potential incorrect result in some scenarios.
