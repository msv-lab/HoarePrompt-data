You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
from math import ceil

def func():
    n_tests = int(input())
    for i in range(n_tests):
        n = int(input())
        x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        counter = x[0]
        for i in range(1, len(x)):
            if x[i] == 1:
                counter += 1
            elif counter > x[i]:
                counter = x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])
            elif counter < x[i]:
                counter = x[i]
            else:
                counter = x[i] * 2
        print(counter)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a list of integers. For each test case, it initializes a counter with the first element of the list. It then iterates through the rest of the elements in the list, updating the counter based on specific conditions:
1. If the current element is 1, the counter is incremented by 1.
2. If the current element is greater than the counter, the counter is updated to the current element multiplied by the ceiling of the counter divided by the current element.
3. If the current element is equal to the counter, the counter is doubled.
4. If the current element is less than the counter, the counter is updated to the current element.
After processing all elements in the list for each test case, the function prints the final value of the counter. The function accepts an integer `n_tests` representing the number of test cases and for each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list, followed by a list of integers `a_i`. The function does not return anything but prints the final counter value for each test case. Edge cases include when the length of the list is less than 2, in which case the counter remains the first element of the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The program aims to find the year when all \(n\) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, where each sign occurs every \(a_i\) years. After one sign occurs in some year \(x\), the tribe starts waiting for the next sign starting from \(x+1\).
2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The code initializes the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs \(n\) and their periodicities \(x = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]\).
   - It sets `counter` to the first periodicity \(x[0]\).
   - For each subsequent periodicity \(a_i\) (for \(i = 1\) to \(n-1\)), the code checks:
     - If \(a_i = 1\), it increments the `counter` by 1 (since any year can be the start).
     - If \(counter > a_i\), it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) using `ceil(counter / a_i) * a_i`, ensuring the `counter` aligns with \(a_i\).
     - If \(counter < a_i\), it updates `counter` to \(a_i\) (as the next sign would start occurring at the earliest from \(a_i\)).
     - Otherwise, it simply doubles `counter` (though this seems unnecessary based on the problem's requirements).
   - Finally, it prints the `counter` value, which should be the year when all signs occur sequentially.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles the case where a periodicity is 1 (signs can occur in any year).
   - It correctly handles the LCM calculation for other periodicities.
   - The logic seems to be consistent with the problem statement for the given examples.

4. **Validation**:
   - The provided examples in the problem description match the expected behavior of the code.
   - The solution appears to handle all given test cases correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program logic seems to be consistent with the problem description and examples provided.
