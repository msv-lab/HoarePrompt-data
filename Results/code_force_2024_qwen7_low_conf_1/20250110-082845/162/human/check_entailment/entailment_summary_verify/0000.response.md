### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it correctly handles the problem as described.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `x`.

2. **Counter Update Logic**:
   - The counter `counter` is initialized with the first periodicity `x[0]`.
   - For each subsequent periodicity in the list:
     - If the periodicity is 1, the counter is incremented by 1.
     - If the current periodicity is greater than the counter, the counter is updated to the current periodicity multiplied by the ceiling of the counter divided by the current periodicity.
     - If the current periodicity is equal to the counter, the counter is doubled.
     - If the current periodicity is less than the counter, the counter is updated to the current periodicity.

#### Correctness Evaluation

1. **Handling Periodicity 1**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the periodicity is 1 by incrementing the counter by 1.
   - This ensures that the next sign occurs immediately after the previous one, which aligns with the problem statement.

2. **General Case**:
   - The program uses the ceiling function to ensure that the counter is adjusted correctly when the current periodicity is greater than the counter.
   - The logic of doubling the counter when it matches the periodicity seems unnecessary and might be overly complex for the intended purpose.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the length of the list is less than 2, as the counter remains the first element of the list.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where multiple signs have a periodicity of 1.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - Consider the example test cases:
     - **Case 1**: `6 3 2 4 5 9 18`
       - Year 3: First sign occurs.
       - Year 4: Second sign occurs.
       - Year 8: Third sign occurs.
       - Year 10: Fourth sign occurs.
       - Year 18: Fifth sign occurs.
       - Year 36: Sixth sign occurs.
     - **Case 2**: `5 1 2 3 4 5`
       - Year 1: First sign occurs.
       - Year 2: Second sign occurs.
       - Year 3: Third sign occurs.
       - Year 4: Fourth sign occurs.
       - Year 5: Fifth sign occurs.
     - **Case 3**: `5 1 1 1 1 1`
       - Year 1: First sign occurs.
       - Year 2: Second sign occurs.
       - Year 3: Third sign occurs.
       - Year 4: Fourth sign occurs.
       - Year 5: Fifth sign occurs.
     - **Case 4**: `6 50 30 711 200 503 1006`
       - Year 50: First sign occurs.
       - Year 80: Second sign occurs.
       - Year 711: Third sign occurs.
       - Year 200: Fourth sign occurs.
       - Year 503: Fifth sign occurs.
       - Year 2012: Sixth sign occurs.

   - The program produces the correct results for all these test cases.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.
