Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any two cells is maximized.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(n)`**: This function generates coordinates for placing \( n \) points in an \( n \times n \) grid. It ensures that the points are spread out enough to potentially achieve a large set of unique Manhattan distances.
   - **Function `func_2()`**: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads input, processes each test case using `func_1()`, and prints the resulting points. The implementation seems to correctly read the number of test cases and individual \( n \) values, process them using `func_1()`, and print the results.
3. **Verification**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function `func_2()` correctly reads the input and processes each test case independently.
   - **Output Handling**: For each test case, it uses `func_1()` to generate the points and then prints them. Given the examples in the problem statement, the `func_1()` function appears to produce valid and diverse placements of points, which helps in maximizing the set of unique Manhattan distances.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases appropriately, such as when \( n \) is 2 or larger up to \( 10^3 \).

Given that both functions (`func_1()` and `func_2()`) seem to correctly implement the logic to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for each test case, and the provided examples validate the correctness of the approach, the program meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
