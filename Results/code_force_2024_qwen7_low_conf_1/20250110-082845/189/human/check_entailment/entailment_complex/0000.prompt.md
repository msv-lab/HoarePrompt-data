You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
def func_1(n):
    points = []
    for i in range(n):
        x = i + 1
        
        y = i * 2 % n + 1
        
        points.append((x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `points` is a list containing tuples (x, y) where x ranges from 2 to n+1 and y ranges from 3 to 2n+1, `i` is n, `x` is n+1, `y` is 2*n+1 % n + 1.
    return points
    #`points` is a list containing tuples (x, y) where x ranges from 2 to n+1 and y ranges from 3 to 2n+1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 2 to 10^3. It initializes an empty list `points` and iterates over a range from 0 to `n-1`. During each iteration, it calculates `x` as `i + 1` and `y` as `(i * 2) % n + 1`, ensuring that `y` is within the specified range. These values are then appended as a tuple `(x, y)` to the `points` list. After completing the loop, the function returns the `points` list, which contains tuples `(x, y)` where `x` ranges from 2 to `n+1` and `y` ranges from 3 to `2n+1`. This process covers all integers `n` in the specified range, including the edge case when `n` is exactly 10^3.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(data[i + 1])
        
        result = func_1(n)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[t]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(int(data[2]))`, ..., `func_1(int(data[t]))`, `i` is `t-1`, `result` is `func_1(int(data[t]))`
    for result in results:
        for x, y in result:
            print(x, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes a series of test cases, and prints the results. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n`, each representing the size of the input for the `func_1` function. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n)` and stores the result in a list `results`. Finally, it iterates over the `results` list and prints each pair of values.
