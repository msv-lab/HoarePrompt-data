Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for a given \( n \times n \) grid. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not always produce the optimal configuration. For example, when \( n = 3 \), the function generates the points \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\), but the optimal configuration would be \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) as described in the problem statement. This discrepancy shows that the function does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
