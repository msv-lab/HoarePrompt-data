Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed explanation of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read`, which reads all the input at once and splits it into parts. This is consistent with the problem statement, where multiple test cases are provided.
   - It processes the input to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the values of `n` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates `n` points in the grid such that the Manhattan distances between these points are maximized.
   - The formula used to generate the points `(x, y)` ensures that the Manhattan distances are spread out across the grid. Specifically, `x = i + 1` and `y = i * 2 % n + 1` generate coordinates that cover the grid while ensuring a diverse set of distances.
   - The generated points are returned as a list of tuples, which matches the expected output format.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate value of `n`.
   - It collects the results of `func_1` for each test case and prints the points for each test case.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the coordinates of the points for each test case without any additional formatting or unnecessary output. This matches the problem statement requirement to output the points directly.

Given that the program handles the input correctly, generates the required points for each test case, and prints them in the specified format, it follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
