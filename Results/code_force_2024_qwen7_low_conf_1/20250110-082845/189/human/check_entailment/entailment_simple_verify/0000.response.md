### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's go through the functions and the logic step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function 1 Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    points = []
    for i in range(n):
        x = i + 1
        y = i * 2 % n + 1
        points.append((x, y))
    return points
```

- **Initial State**: \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \).
- **Logic**:
  - The variable `x` is set to \( i + 1 \), ranging from 1 to \( n \).
  - The variable `y` is calculated as \( i \cdot 2 \% n + 1 \). This means:
    - For \( i = 0 \), \( y = 1 \)
    - For \( i = 1 \), \( y = 3 \)
    - For \( i = 2 \), \( y = 5 \) if \( n > 5 \), otherwise \( y = 1 \)
    - For \( i = 3 \), \( y = 7 \) if \( n > 7 \), otherwise \( y = 3 \)
  - The points generated are \((1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 5), \ldots\)

This function does not generate points in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances. As mentioned in the original assessment, for \( n = 3 \), the function generates \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\), which is suboptimal. The optimal configuration should be \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\).

#### Function 2 Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(data[i + 1])
        result = func_1(n)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        for x, y in result:
            print(x, y)
```

- **Initial State**: \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \), and for each test case, \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \).
- **Logic**:
  - The input is read and split into a list of strings.
  - For each test case, `func_1(n)` is called, and the result is appended to `results`.
  - Finally, for each point in each result, it prints the coordinates.

The function `func_2` correctly processes the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, but since `func_1` does not generate the optimal points, the overall output will not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not always produce the optimal configuration of points, leading to a suboptimal number of distinct Manhattan distances. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
