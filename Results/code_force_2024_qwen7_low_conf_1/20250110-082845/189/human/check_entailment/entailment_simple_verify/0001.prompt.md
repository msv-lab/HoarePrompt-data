You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that both `func_1` and `func_2` meet the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to generate `n` points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - For each point `(x, y)` generated in the loop, `x` is set to `i + 1`, and `y` is set to `i * 2 % n + 1`. This means `y` cycles through a pattern based on `n`.
   - Given the nature of the Manhattan distance, different values of `x` and `y` will generally yield distinct distances, especially when they are spread out across the grid.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and applies `func_1` to generate the required points for each test case.
   - It then prints the points for each test case as required.

Given the examples provided in the problem statement, we can see that the solutions suggested involve placing points in a manner that maximizes the distinct Manhattan distances. The function `func_1` generates such points for each test case, and `func_2` correctly processes and prints these points.

Let's verify this with some examples:

- For \( n = 2 \):
  - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\)
  - Distances: \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Set of distinct distances: \(\{0, 1\}\)

- For \( n = 3 \):
  - Points: \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\)
  - Distances: \(|2-2| + |1-1| = 0\), \(|2-2| + |3-3| = 0\), \(|3-3| + |1-1| = 0\), \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\), \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\), \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)
  - Set of distinct distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)

These examples align with the expected output, confirming that `func_1` generates the required points.

Therefore, the provided program correctly implements the logic to generate points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for each test case.
