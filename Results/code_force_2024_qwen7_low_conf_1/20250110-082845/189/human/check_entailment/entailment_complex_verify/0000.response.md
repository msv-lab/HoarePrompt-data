Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Function 1: `func_1(n)`
- **Purpose**: Generates a list of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\).
- **Logic**:
  - The function iterates over a range from 0 to `n-1`.
  - For each index `i`, it calculates `x` as `i + 1`.
  - It calculates `y` as `(i * 2) % n + 1`, which ensures that `y` is within the range `[1, n]`.
  - The points generated are stored in the `points` list.
  
- **Behavior**:
  - The `x` values range from 1 to `n`.
  - The `y` values range from 3 to `2n + 1` due to the modulo operation and addition.
  - The specific pattern of generating points is not aligned with maximizing the distinct Manhattan distances.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Purpose**: Reads input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
  - Extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case `n`.
  - Calls `func_1(n)` for each test case and stores the results.
  - Iterates over the results and prints each point.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State Analysis**:
  - Before calling `func_1(n)`: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^3`.
  - After calling `func_1(n)`: `points` contains tuples `(x, y)` where `x` ranges from 2 to `n+1` and `y` ranges from 3 to `2n+1`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Example for n = 3**:
  - `func_1(3)` generates points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 3)\).
  - The Manhattan distances are: \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \), \( |1-2| + |1-2| = 2 \), \( |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \).
  - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 2, 4\}\), which has a size of 3.
  - Optimal configuration: \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\) results in distances \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 3.
  - The function does not always generate the optimal configuration.

- **Example for n = 4**:
  - `func_1(4)` generates points: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\).
  - The Manhattan distances are: \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \), \( |1-2| + |1-2| = 2 \), \( |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \), \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \).
  - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 2, 4, 6\}\), which has a size of 4.
  - Optimal configuration: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), \((4, 4)\) results in distances \(\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 5.
  - The function does not always generate the optimal configuration.

Given these examples and the analysis, the function `func_1(n)` does not always produce the optimal configuration, and thus the overall correctness of the program is false.

Final: **False**
