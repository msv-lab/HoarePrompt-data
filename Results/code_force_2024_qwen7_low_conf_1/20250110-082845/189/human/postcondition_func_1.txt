The function reads input from standard input, processes a series of test cases, and prints the results. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n`, each representing the size of the input for the `func_1` function. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n)` and stores the result in a list `results`. Finally, it iterates over the `results` list and prints each pair of values.
