The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since the initial state specifies that `x` is the first element of the first pair in `results` and `y` is the second element of the first pair in `results`, the print statement will output these values. However, the actual values of `x` and `y` are not modified by this code; they are only printed. The other variables (`t`, `results`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a non-empty list of pairs, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of the first pair in `results`, `y` is the second element of the first pair in `results`, and the output of the print statement is `x y`**
