According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over each pair in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of pairs, `i` is -1, and `result` is `None None`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `results` must contain at least one pair (i.e., it is not empty).
2. Since `i` is -1, the first pair in the `results` list should be assigned to `result`.
3. After assigning the first pair to `result`, `i` will be updated to 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `t` remains at least 1.
- `results` must be a non-empty list of pairs.
- `i` will be updated to 0.
- `result` will be the first pair in the `results` list.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a non-empty list of pairs, `i` is 0, `result` is the first pair in the `results` list**
