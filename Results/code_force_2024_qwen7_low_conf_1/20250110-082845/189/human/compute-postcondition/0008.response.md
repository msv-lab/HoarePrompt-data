According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `func_1(int(data[1]))`, and `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. Since `i` starts at 0, it needs to become 1 for the loop to continue.

Let's update the states accordingly:

- `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `data` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `results` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` changes from 0 to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `i` is 1**
