The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. To determine the new state, we need to know the value of `result`. Since `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n)`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, we can represent `result` as `func_1(int(data[1]))`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n)`.

After executing the code `results.append(result)`, the value of `results` will be updated to include the value of `result`. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `i` is 0**.
