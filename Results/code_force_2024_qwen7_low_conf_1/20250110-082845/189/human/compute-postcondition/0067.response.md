The code `print(f'1 {i}')` attempts to print a formatted string, but there is no variable `i` defined in the initial state or within the given code snippet. Since `i` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError`. However, following the instruction to provide the output state and considering the initial state, we can infer that the code did not execute successfully due to the missing variable.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, variable `i` is undefined and the code raises a NameError.**
