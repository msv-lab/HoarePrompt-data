The code `n = int(data[i + 1])` affects the value of `n`. According to the initial state, `i` is 1, so `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[1 + 1]`, which is `data[2]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`.
- `results` is a list containing one element which is `func_1(int(data[1]))`.
- `i` is 1.

After executing the code, `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `i` is 1**
