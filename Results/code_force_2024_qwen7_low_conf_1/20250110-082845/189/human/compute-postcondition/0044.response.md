According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, it will become 2 for the next iteration. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1, but it does not change based on the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
