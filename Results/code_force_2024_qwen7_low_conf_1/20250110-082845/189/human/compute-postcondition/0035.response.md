The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. However, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged by this operation. The states of the other variables (`result` and `index`) are not affected.

Output State: **`result` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, x is the first element of the first tuple in `result`, y is the second element of the first tuple in `result`, index is 0**
