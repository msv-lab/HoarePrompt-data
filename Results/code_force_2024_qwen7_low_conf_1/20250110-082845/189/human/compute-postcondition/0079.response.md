Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n_` is an input integer, `i` is `n_ - 1`, and the printed output consists of the specified patterns for different values of `n`.** 

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n_` is an input integer.

2. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for `n_` times.
   - Inside the loop, `n` is taken as an input, and based on the value of `n`, different outputs are printed.

3. **Pattern of Outputs:**
   - For `n = 2`: Prints '1 1' and '1 2'.
   - For `n = 3`: No specific additional prints other than those for `n = 2`.
   - For `n = 4`: Prints '1 1', '1 3', '4 3', and '4 4'.
   - For `n >= 5`: Prints '1 i' for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, followed by `n n` and `n 2`.

4. **Final Values After Loop Execution:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `n_` remains unchanged as it is the initial input.
   - `i` is set to `n_ - 1` after the loop completes because the loop iterates `n_` times, and `i` starts from 0 and is incremented each time the loop runs.

5. **Summary:**
   - The final state after the loop has executed `n_` times will have `t` and `n_` remaining unchanged, and `i` will be `n_ - 1`.
   - The printed output will follow the pattern specified for the values of `n` encountered during the loop iterations.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n_` is an input integer, `i` is `n_ - 1`, and the printed output consists of the specified patterns for different values of `n`.**
