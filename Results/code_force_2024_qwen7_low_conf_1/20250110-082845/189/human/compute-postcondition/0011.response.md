The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is `func_1(n)`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`.
- `results` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `func_1(int(data[1]))` and the second element is `func_1(n)`.
- `i` is 1.
- `result` is `func_1(n)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `func_1(int(data[1]))` and `func_1(n)`, `i` is 1, `result` is `func_1(n)`**.
