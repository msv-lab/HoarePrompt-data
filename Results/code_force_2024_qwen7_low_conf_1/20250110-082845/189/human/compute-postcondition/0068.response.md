According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop starts with `i = 1` and ends when `i` reaches `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was undefined, and the code raised a `NameError`. This indicates that `i` was not defined or did not complete an iteration properly.

Given that the loop started with `i = 1` and would increment `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2 (the first iteration) and `n` must be greater than 3 (since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` must be 2.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 2**
