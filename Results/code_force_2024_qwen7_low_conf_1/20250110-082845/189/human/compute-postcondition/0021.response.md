The code `print(x, y)` does not affect the values of any variables; it only prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are not defined in the given code snippet, they will be printed as their default values (which are undefined in this context). However, based on the initial state, we know that `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of pairs with at least one pair, `i` is 0, and `result` is the first pair in the `results` list.

Since `x` and `y` are not defined, the print statement will simply output `None None` (assuming the absence of defined values results in `None`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of pairs with at least one pair, `i` is 0, `result` is the first pair in the `results` list, print statement outputs `None None`**
