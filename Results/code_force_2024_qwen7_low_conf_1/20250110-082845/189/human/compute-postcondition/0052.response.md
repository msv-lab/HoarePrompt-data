Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\); `n` is an input integer; `i` is the number of iterations + 1. If `n` equals 3, then `i` is 1. If `n` equals 4, `i` remains 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` is printed twice, separated by a space in the console output.***
