Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input, processes a series of test cases, and prints the results. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n`, each representing the size of the input for the `func_1` function. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n)` and stores the result in a list `results`. Finally, it iterates over the `results` list and prints each pair of values.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `t` is 0, the function will not execute the loop and will directly exit without processing any test cases.
- The function assumes that the input for each test case is valid (i.e., `1 <= t <= 50` and `2 <= n <= 10^3`). If these conditions are not met, the function will still process the input but may lead to incorrect behavior.
- The function does not handle cases where the input format is invalid or incomplete. For example, if the input does not contain enough elements or is not properly formatted, the function may raise an exception or produce unexpected results.
- The function does not provide any error handling for `func_1(n)`. If `func_1` fails for any reason, the function will simply skip that test case and proceed to the next one.
