The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the list `data` is created with the split result, and the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`.**
