Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[t]`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`.
- `results` is a list containing `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(int(data[2]))`, ..., `func_1(int(data[t]))`.
- `i` is `t - 1`.
- `result` is `func_1(int(data[t]))`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for result in results:
    for x, y in result:
        print(x, y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is at least 1.
   - `results` is a non-empty list of pairs.
   - `i` is the length of `results`.
   - `result` is `None None` (if no elements in `results`).

2. **First Iteration:**
   - `result` is the first element in `results`.
   - For each pair `(x, y)` in `result`, print `x` and `y`.

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - `result` is the second element in `results`.
   - For each pair `(x, y)` in `result`, print `x` and `y`.

4. **General Iteration:**
   - `result` is the `j`-th element in `results` where `j` ranges from 0 to `len(results) - 1`.
   - For each pair `(x, y)` in `result`, print `x` and `y`.

5. **Final State:**
   - After all iterations, `result` will be `None` if `results` is empty.
   - If `results` is not empty, `result` will be the last element in `results`.
   - `x` and `y` will be the first and second elements of the last pair in `results`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged and is at least 1.
- `results` is a list of pairs.
- `i` is the length of `results`.
- `result` is the last element in `results`, which is a pair `(x, y)`.
- `x` and `y` are the first and second elements of the last pair in `results`, respectively.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, the final state of the variables will be:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a non-empty list of pairs.
- `i` is the length of `results`.
- `result` is the last element in `results`, which is a pair `(x, y)`.
- `x` and `y` are the first and second elements of the last pair in `results`, respectively.

**Output State:** **t is at least 1, results is a non-empty list of pairs, i is the length of results, result is the last element in results, which is a pair (x, y), x is the first element of the last pair in results, and y is the second element of the last pair in results.**
