To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop and their initial values before the loop starts.

1. **Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - `result`: This variable is used to iterate over the elements in the `results` list.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `t`: The integer value of the first element in `data`.
   - `n`: The integer value of `data[t]`.
   - `data`: A list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`.
   - `results`: A list containing `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(int(data[2]))`, ..., `func_1(int(data[t]))`.
   - `i`: Initially set to `t-1`.
   - `result`: Initially set to `func_1(int(data[t]))`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will iterate as long as there are elements in the `results` list. Therefore, the loop can only execute if `results` is not empty.

4. **Initial State for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. Since `results` contains `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(int(data[2]))`, ..., `func_1(int(data[t]))`, and `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, it implies that `results` will always have at least `t` elements (assuming `t > 0`).

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure that `t` is at least 1, so that `results` has at least one element.
   - `i` is set to `t-1`, but this is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `result` is set to `func_1(int(data[t]))`, but this is just the initial value of the first iteration and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Given these considerations, the critical state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is ensuring that `t` is at least 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `results` is a list containing `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(int(data[2]))`, ..., `func_1(int(data[t]))`, `i` is `t-1`, `result` is `func_1(int(data[t]))`**
