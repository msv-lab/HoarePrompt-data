Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`.
   - `results` is a list containing two elements which are `func_1(int(data[1]))` and `func_1(n)`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `result` is `func_1(n)`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, we need to check if `i < t` for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `t`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the condition `i < t` will be true if `t` is greater than 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2.
   - The variable `i` is set to `i + 1` at each iteration, so it will become 2 in the next iteration.
   - The variable `result` will be updated to the value of `func_1(n)` in the next iteration.

5. **Maintaining Other Variables:**
   - `t` remains the same as it is derived from the input and does not change within the loop.
   - `n`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

**Final Adjusted States:**

- `i` is 2 (since it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration).
- `result` will be `func_1(n)` (or potentially updated within the loop body).

Given the above analysis, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `func_1(int(data[1]))` and `func_1(n)`, `i` is 2, `result` is `func_1(n)`**.
