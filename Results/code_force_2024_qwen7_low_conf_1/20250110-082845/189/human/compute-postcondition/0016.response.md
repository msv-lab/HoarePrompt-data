Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[t]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(int(data[2]))`, ..., `func_1(int(data[t]))`, `i` is `t-1`, `result` is `func_1(int(data[t]))`**.

### Explanation:
- **`t`:** This remains the integer value of the first element in `data` because `t` is set initially and is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`:** After the loop completes, `i` will be `t-1`. Therefore, `n` will be the integer value of `data[t]`.
- **`data`:** This remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`.
- **`results`:** The `results` list will contain the function outputs for each iteration. Specifically, it will contain `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(int(data[2]))`, ..., up to `func_1(int(data[t]))`.
- **`i`:** Since the loop runs `t` times and `i` starts from 0, after the last iteration, `i` will be `t-1`.
- **`result`:** The last computed value of `result` will be `func_1(int(data[t]))`.

### Special Case (if the loop does not execute):
- If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute. In this case:
  - `t` is 0.
  - `n` is undefined or irrelevant.
  - `data` is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
  - `results` is an empty list since no iterations were performed.
  - `i` is 0 (initial value).
  - `result` is undefined.

However, based on the problem statement, we assume that `t` is always a positive integer, so the special case where `t` is 0 is not considered here.
