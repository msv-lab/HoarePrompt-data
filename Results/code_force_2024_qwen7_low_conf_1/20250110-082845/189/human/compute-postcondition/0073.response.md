The code `print(f'{n} {n}')` prints the value of `n` twice. Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is `n-2`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The print statement does not affect the values of `n` or `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `i` is `n-2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `i` is `n-2`**
