The code assigns the value of `func_1(n)` to the variable `result`. The previous value of `result` was `func_1(n)`, and this value remains unchanged as the assignment simply reassigns the same value to `result`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `results`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `func_1(int(data[1]))` and `func_1(n)`, `i` is 2, `result` is `func_1(n)`**
