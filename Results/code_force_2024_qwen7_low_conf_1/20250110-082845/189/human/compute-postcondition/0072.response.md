Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop runs for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. However, since the loop condition is `range(1, n-1)`, `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
- After the loop completes, `i` will take the value of `n-2`, as the loop iterates from 1 up to `n-2`.

If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute at all, and `i` remains undefined (raising a NameError when printed).
