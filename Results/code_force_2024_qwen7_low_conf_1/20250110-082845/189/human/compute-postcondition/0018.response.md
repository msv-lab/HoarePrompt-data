Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop is iterating over pairs `(x, y)` from the `result` list. For the loop to execute, `result` must contain at least one pair.

2. **Current States**:
   - `t` must be at least 1: This means there is at least one element in the `results` list.
   - `results` is a list containing `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(int(data[2]))`, ..., `func_1(int(data[t]))`.
   - `i` is `t-1`: This means the loop starts with the last element in the `results` list.
   - `result` is `func_1(int(data[t]))`: This is the last element in the `results` list.

3. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop iterates over pairs `(x, y)` from the `result` list, `result` must contain at least one pair. Given that `result` is `func_1(int(data[t]))`, we need to ensure that this value is a pair.
   - The initial state already indicates that `t` must be at least 1, ensuring that `results` has at least one element. However, since the loop iterates over pairs, `result` should be a list of pairs rather than a single value.

4. **Final State**:
   - Ensure `t` is at least 1.
   - Ensure `results` is a list of pairs, not a single value.
   - `i` should be `t-1`, indicating the loop starts with the last element.
   - `result` should be the last element in the `results` list, which should be a pair.

Therefore, the required state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of pairs, `i` is `t-1`, `result` is the last pair in the `results` list**
