According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over pairs in `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` and `y` are the elements of the second pair in `results`.

To determine the state needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. The loop will move to the next pair in `results`.
2. Therefore, `x` and `y` will now be the elements of the third pair in `results`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should reflect these changes.

State: **`x` and `y` are the elements of the third pair in `results`**
