The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `result` is `func_1(n)`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `results` will have three elements: `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(n)`, and `func_1(n)`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(n)`, and `func_1(n)`, `i` is 2, `result` is `func_1(n)`**
