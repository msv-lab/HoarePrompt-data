The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and the parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. 

Case_1: If `t` is within the range [1, 50] and `n` is within the range [2, 10^3], the function returns a specific value based on the relationship between `t` and `n`.
Case_2: If `t` is not within the range [1, 50], the function returns an error message indicating that `t` is out of the valid range.
Case_3: If `n` is not within the range [2, 10^3], the function returns an error message indicating that `n` is out of the valid range.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `t` and `n`, validate their ranges, and return a specific value based on the relationship between `t` and `n` if both are within their valid ranges, or return an appropriate error message if either `t` or `n` is out of its valid range.
