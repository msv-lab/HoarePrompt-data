According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 2

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. The variable `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
2. The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true, meaning `n - 1 > 3` or equivalently, `n > 4`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
- `n` must now be greater than 4
- `i` is now 3

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 3**
