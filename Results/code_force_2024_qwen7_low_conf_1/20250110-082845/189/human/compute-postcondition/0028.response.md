Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is at least 1.
   - `results` is a non-empty list of pairs.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is the first element of the first pair in `results`.
   - `y` is the second element of the first pair in `results`.
   - The output of the print statement is `x y`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The for loop iterates over each pair `(x, y)` in `results`.

3. **Current Iteration End:**
   - Since `i` is 0, we are currently looking at the first pair in `results`.
   - `x` and `y` are already set based on the first pair.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented.
   - The value of `i` will increase by 1 from 0 to 1.
   - To proceed to the next pair in `results`, `i` should now be 1.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - The next pair in `results` will be accessed, so `x` will be the first element of the second pair, and `y` will be the second element of the second pair.

6. **Output State:**
   - The output will be `x y`, where `x` and `y` are now the elements of the second pair in `results`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a non-empty list of pairs, `i` is 1, `x` is the first element of the second pair in `results`, `y` is the second element of the second pair in `results`**.
