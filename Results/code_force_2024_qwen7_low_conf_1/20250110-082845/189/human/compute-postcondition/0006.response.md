The code assigns the value returned by `func_1(n)` to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` is not defined, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, we know that `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, and `func_1` takes this integer as an argument.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`
- `results` is an empty list
- `i` is 0

After the code runs, the following changes occur:
- `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n)`

Since the value of `result` depends on the undefined function `func_1`, we cannot specify its exact value. However, we know that `t`, `n`, `data`, `results`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n)`**
