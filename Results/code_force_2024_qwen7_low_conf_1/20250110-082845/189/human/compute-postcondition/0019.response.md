The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. However, the variables `x` and `y` are not defined or assigned any values in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The only action taken is printing `x` and `y`, which does not affect their values or add any new information about them.

The output of the print statement will be `None` since no values are printed for `x` and `y`, but this does not change the state of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of pairs, `i` is `t-1`, `result` is the last pair in the `results` list**
