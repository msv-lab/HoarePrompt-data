The code `print(f'{n} 2')` prints the value of `n` followed by the string ' 2'. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`. The output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the new print statement's effect.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` is greater than the number of iterations of the loop, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, and the value of `n` is printed twice, separated by a space. The console output is: `n 2`.**
