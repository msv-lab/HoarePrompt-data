The code `print(f'{n} {n}')` prints the value of `n` twice, separated by a space, but does not change the values of any variables. The initial state of `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` is greater than the number of iterations of the loop, and `i` is the number of iterations + 1. Since no variables are modified, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` is greater than the number of iterations of the loop, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, and the value of `n` is printed twice, separated by a space.**
