Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is at least 1.
   - `results` is a non-empty list of pairs.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `results`.
   - `x` is the first element of the last pair in `results`.
   - `y` is the second element of the last pair in `results`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each `result` in `results`.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `results` to iterate over.
   - Since `i` is currently equal to the length of `results`, the loop will execute if `i < len(results)`, which means `len(results)` must be greater than `i`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is already equal to the length of `results`, for the loop to execute again, `results` must have one more element.
   - Therefore, the length of `results` will increase by 1.

5. **Updating the State:**
   - `t` remains at least 1.
   - `results` now has one more element, making its length `i + 1`.
   - `i` will be updated to the new length of `results`.
   - `x` and `y` will remain the same as they were for the last pair in the previous iteration, but the next iteration will consider the new last pair in the updated `results`.

**Final Adjusted State:**
- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a non-empty list of pairs with one more element added.
- `i` is equal to the new length of `results`, which is `i + 1`.
- `x` is the first element of the new last pair in `results`.
- `y` is the second element of the new last pair in `results`.

**State:**
**`t` is at least 1, `results` is a non-empty list of pairs with one more element, `i` is equal to the new length of `results` (i + 1), `x` is the first element of the new last pair in `results`, and `y` is the second element of the new last pair in `results`.**
