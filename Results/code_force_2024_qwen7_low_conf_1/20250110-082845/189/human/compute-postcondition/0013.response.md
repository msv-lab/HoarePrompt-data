Step-by-step analysis:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`.
   - `results` is a list containing two elements which are `func_1(int(data[1]))` and `func_1(n)`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `result` is `func_1(n)`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   n = int(data[i + 1])
   ```

3. Since `i` is initially 2, `i + 1` evaluates to 3. So, `n` is reassigned to the integer value of `data[3]`.

4. After this line of code, the updated values are:
   - `t` remains the integer value of the first element in `data`.
   - `n` is now the integer value of `data[3]`.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `results` remains `[func_1(int(data[1])), func_1(n)]`.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `result` is still `func_1(n)`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are `func_1(int(data[1]))` and `func_1(n)`, `i` is 2, `result` is `func_1(n)`**
