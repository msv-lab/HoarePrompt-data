The code `print('1 2')` simply prints the string '1 2' to the console. It does not affect the value of the variable `n`. The initial printed output '1 1' remains unchanged. Therefore, the only difference is the new printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value entered by the user, printed output is '1 1' and '1 2'**
