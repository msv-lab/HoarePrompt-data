According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list and the variable `i`. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one pair. Additionally, the initial value of `i` is set to 0, but the loop will start with the first pair in the `results` list, meaning `x` and `y` will be assigned the values of the first pair.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0, but the loop will start with the first pair in the `results` list, so we don't need to adjust `i`.
2. The `results` list must be a non-empty list of pairs to ensure there is at least one pair to iterate over.
3. The variables `x` and `y` will be the first pair in the `results` list during the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are to ensure that `results` is a non-empty list of pairs.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a non-empty list of pairs, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of the first pair in `results`, `y` is the second element of the first pair in `results`**
