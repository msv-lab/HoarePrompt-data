According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `results` and `i`. The loop iterates over each pair in the `results` list using tuple unpacking. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of pairs with at least one pair, `i` is 0, and `result` is the first pair in the `results` list. The loop body has already processed the first pair, meaning `i` will be incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of the `results` list. Since `i` is currently 0, it needs to be incremented to 1. For the loop to continue, the `results` list must have at least two pairs.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of pairs with at least two pairs, `i` is 1, `result` is the second pair in the `results` list**
