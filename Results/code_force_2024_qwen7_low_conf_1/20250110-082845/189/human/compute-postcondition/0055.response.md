Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `i` is the number of iterations + 1 (if `n` is 2, 3, or 4, `i` remains 1; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` is printed twice)
   - An empty line is printed

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(n_):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs `n_` times.
   - Since `_` is used as the loop variable, it doesn't affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.
   - The loop body itself is not specified, but it doesn't change the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the number of iterations + 1.
   - The loop will run again if `i` is less than or equal to `n_`.
   - If `i` is already equal to `n_`, the loop will not run again.

Given the above points, let's determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time:

- If `i` is currently `n_`, the loop cannot execute again because the loop condition `i <= n_` will fail.
- If `i` is less than `n_`, the loop can execute again, and `i` will be incremented by 1.

Since we need to consider the condition for the loop to execute one more time, we assume `i` is less than `n_`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
- The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

So, the state adjustments needed are:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`**
