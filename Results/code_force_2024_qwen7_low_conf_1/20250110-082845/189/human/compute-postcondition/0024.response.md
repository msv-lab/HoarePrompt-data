Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of pairs, `i` is -1, `result` is `None None`**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (`t >= 1`).
   - `results` is a list containing `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `func_1(int(data[2]))`, ..., `func_1(int(data[t]))`.
   - `i` is `t-1`.
   - `result` is `func_1(int(data[t]))`.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for x, y in result:
       print(x, y)
   ```

3. **First Iteration (i = t-1)**:
   - `result` is the last pair in `results` (since `i` is `t-1`).
   - After printing `x` and `y`, the loop exits.
   - Variables after this iteration: `i` becomes `t-2`.

4. **Second Iteration (i = t-2)**:
   - `result` is now the second-to-last pair in `results`.
   - After printing `x` and `y`, the loop exits.
   - Variables after this iteration: `i` becomes `t-3`.

5. **Third Iteration (i = t-3)**:
   - `result` is now the third-to-last pair in `results`.
   - After printing `x` and `y`, the loop exits.
   - Variables after this iteration: `i` becomes `t-4`.

6. **General Case (i >= 0)**:
   - The loop continues until `i` is no longer non-negative.
   - When `i` becomes -1, the loop condition `i >= 0` fails, and the loop terminates.
   - At this point, `result` will be `None None` because the loop has printed all elements in `results`.

7. **Final State**:
   - `t` remains unchanged (`t >= 1`).
   - `results` remains unchanged (a list of pairs).
   - `i` is -1 (loop condition fails).
   - `result` is `None None` (last printed value).

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state is:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a list of pairs.
- `i` is -1.
- `result` is `None None`.
