The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The constraints provided are for variables within the function, not as input parameters. Given that the function does not take any parameters, the functionality should reflect that.

However, based on the constraints provided, the function likely processes some internal variables `t` and `n` with specific ranges. Since no specific behavior or output is given directly in the problem statement, we can only infer the nature of the parameters from the constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, but it processes two internal variables `t` and `n` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.**
