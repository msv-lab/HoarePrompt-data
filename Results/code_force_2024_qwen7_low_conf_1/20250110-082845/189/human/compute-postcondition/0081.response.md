Functionality: **The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints specific patterns of pairs of integers based on the value of `n`. The function does not return any value but outputs the specified patterns to the standard output. The function also validates that the number of test cases `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 50\) and that `n` is within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\). If `t` or `n` is out of the valid range, the function does not return any value but should handle the invalid inputs appropriately (e.g., by printing an error message or continuing to the next test case).**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `t` is less than 1 or greater than 50, the function should handle this case by skipping the corresponding test case or printing an error message.
- If `n` is less than 2 or greater than \(10^3\), the function should handle this case by skipping the corresponding test case or printing an error message.
- The function currently does not handle any explicit error messages for invalid inputs; it simply skips invalid test cases.
- The function does not validate the type of `t` and `n`; it assumes they are integers, which is correct given the problem statement. However, in a real-world scenario, additional checks might be necessary to ensure robustness.
