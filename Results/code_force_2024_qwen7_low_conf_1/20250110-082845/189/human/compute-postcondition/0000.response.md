The line `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This means that instead of using the standard `input()` function, `input()` will now refer to `sys.stdin.read()`. However, this does not provide any specific values to the variables `t` or `n`. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3; the input function is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`**
