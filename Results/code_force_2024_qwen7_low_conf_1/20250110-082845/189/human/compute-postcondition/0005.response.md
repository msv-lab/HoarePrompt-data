The code `n = int(data[i + 1])` impacts the program by assigning the value of the second element in the `data` list (after converting it to an integer) to the variable `n`. The previous value of `n` was an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, but now `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[i + 1]`.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.

After the code executes, the value of `n` changes to the integer value of `data[1]` (since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
