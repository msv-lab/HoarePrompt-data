The code `print(f'1 {i}')` prints the string '1 2' because `i` is currently 2. The variables `n` and `i` are updated as follows: `i` remains unchanged (still 2), and `n` is still greater than 3 (as no operations modify `n`). Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2**
