State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer value entered by the user.
```
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1)` will start from `i = 1` and go up to `i = n - 2`.
2. For the loop to execute, there must be at least two values within the range (1 and `n-2`).
3. This means `n` must be greater than 2 because if `n` were less than or equal to 2, the range would either be empty or contain only one value.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2**
