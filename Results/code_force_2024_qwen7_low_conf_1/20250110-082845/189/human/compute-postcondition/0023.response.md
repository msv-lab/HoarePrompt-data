The code `print(x, y)` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are not defined in the given code, they remain undefined. The values of `t`, `results`, `i`, and `result` are not affected either. 

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of pairs with at least two pairs, `i` is 1, `result` is the second pair in the `results` list, `x` is undefined, `y` is undefined**
