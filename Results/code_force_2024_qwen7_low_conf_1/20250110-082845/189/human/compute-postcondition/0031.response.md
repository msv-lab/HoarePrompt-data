The code `print(x, y)` simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since the code does not modify the values of `x` or `y`, their values remain unchanged after executing the print statement. The values of `x` and `y` are still the elements of the third pair in `results`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are the elements of the third pair in `results`**
