The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `data`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is an empty list.**
