`result` is assigned the value of `func_1(n)`. Since `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `result` will be the result of calling `func_1` with `n` as its argument. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.read`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `func_1(int(data[1]))`, `i` is 1, `result` is `func_1(n)`**
