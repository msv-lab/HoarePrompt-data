Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer. If `n` equals 2, the printed output is '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` equals 3, no change is made to the variables. If `n` equals 4, no change is made to the variables either. If `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and not equal to 3 or 4, `i` is set to `n - 2`.***
