The code prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are the first and second elements of the second tuple in the list `result`. However, the actual values of `x` and `y` themselves are not changed by the print statement. The `print` function does not alter the variables; it only outputs their current values.

Given the initial state:
- `result` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples.
- `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `result`.
- `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `result`.
- `index` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the provided code).

After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and they are printed to the console. The `print` function itself does not modify the variables.

Output State: **`result` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `result`, `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `result`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed to the console.**
