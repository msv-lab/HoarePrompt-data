The code `print(f'1 {i}')` prints the value of `i`, which is 3, preceded by '1 '. However, this does not change the values of the variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the print statement has executed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 3**
