According to the code, the loop iterates over each pair `(x, y)` in the `result` variable, which is the last pair in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a list of pairs.
- `i` is `t-1`.
- `result` is the last pair in the `results` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be true:

1. The `results` list must contain at least one pair because the loop is iterating over each pair in the `result` variable, which is the last pair in the `results` list.
2. The value of `i` must be adjusted to point to the first element of the `results` list, as `i` was set to `t-1` and needs to be reset to 0 for the loop to start from the beginning of the list.

Since `t` is at least 1, the `results` list must have at least one pair for the loop to execute at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be reset to 0, and `result` should be the first pair in the `results` list.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of pairs with at least one pair, `i` is 0, `result` is the first pair in the `results` list**
