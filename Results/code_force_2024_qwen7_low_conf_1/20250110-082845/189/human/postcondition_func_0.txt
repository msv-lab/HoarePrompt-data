The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 2 to 10^3. It initializes an empty list `points` and iterates over a range from 0 to `n-1`. During each iteration, it calculates `x` as `i + 1` and `y` as `(i * 2) % n + 1`, ensuring that `y` is within the specified range. These values are then appended as a tuple `(x, y)` to the `points` list. After completing the loop, the function returns the `points` list, which contains tuples `(x, y)` where `x` ranges from 2 to `n+1` and `y` ranges from 3 to `2n+1`. This process covers all integers `n` in the specified range, including the edge case when `n` is exactly 10^3.
