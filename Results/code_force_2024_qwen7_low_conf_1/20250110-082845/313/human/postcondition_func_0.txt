The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{15} \)), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers (where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)). For each test case, it repeatedly adjusts the values in list \( a \) by subtracting a value \( m \) (determined as the minimum of \( a[i] \), \( a[j] \), and \( k // 2 \)) from both ends of the list until either \( i \geq j \) or \( m \) becomes zero. Finally, it prints the number of elements in the list that have a non-zero value plus one if \( k \) is still greater than or equal to the remaining element \( a[i] \). The function implicitly returns nothing, but the printed value represents the result for each test case.
