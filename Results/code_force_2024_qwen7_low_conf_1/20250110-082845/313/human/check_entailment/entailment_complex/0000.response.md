Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
- It processes each test case by reading the number of ships, \( n \), and the number of attacks, \( k \), followed by the list of ship durabilities, \( a \).
- The logic inside the while loop is designed to simulate the attacks by reducing the durability of the first and last ships alternately until they sink or \( k \) becomes insufficient to attack further.
- The variables `i` and `j` represent the indices of the first and last ships, respectively. The loop continues as long as there are still ships that can be attacked (`i < j`) and there are still attacks left (`k // 2 > 0`).
- Inside the loop, the variable `m` is set to the minimum value among the current durability of the first and last ships and half of the remaining attacks (`k // 2`). This value is then used to reduce the durability of both the first and last ships.
- The loop condition `i < j` ensures that the first and last ships alternate being attacked.
- After exiting the loop, the program calculates the number of ships that remain undamaged and prints this value. Specifically, it calculates \( i + n - j - 1 + (k \geq a[i] > 0) \), which counts the surviving ships and checks if the last ship (if any) can still be attacked.

Given the detailed explanation and the logical flow of the code, the program appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements.
