Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the number of attacks `k` is less than the durability of the first or last ship. Specifically, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

In this case, both the first and last ships have a durability of 1, and the Kraken attacks each ship once. Both ships should sink, but the program incorrectly outputs 0. This indicates that the program does not correctly account for the scenario where `k` is less than the durability of the first or last ship, leading to an incorrect result.
