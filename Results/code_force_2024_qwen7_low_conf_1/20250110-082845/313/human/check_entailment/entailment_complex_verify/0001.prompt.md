You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: t` is 0, `n` is the value returned by `R()` after the loop, `k` is 0, `a` is an empty list, and the printed value is `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{15} \)), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers (where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)). For each test case, it repeatedly adjusts the values in list \( a \) by subtracting a value \( m \) (determined as the minimum of \( a[i] \), \( a[j] \), and \( k // 2 \)) from both ends of the list until either \( i \geq j \) or \( m \) becomes zero. Finally, it prints the number of elements in the list that have a non-zero value plus one if \( k \) is still greater than or equal to the remaining element \( a[i] \). The function implicitly returns nothing, but the printed value represents the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step and compare it with the problem statement.

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of durabilities `a`.

2. **Attack Logic**:
   - The program uses two pointers, `i` starting at 0 (first ship) and `j` starting at `n-1` (last ship).
   - In each iteration, it checks the minimum durability between the current first and last ship and half of the remaining attacks (`k // 2`), because the Kraken can attack both ships in one turn.
   - It decreases `k` by twice the minimum value (since the Kraken attacks both ships), and adjusts the durabilities of the ships accordingly.
   - If a ship's durability drops to zero, it updates the pointers appropriately (by checking `a[i] < 1` and `a[j] < 1`).

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - After the loop, the number of ships that have sunk is calculated as `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.
   - This formula counts the ships between the two pointers plus the ship at the `i` pointer if there are still remaining attacks that could sink it.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where ships sink and are no longer considered in future iterations.
   - It also correctly handles scenarios where the Kraken runs out of attacks before sinking all ships.

Given the logic aligns perfectly with the problem statement and the provided examples, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
