The code `lit.pop()` removes the last element from the `lit` list (assuming `lit` is a list, as `deque` was not specified). This impacts the following variables:

- `lit`: The last element is removed.
- `u`: Since `u` is defined as the last element of `lit` if `lastState == -1` or the first element of `lit` if `lastState == 0`, `u` will now be the new last element of `lit` (or the first element if `lastState == 0`).
- `k`: `k` is updated by subtracting `u` from it, so `k = k - u`.
- `sunk`: `sunk` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial conditions, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is the new last element of `lit`, `lit` is a list with one less element than before, `k` is `k - u`, `sunk` is incremented by 1, the value of `lastState` is either `0` or `-1` depending on whether the `if` condition (`lastState == -1`) is true or false.**
