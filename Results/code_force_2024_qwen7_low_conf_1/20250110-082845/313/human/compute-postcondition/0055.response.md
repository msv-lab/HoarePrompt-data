`t` is decremented by 1. The initial state was that `t` must be a non-zero value. After decrementing by 1, `t` will be one less than its original non-zero value, which means `t` is now a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value**
