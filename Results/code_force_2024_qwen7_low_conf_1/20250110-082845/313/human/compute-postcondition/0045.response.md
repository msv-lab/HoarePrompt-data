Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is decreased by `2 * m`, `i` is either 1 if `val - 2m < 1` or 0, `j` is 0 (because `a[j]` which is `val - 2m` is greater than 1), `a` is a list containing `val - 2m` as its first element and `val - 4m` at index 1.**
