The code `lit.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the deque `lit`. Since `u` is equal to `lit[-1]` and `lit.pop()` removes the last element, the value of `u` will no longer be the same as the last element in `lit`.

Let's break down the changes:

1. `lit.pop()` removes the last element from `lit`.
2. The value of `u` (which was equal to `lit[-1]`) is now undefined since the last element has been removed.
3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions and the code execution, the updated state of the variables is:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is unchanged.
- `lit` is a deque containing all elements except the last one.
- `u` is undefined (no longer equal to `lit[-1]`).
- `sunk` is incremented by 1, and `lastState` is -1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user except the last one, `u` is undefined, `sunk` is incremented by 1, and `lastState` is -1.**
