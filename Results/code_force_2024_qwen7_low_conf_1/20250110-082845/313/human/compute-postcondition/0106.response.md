The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of `t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, and `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 0, while `lit` is an empty deque and `k` is unchanged. After executing the code, `t` remains a positive integer, `a` remains an empty list, `lit` remains an empty deque, `lastState` remains -1, `sunk` remains 0, and `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is an empty deque, `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 0**
