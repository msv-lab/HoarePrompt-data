`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value, meaning `t` is equal to `initial_value_of_t - 1`. The code `n, k = R()` assigns the results of `R()` to `n` and `k`. Since the function `R()` is not defined in the context, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k`, but they are assigned from `R()`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value; `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`**
