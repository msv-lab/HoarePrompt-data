To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```python
while i < j and (m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)):
```

This means the loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < j`
2. `(m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))` evaluates to a non-zero value.

Let's break down the second condition:
- The expression `min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)` will evaluate to the minimum of the three values: `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`.
- For this to be non-zero, at least one of these values must be non-zero.

Given the current state:
- `t` is a non-zero value decreased by 1.
- `n` is the second element of the list `a`.
- `k` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

We need to ensure that `i < j` and `min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)` is non-zero for the loop to execute.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `i < j`:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - Since `n` is the second element of the list `a`, `j` is `a[1] - 1`.
   - For `i < j` to be true, `a[1] - 1 > 0` or `a[1] > 1`.

2. **Condition `min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)`:**
   - `a[i]` is `a[0]`.
   - `a[j]` is `a[n - 1]`.
   - `k // 2` is `a[0] // 2`.
   - For the minimum of these values to be non-zero, at least one of them must be non-zero.
   - Since `t` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `t` was initially non-zero, implying `a[0]` is non-zero.
   - `a[1]` (which is `n`) must also be such that either `a[0]` or `a[n - 1]` or `a[0] // 2` is non-zero.

### Conclusion:
- `n` (the second element of the list `a`) must be greater than 1 to satisfy `i < j`.
- At least one of `a[0]`, `a[1] - 1`, or `a[0] // 2` must be non-zero to satisfy the second condition.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is greater than 1 and at least one of `a[0]`, `a[1] - 1`, or `a[0] // 2` is non-zero.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `n` is the second element of the list `a` and must be greater than 1, `k` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1` and at least one of `a[0]`, `a[1] - 1`, or `a[0] // 2` must be non-zero**
