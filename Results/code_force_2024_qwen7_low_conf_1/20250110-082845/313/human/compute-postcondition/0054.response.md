Let's analyze the given state and the while loop condition step by step:

1. **Initial States After Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a non-zero value minus 1 (meaning `t` is currently 0).
   - `n` is the value returned by `R()`.
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `a` is a list where all elements are 0.
   - The printed value is `i + n - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `t` is non-zero (`while t:`).

3. **Condition Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must be non-zero.
   - Currently, `t` is 0 because it was a non-zero value minus 1.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To make the loop execute one more time, `t` must be set to a non-zero value. Since `t` is currently 0, we need to change it to a non-zero value.

5. **Other States:**
   - Other states like `n`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `a` do not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - We need to ensure that `t` is a non-zero value before the loop starts. Given that `t` was a non-zero value minus 1, the only state we need to adjust is `t`.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`t` must be a non-zero value**, `n` is the value returned by `R()`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list where all elements are 0, and the printed value is `i + n - 1`.
