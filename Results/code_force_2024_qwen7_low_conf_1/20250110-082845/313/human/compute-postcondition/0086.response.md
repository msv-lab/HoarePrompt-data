The code `lit.popleft()` removes the first element from the deque `lit`. The initial state is given as follows:

- `t` is a positive integer
- `a` is an empty list
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is `k - u`
- `lit` is a deque with the first element removed
- `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement
- `sunk` is 2
- `u` is the element assigned based on `lastState`

After executing `lit.popleft()`, the first element of `lit` is removed. Since `lit` was initially a deque with the first element removed, removing the first element means that `lit` now has one less element.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - u`, `lit` is a deque with two elements less than before the operation, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, `sunk` is 2, and `u` is the element assigned based on `lastState`.**
