`u` is assigned the value of `lit[lastState]`. Since `lastState` can be either `0` or `-1`, `u` will take the value of the last element of `lit` if it exists (i.e., `lastState == -1`), or the first element of `lit` if `lit` has only one element (i.e., `lastState == 0`). However, the exact value of `u` cannot be determined without knowing the actual content of `lit` and the value of `lastState`. 

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `u` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is the last element of `lit` if `lastState == -1` or the first element of `lit` if `lastState == 0`, `lit` is either a deque with one less element or the original `lit` with its first element removed, `k` is `k - u`, `sunk` is incremented by 1, the value of `lastState` is either `0` or `-1` depending on whether the `if` condition (`lastState == -1`) is true or false.**
