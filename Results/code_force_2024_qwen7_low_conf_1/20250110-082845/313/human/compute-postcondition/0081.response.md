The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the problem description, it implies that the function will handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of values for `n`, `k`, and `a`. The function processes these values according to the given constraints.

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

Given these inputs, the function will process each test case and return a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters implicitly through multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` (number of test cases), integers `n` and `k` for each test case, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
