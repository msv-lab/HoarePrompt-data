`j` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The value of `n` is returned by `R()`, so `j` becomes `R() - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value; `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value; `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`**
