The code `a[j] -= m` subtracts `m` from the element at index `j` in the list `a`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is a non-zero value minus 1.
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`.
- `k` is decreased by `2 * m`.
- `i` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `(val - 3m) < 1`.
- `j` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list containing `val - 3m` as its first element and `val - 4m` at index 1.

The list `a` initially looks like this: `a = [val - 3m, val - 4m]`.

Since `j` is greater than 0, `j` can only be 1 (as the list indices start from 0). Thus, the code modifies the second element of the list `a`.

So, `a[1] -= m` will modify the value at index 1 of the list `a` to `val - 4m - m`, which simplifies to `val - 5m`.

Therefore, the updated state of `a` is `[val - 3m, val - 5m]`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1; `n` is a value returned by `R()'; `k` is decreased by `2 * m`; `i` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `(val - 3m) < 1`; `j` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list containing `val - 3m` as its first element and `val - 5m` at index 1**
