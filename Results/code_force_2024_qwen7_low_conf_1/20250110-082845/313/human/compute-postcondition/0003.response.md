`t` is decremented by 1, changing its value from a non-zero value to a value that is still non-zero (since subtracting 1 from a non-zero value results in a non-zero value). The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\)**
