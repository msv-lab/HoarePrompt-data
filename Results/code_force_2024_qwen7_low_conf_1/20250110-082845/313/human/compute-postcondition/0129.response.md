Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The given loop is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will always execute unless explicitly broken out of.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is `k - u` where `u` is `u_last - 1` if `u` is defined (otherwise `u` is undefined).
   - `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user with possibly one less element.
   - `u` is either undefined or `u_last - 1`.
   - `sunk` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - Since it's a `while True` loop, no specific condition needs to be checked before the next iteration starts. Therefore, we don't need to adjust any states based on the loop condition itself.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - As there are no conditions inside the loop to check before proceeding to the next iteration, no states need to be modified to ensure the loop executes one more time.

**Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - u` where `u` is `u_last - 1` if `u` is defined (otherwise `u` is undefined), `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user with possibly one less element, `u` is either undefined or `u_last - 1`, `sunk` is incremented by 1**
