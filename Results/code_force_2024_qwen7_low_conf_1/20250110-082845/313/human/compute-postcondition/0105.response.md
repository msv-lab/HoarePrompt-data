Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is `k - len(lit) * u`, where `lit` is an empty deque, hence `len(lit) = 0`, so `k` remains unchanged.
   - `lit` is an empty deque.
   - `lastState` is -1.
   - `sunk` is 0.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations.
   - Since `t` is a positive integer, the loop will run exactly `t` times.
   - The loop does not modify `t` or use it in any condition checks inside the loop body.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `t` is a positive integer and does not change within the loop, the loop will execute `t` times.
   - The loop body is omitted, so no changes are made to the variables `a`, `k`, `lit`, `lastState`, or `sunk` during the loop execution.
   - After `t` iterations, the state remains as described above.

5. **Final States:**
   - `t` remains a positive integer.
   - `a` remains an empty list.
   - `n` remains an input integer.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `lit` remains an empty deque.
   - `lastState` remains -1.
   - `sunk` remains 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the final state after all iterations) is the same as the initial state at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is an empty deque, `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 0**
