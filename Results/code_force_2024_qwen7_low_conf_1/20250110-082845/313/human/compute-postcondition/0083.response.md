`u` is assigned the value of `lit[lastState]`. Given that `lit` is a deque with its first element removed, and `lastState` is either 0 or -1, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `lastState` is 0, then `u` will be assigned the first element of `lit`.
2. If `lastState` is -1, then `u` will be assigned the last element of `lit`.

Since `lit` is a deque with its first element removed, let's denote the elements in `lit` as `[element1, element2, ..., elementN]` before removal, which means after removal, `lit` could be `[element2, element3, ..., elementN]` (if the first element was removed) or `[element1, element2, ..., elementN-1]` (if the first element was the only one).

Therefore, the value of `u` depends on the value of `lastState`:

- If `lastState` is 0, then `u` is `element2` (or `element1` if the first element was the only one).
- If `lastState` is -1, then `u` is the last element of the remaining deque.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - u`, `lit` is a deque with the first element removed, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, `sunk` is 1, and `u` is the element assigned based on `lastState`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - u`, `lit` is a deque with the first element removed, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, `sunk` is 1, and `u` is the element assigned based on `lastState`**.
