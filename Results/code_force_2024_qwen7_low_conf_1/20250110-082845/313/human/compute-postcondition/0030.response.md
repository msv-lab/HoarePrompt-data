`n` and `k` are reassigned the values returned by `R()`. The function `R()` returns two values, but their specific values are not given. However, we know that initially `n` was the second element of the list `a` and at least 7, and `k` was `a[0] - 1 - 9 * m`. Since `R()` returns new values for `n` and `k`, these previous conditions no longer apply. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `i` is 1, 2, or 3, `j` is 2**
