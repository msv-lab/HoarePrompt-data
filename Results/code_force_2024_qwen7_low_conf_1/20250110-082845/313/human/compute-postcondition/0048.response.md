`a[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i] - m`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `a[0]` is updated to `val - 2m - m` which simplifies to `val - 3m`. The other elements of the list and the values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is decreased by `2 * m`, `i` is 0, `j` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `val - 3m` as its first element and `val - 4m` at index 1**
