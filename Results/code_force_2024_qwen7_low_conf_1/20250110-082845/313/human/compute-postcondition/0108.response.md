`lastState` is assigned the value `-1`. The value of `lastState` was previously `-1`, so it remains unchanged. All other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user, `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 0**
