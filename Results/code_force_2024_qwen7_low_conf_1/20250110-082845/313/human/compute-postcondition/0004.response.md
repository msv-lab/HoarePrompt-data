`n` and `k` are assigned the values of `R()`, which is a function call that returns two values. However, the specific values returned by `R()` are not known from the given information. The value of `t` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, and `a` is unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` from `R()`, and retains the pre-existing conditions for `t` and `a`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `R()`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)**
