`lit` is a deque with the first element removed, so the `pop` method removes the last element of `lit`. The value of `lastState` is either 0 or -1, which affects the value of `u`. However, since `k` is defined as `k - u`, and `u` is determined by `lastState`, the value of `k` will be updated accordingly. But since `k` is not directly affected by the `pop` operation, we only focus on the changes in `lit`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - u`, `lit` is a deque with the last element removed, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, `sunk` is 2, and `u` is the element assigned based on `lastState`.**
