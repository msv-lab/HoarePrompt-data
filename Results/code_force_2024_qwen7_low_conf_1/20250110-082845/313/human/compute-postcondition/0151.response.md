The code `lit.popleft()` removes the first element from the `lit` deque (or list). Given the initial state, `lit` is either a deque with one less element or the original `lit` with its first element removed. Since `popleft` removes the first element, `lit` will now be one element shorter.

- `t` remains a positive integer.
- `a` remains an empty list.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `u` was defined as the last element of `lit` if `lastState == -1` or the first element of `lit` if `lastState == 0`. After removing the first element, `u` would now be the second element in the new `lit`.
- `lit` is now a deque with one less element.
- `k` is updated by subtracting `u` from it.
- `sunk` is incremented by 1.
- `lastState` remains either `0` or `-1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is the second element of `lit`, `lit` is a deque with one less element, `k` is `k - u`, `sunk` is incremented by 1, `lastState` is either `0` or `-1`.**
