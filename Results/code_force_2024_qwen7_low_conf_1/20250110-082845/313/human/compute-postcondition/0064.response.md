`a[j]` is decremented by `m`. The value of `j` is unknown from the initial state, but it does not affect the calculation of `a[j]`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the relationship of `a[i]` are given, but the specific value of `a[j]` is not specified. The only change is in `a[j]`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value; `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is `k - 2 * m`, `a[i]` is the value of the i-th element of the tuple after subtracting `m`, `a[j]` is decreased by `m`.**
