Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- `t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value.
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`.
- `k` is `k - 2 * m`.
- `a[i]` is the value of the i-th element of the tuple after subtracting `m`.
- `a[j]` is decreased by `m`.
- `j` is decremented by 1 if `a[j] < 1`.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < j and (m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Condition `i < j`:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `j`.

2. **Condition `(m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))`:**
   - This condition checks if `m` is the minimum value among `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`.
   - For this condition to be true, `m` must be non-zero, as it is derived from `min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)` and `a[i]` and `a[j]` have already been modified in previous iterations.

### Required Adjustments
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the states such that both conditions are satisfied:
1. Ensure `i < j`.
2. Ensure `m` is non-zero (i.e., `m > 0`).

### Current States
- `t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value.
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`.
- `k` is `k - 2 * m`.
- `a[i]` is the value of the i-th element of the tuple after subtracting `m`.
- `a[j]` is decreased by `m`.
- `j` is decremented by 1 if `a[j] < 1`.

### Conclusion
To satisfy the loop condition:
- We need to ensure `i < j` remains true.
- We need to ensure `m > 0` (which implies `k - 2 * m > 0` and `a[i] > 0` and `a[j] > 0`).

Since `a[i]` and `a[j]` have been modified in previous iterations and `k` has been updated, the critical states to ensure the loop continues are:

- `i < j`
- `m > 0`

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value, `i < j`, `m > 0`**
