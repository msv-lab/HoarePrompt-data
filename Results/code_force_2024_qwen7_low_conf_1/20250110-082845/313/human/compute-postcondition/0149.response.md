`sunk` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `sunk` is `sunk + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is the last element of `lit` if `lastState == -1` or the first element of `lit` if `lastState == 0`, `lit` is either a deque with one less element or the original `lit` with its first element removed, `k` is `k - u`, `sunk` is incremented by 1, the value of `lastState` is either `0` or `-1` depending on whether the `if` condition (`lastState == -1`) is true or false.**
