`k` is initially decreased by `2 * m`. From the initial state, we know that `k` is already decreased by `2 * m`, so this operation simply reiterates the same decrease. The value of `k` remains the same as it was before the operation, which is `k` is decreased by `2 * m`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is decreased by `2 * m`, `i` is 0, `j` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `val - 2m` as its first element and `val - 4m` at index 1**
