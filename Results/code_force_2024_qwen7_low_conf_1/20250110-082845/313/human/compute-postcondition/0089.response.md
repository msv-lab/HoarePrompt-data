The value of `k` is decremented by `u`. The previous value of `k` was `k - u`, and since `k -= u` means `k` is now `k - u - u`, which simplifies to `k - 2u`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2u`, `lit` is a deque with at least one element less than before the operation, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, and `sunk` is 2.**
