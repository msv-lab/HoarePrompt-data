According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, we know:
- `t` is the value returned by `R()`.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The value of `t` directly determines whether the loop can execute. Since `t` is the value returned by `R()`, and `R()` returns a non-zero value to make the loop proceed, `t` needs to be a non-zero value for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is non-zero.

State: **`t` must be non-zero, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\)**
