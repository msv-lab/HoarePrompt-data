`sunk` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `sunk` is 1, so after the increment, `sunk` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - u`, `lit` is a deque with the first element removed, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, `sunk` is 2, and `u` is the element assigned based on `lastState`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - u`, `lit` is a deque with the first element removed, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, `sunk` is 2, and `u` is the element assigned based on `lastState`.**
