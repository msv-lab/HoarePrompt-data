Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2u`, `lit` is a deque with at least one element less than before the operation, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, and `sunk` is 2.***

Explanation: The overall postcondition combines both the if and else parts, indicating that regardless of whether `lastState` is 0 or -1, the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `lit`, and `sunk` retain their respective states as specified in the individual postconditions of the if and else parts. The only difference is in the value of `lastState`, which could be either 0 or -1 based on the condition evaluated in the if statement.
