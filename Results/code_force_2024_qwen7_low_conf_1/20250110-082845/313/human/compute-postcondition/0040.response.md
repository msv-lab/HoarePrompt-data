Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `t` is a non-zero value minus 1
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`
- `k` is decreased by `m * 2`
- `i` is 0 or 1 based on the value of `m`
- `j` is `r_j - 1` minus 1 if `a[r_j - 1] < 1` is `True`, otherwise `j` is `r_j - 1`
- `a` is a list containing the values returned by `R()` with the first element being `val - m` and the element at index `j` (where `j = R() - 1`) being `val - 2m`

### While Loop Condition:
```python
while i < j and (m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < j` and `(m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))` evaluates to a non-zero value.
   - `m` is assigned the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`.

2. **Initial Values at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0 or 1 based on `m`.
   - `j` is determined by the condition `j = r_j - 1` minus 1 if `a[r_j - 1] < 1` is `True`, otherwise `j` is `r_j - 1`.
   - `a` is a list with specific elements depending on the initial conditions.

3. **Determining Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i < j` must hold true.
   - `m` must be a non-zero value.

4. **Analyzing Each Component**:
   - **`i < j`**: This condition depends on the current values of `i` and `j`. Since we know `i` is 0 or 1, and `j` is calculated based on the list `a`, we need to ensure that `j` is greater than `i` in the next iteration.
   - **`m` being non-zero**: We need to ensure that `min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)` is non-zero. This means either `a[i]`, `a[j]`, or `k // 2` must be non-zero.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - To ensure `i < j`, we need to adjust `j` to be greater than `i` in the next iteration.
   - To ensure `m` is non-zero, we need to make sure that either `a[i]`, `a[j]`, or `k // 2` remains non-zero.

### Adjusted States:
- Ensure `j` is such that `j > i`.
- Ensure `k` is sufficiently large or `a[i]` and `a[j]` remain non-zero.

Given these requirements, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

**State:**
- `t` is a non-zero value minus 1
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`
- `k` must be sufficiently large or non-zero
- `i` is 0 or 1 based on the value of `m`
- `j` must be greater than `i`
- `a` is a list containing the values returned by `R()` with the first element being `val - m` and the element at index `j` (where `j = R() - 1`) being `val - 2m`

In summary:
State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` must be sufficiently large or non-zero, `i` is 0 or 1 based on the value of `m`, `j` must be greater than `i`, and `a` is a list containing the values returned by `R()` with the first element being `val - m` and the element at index `j` (where `j = R() - 1`) being `val - 2m`**
