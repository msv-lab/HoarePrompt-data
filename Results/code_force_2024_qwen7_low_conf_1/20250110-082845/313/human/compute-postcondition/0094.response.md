The code `lastState = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `lastState`. This overrides the previous value of `lastState`, which was either `0` or `-1` depending on the condition of the if statement. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2u`, `lit` is a deque with at least one element less than before the operation, `lastState` is -1, and `sunk` is 2.**
