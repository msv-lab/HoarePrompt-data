To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the conditions inside the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
\[ \text{while } i < j \text{ and } (m := \min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)) \]

Given the initial values:
- `t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value.
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`.
- `k` is a value returned by `R()`.
- `a` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i = 0`
   - `j = n - 1`

2. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - The first part of the condition is `i < j`. Given `i = 0` and `j = n - 1`, this part of the condition is always true as long as `n > 1`.
   - The second part of the condition is `(m := \min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))`. For this to evaluate to a non-zero value, at least one of the three arguments must be non-zero.

3. **Ensuring `m` is Non-Zero:**
   - Since `t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value, `t` itself can be used as an indicator that there is a non-zero value involved.
   - `a` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, so `a` could be any value, but it must be such that it contributes to `m` being non-zero.
   - `k` is a value returned by `R()`, so `k` could be any value, but it must be such that `k // 2` contributes to `m` being non-zero.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - To ensure that `m` is non-zero, at least one of `a[0]`, `a[n-1]`, or `k // 2` must be non-zero.
   - Since `t` is non-zero and exactly 1 less than its initial value, it implies that `t` is non-zero.
   - We need to ensure that either `a[0]`, `a[n-1]`, or `k // 2` is non-zero.

### Conclusion:
The key is to ensure that at least one of `a[0]`, `a[n-1]`, or `k // 2` is non-zero. Given that `t` is non-zero, we can infer that `a` and `k` should be such that they contribute to `m` being non-zero.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value.
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`.
- `k` is a value returned by `R()` such that `k // 2` is non-zero.
- `a` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()` such that either `a[0]` or `a[n-1]` is non-zero.

State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()` such that `k // 2` is non-zero, `a` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()` such that either `a[0]` or `a[n-1]` is non-zero.**
