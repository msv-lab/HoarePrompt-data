To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop will continue to execute:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < j` and `(m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))` is true.

2. **Current State**:
   - `t` is a non-zero value.
   - `n` is the second element of the list `a` and must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is `a[0] - 1 - 3 * m`.
   - `i` is 1 if `a[0]` is less than 1, otherwise `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n - 3` (since `j` is decremented by 1).
   - `a[j]` is decreased by `m`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `j`.
   - `m` must be the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states such that both conditions of the loop are satisfied for the next iteration.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1: `i < j`**
  - Currently, `i` is either 0 or 1 (depending on the value of `a[0]`).
  - `j` is `n - 3`, and since `n` is greater than 1, `j` will be a positive integer.
  - To ensure `i < j`, we need to ensure that `j` is sufficiently large relative to `i`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` should be at least 1 or 2 to satisfy `i < j`.

- **Condition 2: `m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)`**
  - `m` is determined by the values of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`.
  - Since `k` is defined as `a[0] - 1 - 3 * m`, and assuming `a[0]` is a fixed value, `k` will be a specific value based on `m`.
  - We need to ensure that there exists an appropriate `m` that satisfies `m <= a[i]`, `m <= a[j]`, and `m <= k // 2`.

### Adjusted States:
- **`i` and `j`**: To ensure `i < j`, `j` must be at least 2. Therefore, `n` must be at least 5 (since `j = n - 3`).
- **`k`**: The value of `k` is dependent on `m`, and since `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`, we need to ensure that there exists a valid `m` that fits all conditions.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `n` must be at least 5.
- `i` will be 0 or 1, but `j` must be at least 2, ensuring `i < j`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `n` is the second element of the list `a` and must be at least 5, `k` is `a[0] - 1 - 3 * m`, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is `n - 3` and must be at least 2, and `a[j]` is decreased by `m`**.
