The code `lastState = -1` simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `lastState`. The value of `lastState` is now explicitly set to `-1`, regardless of its previous state. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is either undefined or the new last element of `lit` if `lit` has elements, `lit` is either a deque with one less element or the original `lit` with its first element removed, `k` is `k - u`, `sunk` is incremented by 1, and `lastState` is `-1`. If `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
