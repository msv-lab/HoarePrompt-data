According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute. This means that no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to proceed to its first iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user, `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 0**
