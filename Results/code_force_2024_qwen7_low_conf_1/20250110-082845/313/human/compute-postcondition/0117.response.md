`lastState` is assigned the value `-1`. The value of `lastState` was not equal to `-1` before, so now it is specifically `-1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user, `lastState` is `-1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user, `lastState` is -1**
