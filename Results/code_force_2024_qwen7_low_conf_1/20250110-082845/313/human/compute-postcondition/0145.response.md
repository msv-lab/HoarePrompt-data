`lastState` is assigned the value `0`. This changes the value of `lastState` from `-1` to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is either undefined or the new last element of `lit` if `lit` has elements, `lit` is either a deque with one less element or the original `lit` with its first element removed, `k` is `k - u`, `sunk` is incremented by 1, and `lastState` is `0`.**
