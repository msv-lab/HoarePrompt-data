The code `lastState = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `lastState`. Since the initial value of `lastState` is either `0` or `-1`, the assignment changes its value to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2u`, `lit` is a deque with at least one element less than before the operation, `lastState` is 0, and `sunk` is 2.**
