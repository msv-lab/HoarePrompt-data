Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user with possibly one less element, `u` is either undefined or `u - 1`, and `sunk` is incremented by 1. If `lastState` is -1, then `u` is undefined. Otherwise, `u` is `u - 1` where `u` is the last integer in the `lit` deque before decrementing.***
