The code `lit.popleft()` removes the first element from the deque `lit`. Given the initial state, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user, and the current value of `u` (which is `lit[-1]`) is greater than `k`. After removing the first element, the new last element in the deque will be the second-to-last element from the original deque.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `lit` is a deque with one less element than before, and its last element is now `u - 1` (since the first element was removed).
- `u` is equal to the new last element in `lit`, which is `u - 1`.
- `sunk` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer; `k` is unchanged; `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user with one less element; `u` is `u - 1`; `sunk` is incremented by 1.**
