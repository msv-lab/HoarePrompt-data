The code `*a, = R()` unpacks the tuple returned by `R()` into a list `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value returned by `R()`, let's denote the returned tuple as `(r1, r2, ..., rn)`. This unpacking assigns the elements of the tuple to the elements of the list `a`. 

The initial state includes:
- `t` is a non-zero value minus 1
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`
- `k` is a value returned by `R()`
- `i` is 1, 2, or 3
- `j` is 2

After executing `*a, = R()`, the list `a` will contain the values returned by `R()`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `i` is 1, 2, or 3, `j` is 2, `a` is a list containing the values returned by `R()`**
