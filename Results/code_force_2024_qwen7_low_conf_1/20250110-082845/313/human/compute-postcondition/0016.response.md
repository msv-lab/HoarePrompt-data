`a[i]` is decremented by `m`. The value of `i` is either 0 or 1. Since the initial value of `n` is the second element of the list `a` and must be at least 5, and `j` is `n - 3` and must be at least 2, the initial value of `j` is `a[1] - 3` which is at least 2. The value of `a[j]` is decreased by `m`, but here `i` and `j` might refer to different elements of the list `a` depending on the value of `i`. However, since `a[j]` is already decreased by `m`, this does not affect the value of `a[i]` directly unless `i` equals `j`.

Given the information, the only change is in `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `n` is the second element of the list `a` and must be at least 5, `k` is `a[0] - 1 - 5 * m`, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is `n - 3` and must be at least 2, and `a[i]` is decreased by `m`.**
