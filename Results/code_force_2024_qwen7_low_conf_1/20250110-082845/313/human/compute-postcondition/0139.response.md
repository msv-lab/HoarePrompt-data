Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is either undefined or the new last element of `lit` if `lit` has elements, `lit` is either a deque with one less element or the original `lit` with its first element removed, `k` is adjusted accordingly (`k - u` where `u` is the last element of `lit` or undefined), `sunk` is incremented by 1, and `lastState` is set to `-1`. Regardless of the condition of the if statement, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
