Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, and `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user. `u` is equal to `lit[lastState]`, and the current value of `u` is less than or equal to `k`. `lastState` remains unchanged as either `-1` or `0`.**
