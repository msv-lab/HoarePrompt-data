`k` is decremented by `2 * m`. Since `m` is a variable from the initial state and its value is unknown, we will keep it as `m` in the updated state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is decreased by `2 * m`, `i` is 0 or 1 based on the value of `m`, `j` must be greater than `i`, `a` is a list containing the values returned by `R()` with the first element being `val - m` and the element at index `j` (where `j = R() - 1`) being `val - 2m`**
