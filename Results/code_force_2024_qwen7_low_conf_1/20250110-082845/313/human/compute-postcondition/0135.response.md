The code `u = lit[lastState]` assigns the value from the deque `lit` at the index `lastState` to the variable `u`. According to the initial state, `lastState` is set to `-1` regardless of the conditions of the if statement, so `u` will be assigned the value at index `-1` of `lit`.

Given the initial state:
- `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user with possibly one less element.
- If `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Regardless of the condition of the if statement, `lastState` is set to `-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if applicable.

Since `lastState` is `-1`, `u` will be assigned the value at the last element of `lit` (if `lit` is non-empty). However, since `lastState` is `-1`, and `-1` refers to the last element in a sequence, this means that `u` will be assigned the value at the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `u` is assigned the value at the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, otherwise `u` remains undefined.
- The states of other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user with possibly one less element, `k` is `k - u` where `u` is `u_last - 1` if `u` is defined (otherwise `u` is undefined), `sunk` is incremented by 1, and if `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Regardless of the condition of the if statement, `lastState` is set to `-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if applicable.**
