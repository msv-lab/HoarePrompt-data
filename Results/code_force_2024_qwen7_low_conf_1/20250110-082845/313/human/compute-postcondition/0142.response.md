According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as there is no condition to break out of it. This means that the loop will execute again regardless of the current state of the variables. 

Here's the breakdown of the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `u` is either undefined or the new last element of `lit` if `lit` has elements.
- `lit` is either a deque with one less element or the original `lit` with its first element removed.
- `k` is `k - u`.
- `sunk` is incremented by 1.
- `lastState` is set to `-1`.

Since the loop is `while True`, no adjustments are necessary to determine if the loop can execute one more time. The loop will simply continue executing based on its infinite nature.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is either undefined or the new last element of `lit` if `lit` has elements, `lit` is either a deque with one less element or the original `lit` with its first element removed, `k` is `k - u`, `sunk` is incremented by 1, and `lastState` is set to `-1`**
