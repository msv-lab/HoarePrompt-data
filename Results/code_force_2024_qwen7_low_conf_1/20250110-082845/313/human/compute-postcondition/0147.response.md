Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is either undefined or the new last element of `lit` if `lit` has elements, `lit` is either a deque with one less element or the original `lit` with its first element removed, `k` is `k - u`, `sunk` is incremented by 1. If `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `lastState` is either `0` or `-1` depending on whether the `if` condition (`lastState == -1`) is true or false.***
