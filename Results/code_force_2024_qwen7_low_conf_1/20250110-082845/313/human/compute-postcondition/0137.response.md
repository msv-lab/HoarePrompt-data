The code `lit.pop()` removes the last element from the deque `lit`. Since `lit` is a deque, popping the last element means that `lit` now has one less element. Given the initial conditions:

- `t` is a positive integer
- `a` is an empty list
- `n` is an input integer
- `u` is the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, otherwise it is undefined
- `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user with possibly one less element
- `k` is `k - u` where `u` is `u_last - 1` if `u` is defined (otherwise `u` is undefined)
- `sunk` is `sunk + 1`
- If `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Regardless of the condition of the if statement, `lastState` is set to `-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if applicable.

After executing `lit.pop()`:

- `lit` will have one less element than before.
- The value of `u` will no longer be the last element of `lit` because `lit` has lost its last element.
- The value of `k` will not be updated since `u` is no longer defined.
- `sunk` will be incremented by 1.
- `lastState` is set to `-1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `u` is undefined, `lit` is a deque with one less element, `k` is `k - u` where `u` is undefined, `sunk` is `sunk + 1`, `lastState` is `-1**
