Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer. `u` is either the new last element of `lit` (if `lastState == -1`), or the second element of `lit` (if `lastState == 0`). `lit` is either a list or a deque with one less element than before. `k` is updated by subtracting `u` from its previous value. `sunk` is incremented by 1, and `lastState` is either `0` or `-1` depending on whether the `if` condition (`lastState == -1`) is true or false. The function checks if `u <= k`, if true, `u`'s role and context are as described above; if false, no additional changes are made to the variables.***
