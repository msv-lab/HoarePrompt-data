The code `print(sunk)` simply prints the value of the variable `sunk`. Since `sunk` is defined as `len(lit)`, and `lit` is an empty deque (which means its length is 0), `sunk` is 0. The print statement does not change any variables but only outputs the current value of `sunk`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - len(lit) * u`, `lit` is an empty deque, `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 0**
