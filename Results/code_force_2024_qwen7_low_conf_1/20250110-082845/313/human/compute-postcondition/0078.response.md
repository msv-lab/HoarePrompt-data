Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is `k - 2 * m` after all iterations, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are modified based on the value of `m` and the conditions `a[i] < 1` and `a[j] < 1`, `i` is incremented when `a[i] < 1`, `j` is decremented by 1 when `a[j] < 1`, and `i` and `j` are otherwise adjusted according to the loop conditions.**
