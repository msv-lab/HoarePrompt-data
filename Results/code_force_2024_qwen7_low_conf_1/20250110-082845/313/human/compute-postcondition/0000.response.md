The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes input from the user and splits it into multiple integers, converting them to integers. However, this function does not assign any values to existing variables and instead returns a map object which is not immediately used in the provided snippet. Therefore, no variables are updated or assigned new values directly within the given code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Since the lambda function `R` is defined but not used to modify any existing variables, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\); `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\)**.
