Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - u` where `u` is `u_last - 1` if `u` is defined (otherwise `u` is undefined), `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user with possibly one less element, `u` is either undefined or `u_last - 1`, `sunk` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
