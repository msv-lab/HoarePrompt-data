`sunk` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `sunk` is 2, so after the increment, `sunk` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2u`, `lit` is a deque with fewer elements than before, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, and `sunk` is 3.**
