The code `lit = deque(list(map(int, input().split())))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a deque named `lit`. The initial state includes `t` being a positive integer, `a` being an empty list, `n` being an input integer, `k` being unchanged, `lit` being an empty deque, `lastState` being -1, and `sunk` being 0. After executing this code, the `lit` variable will hold the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user, `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 0**
