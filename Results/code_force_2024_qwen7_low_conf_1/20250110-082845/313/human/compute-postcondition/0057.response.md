The code `*a, = R()` unpacks the tuple returned by `R()` into the variable `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `R()`, let's denote the tuple returned by `R()` as `(b, c)`. Given the initial state where `t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value, and `n` and `k` are values returned by `R()`, we can update the state accordingly.

The output state will be:

- `t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value.
- `n` retains its value as it was returned by `R()`.
- `k` retains its value as it was returned by `R()`.
- `a` is assigned the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value; `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`**.
