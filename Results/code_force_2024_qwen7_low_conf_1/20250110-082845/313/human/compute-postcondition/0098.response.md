The code `lit.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the deque `lit`. This affects the `lit` deque, but not the other variables. Since `lit` originally had fewer elements than before, after this operation, it will have one less element.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2u`, `lit` is a deque with one fewer element than before, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, and `sunk` is 3.**
