The code `lit.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque `lit`. This operation will affect the variable `lit` and potentially the variable `u` if it was previously referencing the last element of `lit`.

- Initially, `u` is the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty.
- After `lit.popleft()`, the leftmost element of `lit` is removed, changing its state.

Let's consider two cases:

1. **Case 1:** If `lit` had elements before the removal, then `u` will be updated to the new last element of `lit` (which is now the second last element of the original `lit`).
2. **Case 2:** If `lit` was empty before this operation, then `u` remains undefined.

Since the exact state of `lit` before the operation is not specified, we need to account for both scenarios.

### Case 1: `lit` had elements
- `lit` loses its first element.
- `u` is updated to the new last element of `lit`.
- The condition `if len(lit) == 0 or k <= 0` is not checked because `lit` still has elements.
- The loop or if statement continues.

### Case 2: `lit` was empty
- `lit` is empty after the operation.
- `u` remains undefined.
- The condition `if len(lit) == 0 or k <= 0` evaluates to true, causing a break out of the loop or if statement.
- Regardless of the condition, `lastState` is set to `-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Since we don't know the exact initial state of `lit`, we consider the general impact:

- `lit` loses its first element.
- `u` is updated to the new last element of `lit` if `lit` had elements, otherwise it remains undefined.
- `lastState` is set to `-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`lit` is the original `lit` with its first element removed, `u` is the new last element of `lit` if `lit` had elements, otherwise `u` is undefined, `lastState` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
