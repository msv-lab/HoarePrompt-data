`u` is assigned the value of `lit[lastState]`. The value of `lit[lastState]` depends on the value of `lastState`. If `lastState` is `-1`, then `lit[-1]` does not exist, and if `lastState` is `0`, then `lit[0]` is assigned to `u`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, and `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user; `u` is equal to `lit[lastState]`. If `lastState` is `-1`, then `lastState` remains `-1`; if `lastState` is `0`, then `lastState` remains `0`.**
