To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop and analyze the current state.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while i < j and (m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State Before the Loop
- `t` is a non-zero value minus 1 (This state doesn't directly affect the loop execution, so no adjustment needed).
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`.
- `k` is a value returned by `R()`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `R() - 1`.
- `a` is a list containing the values returned by `R()`.

### Analysis of the Loop Condition
1. **Condition 1: `i < j`**
   - Currently, `i` is 0 and `j` is `R() - 1`. For this condition to hold true, `j` must be at least 1 (since `R()` returns an integer and `j` is `R() - 1`, `j` could be any positive integer).

2. **Condition 2: `(m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))`**
   - This part ensures that `m` is the minimum value among `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is the first element of the list `a`. The loop will only proceed if `m` is not zero (since the loop body uses `m` and would fail if `m` is zero).

### Determining Necessary Adjustments
- To satisfy `i < j`, `j` must be at least 1. Since `j` is `R() - 1`, we need to ensure that `R()` returns a value such that `j` is at least 1. Therefore, `R()` should return a value greater than or equal to 2.
- To satisfy `(m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))`, `a[i]` (the first element of `a`) must be non-zero, and the minimum value among `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2` must not be zero. Since `a[i]` is the first element of the list `a`, it should be a non-zero value. Additionally, `k // 2` should be non-zero to ensure that the minimum value is not zero.

### Adjusted States
- Ensure `R()` returns a value such that `j = R() - 1` is at least 1, meaning `R()` should return a value of 2 or higher.
- Ensure the first element of the list `a` (which is `a[0]`) is non-zero.

Given these requirements, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `i` is 0, `j` is `R() - 1` where `R()` returns a value of 2 or higher, `a` is a list containing the values returned by `R()` with the first element being non-zero**.
