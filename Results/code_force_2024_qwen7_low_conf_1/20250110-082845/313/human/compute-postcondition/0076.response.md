The code snippet `a[j] -= m` decreases the value of `a[j]` by `m`. Let's analyze the impact step by step:

1. The value of `a[j]` is decreased by `m`.
2. The value of `a[i]` is already known to be decreased by `m` from a previous operation.
3. The value of `j` may change based on a condition, but since this line does not change `j`, `j` remains unchanged.
4. Other variables (`t`, `i`, `k`, and `j_initial`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `a[j]` is decreased by `m`.
- `a[i]` is already decreased by `m`.
- `t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value.
- `i` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` was less than 1, otherwise `i` remains unchanged.
- `k` is the previous value of `k` minus `m * 2`.
- `j` is `j - 1` if `a[j_initial] < m + 1`, otherwise `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value; `i` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is less than 1, otherwise `i` remains unchanged; `a[i]` is decreased by `m`; `a[j]` is decreased by `m` by this operation; `a[j]` is decreased by `m`; `a[j_initial]` is decreased by `m`; `j` is `j - 1` if `a[j_initial] < m + 1`, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `k` is the previous value of `k` minus `m * 2`.**
