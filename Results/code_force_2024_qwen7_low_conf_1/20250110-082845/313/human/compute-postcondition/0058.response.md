The code `i = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. This assignment impacts only the variable `i`, and does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value.
- `n` is a value returned by `R()`.
- `k` is a value returned by `R()`.
- `a` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`.

After executing `i = 0`, the updated state includes the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value; `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `a` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `i` is 0**.
