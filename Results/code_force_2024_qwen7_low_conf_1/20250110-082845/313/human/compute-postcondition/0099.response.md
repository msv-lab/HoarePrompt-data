`lit`'s leftmost element is removed using `popleft()`. The value of `t` is unchanged, `a` remains an empty list, `n` remains an input integer, `k` is still `k - 2u`, `lit` now has one less element than before, `lastState` is still either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, and `sunk` remains 3.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2u`, `lit` has one less element than before, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, and `sunk` is 3.**
