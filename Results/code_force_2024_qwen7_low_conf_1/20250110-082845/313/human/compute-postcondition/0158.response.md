The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to take inputs in the form of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs but does not return anything explicitly from the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers.**
