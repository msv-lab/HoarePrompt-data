The value of `i` is set to 0. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `a` is a list containing the values returned by `R()`**
