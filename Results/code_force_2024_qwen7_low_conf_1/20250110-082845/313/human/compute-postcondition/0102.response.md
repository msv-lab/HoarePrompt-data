The code `k -= u` decreases the value of `k` by `u`. Initially, `k` is defined as `k - 2u`. After executing `k -= u`, the new value of `k` will be `(k - 2u) - u`, which simplifies to `k - 3u`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is a positive integer
- `a` is an empty list
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is now `k - 3u`
- `lit` is a deque with one fewer element than before
- `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement
- `sunk` is 3

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 3u`, `lit` is a deque with one fewer element than before, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, and `sunk` is 3.**
