The code assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `j`. The value of `n` is the second element of the list `a`, and the value of `k` is the first element of the list `a`. The value of `t` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, and the value of `i` is 0. After executing the line `j = n - 1`, the variable `j` will hold the value of `n - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `n` is the second element of the list `a`, `k` is the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`**
