`lastState` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `lastState` was `-1` before this assignment, so it changes to `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user, if `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `lastState` is `0`.
