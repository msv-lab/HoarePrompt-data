`sunk` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user, `u` is equal to `lit[lastState]`, and the current value of `u` is less than or equal to `k`; `sunk` is incremented by 1.
