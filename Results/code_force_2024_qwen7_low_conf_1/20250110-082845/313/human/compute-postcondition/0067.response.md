`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value, meaning \( t = \text{initial\_value} - 1 \). Variables `i < j` and `m > 0` remain unchanged. The code subtracts \( 2 \times m \) from `k`.

Let's denote the initial value of `k` as `k_initial`. After the operation, `k` becomes \( k_initial - 2 \times m \).

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value that is exactly 1 less than its initial value, `i < j`, `m > 0`; `k` is `k_initial - 2 * m`**
