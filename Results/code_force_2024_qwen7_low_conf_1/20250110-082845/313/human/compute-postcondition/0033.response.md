`j` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The value of `n` is a value returned by `R()`, so the new value of `j` is `R() - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `i` is 0, `j` is `R() - 1`, `a` is a list containing the values returned by `R()`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value minus 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `i` is 0, `j` is `R() - 1`, `a` is a list containing the values returned by `R()`**
