`u` is assigned the value of `lit[lastState]`. Given that `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `u` will take the value of the first or last element in the deque `lit`, respectively. Since the length of `lit` is at least one less after the operation, `lit` now has fewer elements than before. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - 2u`, `lit` is a deque with fewer elements than before, `lastState` is either 0 or -1 depending on the condition of the if statement, and `sunk` is 2.**
