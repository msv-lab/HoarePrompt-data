Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value, `n` is the second element of the list `a` and must be at least 7, `k` is `a[0] - 1 - 9 * m`, `i` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether `a[0]`, `a[1]`, or `a[2]` is less than 1, `j` is 2, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each decreased by `m` as many times as necessary until they become 0 or are no longer part of the loop, `j` is either `j-1` or `j` depending on whether `a[j] < 1` or not, and the loop continues until `i` is no longer less than `j` and at least one of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, or `k // 2` is non-zero.**
