`sunk` is reassigned to the value `0`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the `sunk` variable now holds the value `0`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged, `lit` is a deque containing integers entered by the user, `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 0**
