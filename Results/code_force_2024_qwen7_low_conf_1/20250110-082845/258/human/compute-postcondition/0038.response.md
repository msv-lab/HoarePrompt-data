The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). 

- Case_1: If a specific condition related to `x` results in a list containing only the element `[1]`, the function returns this list.
- Case_2: If another condition related to `x` results in a list 'a' of length `n-1` (where `n` is derived from `x`), containing `[1, -1]` followed by `n-3` zeros, the function returns this list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `x` and return either a list containing `[1]` or a list of length `n-1` containing `[1, -1]` followed by `n-3` zeros, depending on certain conditions related to `x`.
