The code `a = [0] * n` creates a list `a` with `n` (which is 1) elements, each initialized to 0. This affects the variable `a`. The variable `x` remains unchanged and is still 0. The variable `bits` is not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is: `x` is 0, `bits` is [0], `a` is [0].

Output State: **`x` is 0, `bits` is [0], `a` is [0]**
