`x` is shifted right by 1 bit, which means `x` is divided by 2 (integer division). The value of `bit` remains unchanged because it was determined based on the original value of `x`, and `bits` is a list containing only one element, which is `bit`.

Let's denote the original value of `x` as `x_original`. Since `x_original` is a positive integer and \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\), shifting `x` right by 1 bit results in `x >>= 1`, which is equivalent to `x = x_original // 2`.

- If `x_original` is even, `bit` is 0.
- If `x_original` is odd, `bit` is 1.

After the operation, `x` is updated to `x_original // 2`, and `bit` remains the same as before the shift operation.

Output State: **`x` is `x_original // 2`, `bit` is 0 if `x_original` is even and 1 if `x_original` is odd; `bits` is a list containing the value of `bit`.**
