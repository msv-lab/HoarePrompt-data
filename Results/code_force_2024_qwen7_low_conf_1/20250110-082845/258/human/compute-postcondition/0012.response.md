Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `x > 0`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is `x_original // 2`.
   - `bit` is 0 if `x_original` is even and 1 if `x_original` is odd.
   - `bits` is a list containing the value of `bit`.

3. **Determine the requirement for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must be greater than 0.
   - Given that `x` is initially set to `x_original // 2`, for `x` to be greater than 0 in the next iteration, `x_original` must have been at least 1 (since `x = x_original // 2`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is now `x_original // 2`, and we need `x` to be greater than 0 in the next iteration, `x_original` must have been at least 1.
   - The value of `bit` depends on the parity of `x_original`. It is 0 if `x_original` is even and 1 if `x_original` is odd. However, since the value of `bit` has already been recorded in `bits`, it doesn't need to be changed.
   - The list `bits` already contains the value of `bit` from the previous iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `x_original` was at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is `x_original // 2`, `bit` is 0 if `x_original` is even and 1 if `x_original` is odd; `bits` is a list containing the value of `bit`, and `x_original` must be at least 1**
