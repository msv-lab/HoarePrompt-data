Functionality: **The function processes a series of integers \(x\) (where \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\)) read from standard input, excluding the first integer which presumably contains the number of test cases \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)). For each \(x\), it calculates its binary representation in terms of a sequence of 1s and -1s, where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of \(x\). Specifically, the sequence starts with the least significant bit (LSB) and alternates between 1 and -1 depending on the bit value. The function then prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(x = 1\), the binary representation would be just a single 1, resulting in a sequence `[1]`.
- If \(x = 2^{30} - 1\) (i.e., the maximum possible value for \(x\) in the given range), the binary representation would be a sequence of 30 1s.
- If \(x = 0\), the function would still proceed but the sequence would be empty, resulting in printing `0`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where \(x\) might be outside the specified range (\(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\)), though the code should handle it gracefully due to the constraints of the problem.
- The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to standard output.
