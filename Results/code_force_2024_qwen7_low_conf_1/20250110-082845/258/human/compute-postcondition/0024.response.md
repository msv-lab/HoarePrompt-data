The code `a[i + 1] = -1` updates the element in list `a` at index `i + 1` to `-1`. Given the initial state where `a` is `[1]`, `i + 1` would refer to the second element (index 1) of the list `a`. After executing this line, `a` will be updated to `[1, -1]`.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `bits` is [True, True], `a` is [1, -1], `n` must be at least 2, and `bits[i + 1]` is True**
