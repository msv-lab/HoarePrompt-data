The code `bits.append(bit)` appends the value of `bit` (which is either 0 or 1) to the list `bits`. Since `bit` is determined by the least significant bit of `x`, the value of `bit` is either 0 or 1. The variable `x` is unchanged, and the variable `bits` now contains the value of `bit`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\) and `x` is not equal to 1; `bits` is a list containing one element which is either 0 or 1; `bit` is either 0 or 1 depending on the least significant bit of `x`.**
