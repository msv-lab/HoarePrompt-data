The code `bit = x & 1` is used to assign the value of `x & 1` to `bit`. Given the initial state, `x` is equal to `x_original // 2`, and `bit` is 0 if `x_original` is even and 1 if `x_original` is odd. The operation `x & 1` will yield the same result as the initial `bit` because `x` is derived from `x_original // 2` which effectively removes the least significant bit (the part that determines whether `x_original` is even or odd).

Since `x` is already `x_original // 2`, the operation `x & 1` does not change the value of `bit` as it remains the same as the initial `bit` based on `x_original`.

Output State: **`x` is `x_original // 2`, `bit` is 0 if `x_original` is even and 1 if `x_original` is odd, `bits` is a list containing the value of `bit`, and `x_original` must be at least 1.**
