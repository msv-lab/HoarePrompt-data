`x` is right-shifted by 1 bit, which means the least significant bit (LSB) of `x` is discarded, and each bit in `x` is shifted one position to the right. The value of `x` is now effectively divided by 2.

- `bits` contains the least significant bit of the original `x`, which is now the value of `bit`.
- After the shift, `x` becomes `x // 2`.

Since `bit` was originally the least significant bit of `x`, after the right shift, `bit` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `x` is now `x // 2`.
- `bit` remains the same.
- `bits` is unchanged and still contains the original LSB of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\) and `x` is not equal to 1; `bits` is a list containing one element which is either 0 or 1; `bit` is either 0 or 1 depending on the least significant bit of the original `x`.**
