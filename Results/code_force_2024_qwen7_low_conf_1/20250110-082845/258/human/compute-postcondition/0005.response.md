The code `bit = x & 1` calculates the bitwise AND of `x` and `1`. Since `1` in binary is `00000000000000000000000000000001`, the bitwise AND operation with any number `x` will result in the least significant bit (rightmost bit) of `x`.

Given that `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\), and `x` is not equal to 1, the value of `bit` will be `1` if the least significant bit of `x` is `1`, and `0` if the least significant bit of `x` is `0`.

The initial state of `bits` is an empty list, and this state is not affected by the code.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\), and `x` is not equal to 1; `bits` is an empty list; `bit` is either 0 or 1 depending on the least significant bit of `x`.**
