The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints, it implies that the function might internally use or process values `t` and `x` where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and for each test case, `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\).

Given the output cases are not specified, we can infer the function might return a value or a set of values based on the processed `t` and `x`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but processes two integers `t` and `x` where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\), and returns a value or values based on these inputs.**
