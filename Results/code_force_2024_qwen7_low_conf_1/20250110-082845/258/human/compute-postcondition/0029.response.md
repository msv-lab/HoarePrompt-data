The code snippet `a[i + 1] = -1` changes the value of `a[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `a` is `[1, -1]`, and `i` is assumed to be 0 since `a[i + 1]` would refer to the second element of the list. Therefore, `a[0 + 1]` is `a[1]`, which is already `-1`. The value of `a[1]` is updated to `-1`.

The states of the other variables (`x` and `bits`) are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `bits` is [True, True], `a` is [1, -1]**
