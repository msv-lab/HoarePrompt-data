The code `bit = x & 1` performs a bitwise AND operation between `x` and 1. For any integer `x`, `x & 1` will yield 1 if `x` is odd and 0 if `x` is even. Given the initial state that `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\) and `x` is not equal to 1, the value of `bit` will be 0 if `x` is even and 1 if `x` is odd.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\) and `x` is not equal to 1; `bit` is 0 if `x` is even and 1 if `x` is odd.**
