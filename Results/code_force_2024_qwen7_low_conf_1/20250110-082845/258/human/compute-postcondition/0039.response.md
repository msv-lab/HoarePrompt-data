Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). It processes `x` to generate a binary representation of `x` in reverse order and then constructs a list `a` based on this binary representation. 

If `x` is 1, the function directly returns `[1]`. Otherwise, it calculates the binary representation of `x` and stores it in the `bits` list. Then, it initializes an empty list `a` of length `n-1`, where `n` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `x`. For each bit position (except the last one), if the current bit is 1, it sets `a[i]` to 1; if the next bit is 1, it sets `a[i+1]` to -1. Finally, the function returns the list `a`.

In summary, the function returns either `[1]` if `x` is 1, or a list of length `n-1` containing `[1, -1]` followed by `n-3` zeros, where `n` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `x` (excluding the trailing zeros).**

This summary covers all potential cases and includes the necessary logic described in the code.
