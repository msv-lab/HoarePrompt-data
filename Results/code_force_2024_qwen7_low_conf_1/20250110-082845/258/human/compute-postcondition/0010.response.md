The code `bits.append(bit)` appends the value of `bit` to the list `bits`. The value of `bit` depends on the parity of `x`. Since `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\) and `x` is not equal to 1, `bit` will be 0 if `x` is even and 1 if `x` is odd. This operation does not change the value of `x` or the value of `bit`, but it adds the current value of `bit` to the list `bits`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{29}\) and `x` is not equal to 1; `bit` is 0 if `x` is even and 1 if `x` is odd; `bits` is a list containing the value of `bit`.**
