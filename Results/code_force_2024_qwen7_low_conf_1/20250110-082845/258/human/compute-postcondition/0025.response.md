Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `bits` is [True, True], `a` is [1, -1], `n` must be at least 2. This is because `bits[i + 1]` is True, leading to `x` remaining 0, `bits` becoming [True, True], `a` becoming [1, -1], and `n` remaining at least 2. Since there is no else part, these changes are the only possible outcomes.***
