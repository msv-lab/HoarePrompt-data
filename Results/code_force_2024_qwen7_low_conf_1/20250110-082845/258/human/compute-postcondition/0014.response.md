`bits.append(bit)` appends the current value of `bit` to the list `bits`. Since `bit` is either 0 (if `x_original` is even) or 1 (if `x_original` is odd), the value of `bits` will become a list containing the original `bit` value plus the newly appended `bit` value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is `x_original // 2`, `bit` is 0 if `x_original` is even and 1 if `x_original` is odd, `bits` is a list containing `[bit]`, and `x_original` must be at least 1.**
