`x` is right-shifted by 1 bit, which means its value is divided by 2 (integer division). Since `x` was originally set to `x_original // 2`, after the shift, `x` will now be `x_original // 4`. The value of `bit` remains unchanged because the right shift operation does not affect whether `x_original` is even or odd. The `bits` list also remains unchanged since no operation was performed on it.

Output State: **`x` is `x_original // 4`, `bit` is 0 if `x_original` is even and 1 if `x_original` is odd, `bits` is a list containing `[bit]`, and `x_original` must be at least 1.**
