You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24

Output

    0 0 0 -1 0 1

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure it satisfies the conditions of the problem statement. Specifically, the program should generate an array `a` that meets the following criteria:

1. The length `n` of the array `a` is between 1 and 32.
2. Each element `a_i` in the array is either 1, 0, or -1.
3. The sum of the elements, weighted by powers of 2, equals the given integer `x`.
4. There should not be any consecutive non-zero elements in the array.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Bit Extraction**: The function starts by extracting the binary representation of `x`. It iterates through the bits of `x`, appending each bit (either 0 or 1) to the `bits` list. This part is correct and ensures that the length of the `bits` list is at most 32.

2. **Array Construction**: After obtaining the binary representation, the function constructs the array `a` by iterating over the `bits` list. For each bit, if the bit is 1, it sets the corresponding position in `a` to 1. If the next bit is 1, it sets the next position in `a` to -1. However, this approach has a flaw:
   - The condition `if bits[i + 1]:` assumes that there will always be a next bit to check, which is not guaranteed if the length of `bits` is less than 2. Additionally, setting `a[i + 1]` to -1 without ensuring `bits[i]` is 1 might lead to invalid configurations.
   - Moreover, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will not have consecutive non-zero elements.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `x` is represented with fewer than 32 bits. For example, if `x` is a single bit (e.g., `x = 1`), the program should return `[1]`, but instead, it returns an empty array after constructing `a`.

4. **Returning the Result**: The function does not account for the possibility of returning multiple valid arrays, as required by the problem statement. It only returns one possible configuration, which might not always meet the requirement of no consecutive non-zero elements.

Given these issues, the provided program does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the program is not correct.
