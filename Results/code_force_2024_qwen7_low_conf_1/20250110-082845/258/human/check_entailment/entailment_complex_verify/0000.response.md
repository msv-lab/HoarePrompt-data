### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the annotated code and the provided problem description to evaluate the correctness of the function.

1. **Binary Representation**:
   - The function correctly computes the binary representation of `x` and stores it in the `bits` list in reverse order. For `x = 14`, the binary representation is `1110`, which gets stored as `[0, 1, 1, 1]`.

2. **Initialization of `a`**:
   - The list `a` is initialized with zeros of length `n`, where `n` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `x`. So for `x = 14`, `n = 4` and `a` starts as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

3. **Setting Values in `a`**:
   - The function iterates through the `bits` list (excluding the last element) and sets `a[i]` to `1` if the current bit is `1`. However, it incorrectly sets `a[i + 1]` to `-1` if the next bit is `1`. This leads to consecutive non-zero elements in some cases.

Let's verify this with the example `x = 14`:

- Binary representation: `[0, 1, 1, 1]`
- Iteration process:
  - `i = 0`: `bits[0] = 0`, so `a[0]` remains `0`.
  - `i = 1`: `bits[1] = 1`, so `a[1] = 1`.
  - `i = 2`: `bits[2] = 1`, so `a[2] = -1`.
  - `i = 3`: `bits[3] = 1`, so `a[3] = -1`.

Thus, the generated list `a` is `[-1, 1, -1, -1]`, which indeed has consecutive non-zero elements.

Given this analysis, the function does not meet the requirement of ensuring no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the array. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
