You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func_1(x):
    if x == 1:
        return [1]
    bits = []
    while x > 0:
        bit = x & 1
        bits.append(bit)
        x >>= 1
    n = len(bits)
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if bits[i]:
            a[i] = 1
        if bits[i + 1]:
            a[i + 1] = -1
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). It processes `x` to generate a binary representation of `x` in reverse order and then constructs a list `a` based on this binary representation. 

If `x` is 1, the function directly returns `[1]`. Otherwise, it calculates the binary representation of `x` and stores it in the `bits` list. Then, it initializes an empty list `a` of length `n-1`, where `n` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `x`. For each bit position (except the last one), if the current bit is 1, it sets `a[i]` to 1; if the next bit is 1, it sets `a[i+1]` to -1. Finally, the function returns the list `a`.

In summary, the function returns either `[1]` if `x` is 1, or a list of length `n-1` containing `[1, -1]` followed by `n-3` zeros, where `n` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `x` (excluding the trailing zeros).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not satisfy the requirement that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the array. Consider the test case `x = 14`. The expected output is `[0, -1, 0, 0, 1]`, but the program outputs `[-1, 0, 0, 0, 1]` when `x = 15`. This is because the program incorrectly sets `a[i + 1]` to `-1` whenever `bits[i + 1]` is `1`, leading to consecutive non-zero elements in certain cases. For example, when `x = 14`, the binary representation is `1110`, and the program generates `[0, -1, 0, -1]`, which violates the condition of having no two consecutive non-zero elements.
