Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x * x\), `y_min_sq` is \(r_squared - x_squared\), `y_max_sq` is \(r_squared + 2r - x_squared\). Since the `continue` statement inside the if part does not alter any variable values, the state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether the if condition is met or not.***
