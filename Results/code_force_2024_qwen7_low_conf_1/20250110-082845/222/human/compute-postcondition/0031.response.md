Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\). If \((x + 1)^2 < r^2\), `count` is incremented by \(2 \times \max(0, y_{max} - y_{min} + 1)\). Otherwise, `count` is incremented by \(2 \times y_max + 1\) where `y_max` is the floor of the square root of \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\) if \(r^2 - x^2 > 0\) else 0.***
