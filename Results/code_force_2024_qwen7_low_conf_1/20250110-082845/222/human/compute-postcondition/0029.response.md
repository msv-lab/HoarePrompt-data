Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\), `y_max_sq` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1) - x_squared - 1\), `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1) \times (r + 1) - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `y_max` to the floor value of the square root of `y_max_sq`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `y_max_sq` is defined as \((r + 1) \times (r + 1) - x_squared - 1\), and `y_max` is calculated as the floor of the square root of this expression, the output state reflects these changes while keeping the other variables intact.
