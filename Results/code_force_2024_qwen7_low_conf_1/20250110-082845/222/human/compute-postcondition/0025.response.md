The code updates `y_min` based on the condition involving `y_min_sq`. Let's analyze the impact step by step:

1. `y_min_sq` is defined as `r^2 - x^2`.
2. The code checks if `y_min_sq > 0`.
3. If `y_min_sq > 0`, then `y_min` is set to `math.ceil(math.sqrt(y_min_sq))`.
4. If `y_min_sq <= 0`, then `y_min` is set to `0`.

Since the condition `y_min_sq > y_max_sq` determines whether changes are made to the variables, and there is no explicit else part to modify other variables, the output state will only update `y_min` if the condition is met.

Given the initial conditions:
- `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2r - x^2\).
- `y_max` is either \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1) \times (r + 1) - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\) or \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - (x + 1)^2})\) if \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2 > 0\) else 0.

We need to determine if `y_min_sq > y_max_sq`:
- `y_min_sq = r^2 - x^2`
- `y_max_sq = r^2 + 2r - x^2`

For `y_min_sq > y_max_sq`:
\[ r^2 - x^2 > r^2 + 2r - x^2 \]
\[ -x^2 > 2r - x^2 \]
\[ 0 > 2r \]

This inequality is never true since \(r\) is a positive integer. Therefore, `y_min_sq` is never greater than `y_max_sq`.

As a result, the condition `y_min_sq > y_max_sq` is false, and no changes are made to the variables except for possibly `y_min`.

If `y_min_sq > 0`, then:
\[ y_min = \text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}) \]
Otherwise:
\[ y_min = 0 \]

However, since `y_min_sq > y_max_sq` is false, `y_min` remains as defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\), `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2r - x^2\), `y_max` is either \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1) \times (r + 1) - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\) or \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - (x + 1)^2})\) if \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2 > 0\) else 0, `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - x^2\), `y_min` is either \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2})\) if \(r^2 - x^2 > 0\) else 0.**
