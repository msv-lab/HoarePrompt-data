The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `r`. `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5. After executing the function body, it returns `count`, which is the final value determined by the loop.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `r` within the range of 1 to 10^5 and return the final value of `count` determined by the loop.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `r`, returns `count` which is the final value determined by the loop.**
