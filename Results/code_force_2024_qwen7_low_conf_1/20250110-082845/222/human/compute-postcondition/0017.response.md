Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`, `index` is `t + 1`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of `func_1(r)` for each `r` where `r` is the integer value of the elements in `data` starting from the second element up to the `(2*t - 1)`-th element.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`.
- Each iteration of the loop takes the integer value of the `index`-th element in `data` (starting from the second element), applies `func_1` to it, and appends the string representation of the result to the `results` list.
- After `t` iterations, `index` will be `1 + t` because `index` starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration.
- `results` will contain the string representations of `func_1(r)` for each `r` where `r` is the integer value of the elements in `data` starting from the second element up to the `(2*t - 1)`-th element.
