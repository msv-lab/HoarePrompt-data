`results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `func_1(r)`. The code appends the string representation of `func_1(r)` to the `results` list. The value of `r` is the integer value of the third element in the list `data`, and `func_1(r)` is called with `r` as an argument. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the integer value of the third element in the list `data`, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first is the string representation of `func_1(r)` and the second is the original element from the list.**
