`index` is incremented by 1. Initially, `index` is 4, so after the increment, `index` becomes 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the integer value of the fifth element in `data`, `t` must be greater than 1, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first is the string representation of `func_1(r)`, and the second is the original element from the list.
