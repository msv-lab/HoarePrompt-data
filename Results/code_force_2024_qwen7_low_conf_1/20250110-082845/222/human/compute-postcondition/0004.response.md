The code initializes an empty list called `results`. This does not affect the values of `r`, `data`, `t`, or `index`. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace; `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list**
