`index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is the second element in the list `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.
