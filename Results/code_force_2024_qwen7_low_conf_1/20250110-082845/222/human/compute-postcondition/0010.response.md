`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the second element in the list `data`, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `func_1(r)`. The code `r = int(data[index])` changes the value of `r` to be the integer value of the third element in the list `data`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the integer value of the third element in the list `data`, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `func_1(r)`**
