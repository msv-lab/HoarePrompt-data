Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\), `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2r - x^2\), `y_max` is either \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1) \times (r + 1) - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\) or \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - (x + 1)^2})\) if \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2 > 0\) else 0, `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - x^2\). If `y_min_sq > y_max_sq`, the condition is true and no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, there is no else part specified.***
