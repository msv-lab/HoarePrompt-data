The code increments `count` by `2 * y_max + 1` if `y_max` is non-negative. The value of `y_max` is calculated as \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1})\). Since the exact values of `r`, `x`, and the intermediate results are not provided, we need to consider the general case.

Let's denote:
- `r_squared = r * r`
- `r_plus_1_squared = (r + 1) * (r + 1)`
- `x_squared = x * x`
- `y_max_sq = (r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1`
- `y_max = \text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1})`

The value of `y_max` can be either a non-negative integer or zero, depending on the values of `r`, `x`, and the expression \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\).

If `y_max` is non-negative, `count` will be updated by adding \(2 * y_max + 1\) to its current value. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\)
- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\)
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\)
- `x_squared` is \(x * x\)
- `y_max_sq` is \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\)
- `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1})\)
- `count` is updated by adding \(2 * y_max + 1\) if `y_max` is non-negative, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `r_squared` is \(r \times r\); `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\); `x_squared` is \(x * x\); `y_max_sq` is \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\); `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1})\); `count` is updated by adding \(2 * y_max + 1\) if `y_max` is non-negative, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.**
