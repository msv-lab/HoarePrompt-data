The code calculates `y_max_sq` using the formula `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`. Let's break it down:

1. `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).
2. `x_squared` is \(x * x\).

So, `y_max_sq` is calculated as \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\).

Given the initial conditions:
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\).
- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\).
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).
- `x_squared` is \(x * x\).

The new value of `y_max_sq` is derived from the updated equation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x * x\), `y_max_sq` is \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1**.
