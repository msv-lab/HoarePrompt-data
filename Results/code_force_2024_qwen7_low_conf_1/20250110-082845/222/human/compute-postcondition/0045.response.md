To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and understand how the `count` variable is updated.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\).
   - `count` is initialized to 0.
   - `r_squared` is \(r \times r\).
   - `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `x` in the range \([-r, r]\).
   - For each `x`, `x_squared` is calculated as \(x \times x\).
   - The conditions inside the loop update `count` based on the values of `x_squared`, `y_min_sq`, `y_max_sq`, `y_min`, and `y_max`.

3. **Conditions Inside the Loop:**
   - If \(x^2 < r^2\):
     - `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - x^2\).
     - `y_max_sq` is \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\).
     - `y_min` is \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2})\) if \(r^2 - x^2 > 0\) else 0.
     - `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1})\).
     - `count` is updated by \(2 \times \max(0, y_{max} - y_{min} + 1)\).
   - If \(x^2 \geq r^2\):
     - `y_max_sq` is \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\).
     - `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1})\).
     - `count` is updated by \(2 \times y_max + 1\) if \(y_max \geq 0\), otherwise it remains unchanged.

4. **Final State:**
   - After the loop finishes executing, `count` will be the final value determined by the above conditions.
   - `r`, `r_squared`, and `r_plus_1_squared` retain their original values since they are not modified within the loop.
   - `x_squared` is the square of the last `x` in the range \([-r, r]\).
   - `y_max_sq` and `y_min_sq` depend on the specific values of `x` and the conditions in the loop.
   - `y_min` and `y_max` are the ceiling and floor of the square roots, respectively, based on the conditions in the loop.

### Final Output State:

**Output State:**
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\).
- `count` is the final value determined by the loop, which is the sum of the contributions from all valid `x` values.
- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\).
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).
- `x_squared` is the square of the last `x` in the range \([-r, r]\).
- `y_max_sq` and `y_min_sq` are dependent on the specific `x` values and the conditions in the loop.
- `y_min` and `y_max` are the ceiling and floor of the square roots, respectively, based on the conditions in the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is the final value determined by the loop, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is the square of the last `x` in the range \([-r, r]\), `y_max_sq` and `y_min_sq` are dependent on the specific `x` values and the conditions in the loop, and `y_min` and `y_max` are the ceiling and floor of the square roots, respectively, based on the conditions in the loop.**
