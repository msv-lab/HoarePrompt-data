According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Given the initial state, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than 0.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `r` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\). This does not affect the loop's execution directly.
2. The list `data` is obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace. This does not affect the loop's execution directly.
3. The variable `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. The variable `index` is initially set to 1. This does not affect the loop's execution directly.
5. The list `results` is initially empty. This does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
