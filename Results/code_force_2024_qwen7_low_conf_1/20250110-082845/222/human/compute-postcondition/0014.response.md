`r` is reassigned to the integer value of the element at index `index` in the list `data`. Since `index` is 4, `r` is now the integer value of the fifth element in the list `data`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the integer value of the fifth element in `data`, `t` must be greater than 1, `index` is 4, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first is the string representation of `func_1(r)`, and the second is the original element from the list.
