The code `continue` is used inside a loop to skip the remaining part of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since no loop context is provided, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The `continue` statement does not alter any variable values.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x * x\), `y_min_sq` is \(r_squared - x_squared\), `y_max_sq` is \(r_squared + 2r - x_squared\)**
