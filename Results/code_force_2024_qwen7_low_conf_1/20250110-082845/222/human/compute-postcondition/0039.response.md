The code assigns `y_max` the value of the floor of the square root of `y_max_sq`. Given that `y_max_sq` is defined as `r_squared + 2*r - x_squared`, we substitute this into the equation:

\[ y_max = \left\lfloor \sqrt{r^2 + 2*r - x^2} \right\rfloor \]

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state includes the new value of `y_max`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\), `y_min_sq` is \(r_squared - x_squared\), `y_max_sq` is \(r_squared + 2*r - x_squared\), `y_min` is either \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2})\) if \(r^2 - x^2 > 0\), or 0 if \(r^2 - x^2 \leq 0\), `y_max` is \(\left\lfloor \sqrt{r^2 + 2*r - x^2} \right\rfloor\)**.
