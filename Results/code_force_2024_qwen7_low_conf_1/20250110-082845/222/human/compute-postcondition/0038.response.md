The code calculates `y_min` based on the condition `y_min_sq > 0`. If `y_min_sq` is greater than 0, `y_min` is assigned the ceiling of the square root of `y_min_sq`; otherwise, `y_min` is set to 0. However, since `y_min_sq` is defined as `r_squared - x_squared` and `r_squared` and `x_squared` are derived from the initial conditions, the calculation for `y_min` will depend on the values of `r_squared` and `x_squared`.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\)
- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\)
- `x_squared` is \(x \times x\)
- `y_min_sq` is \(r_squared - x_squared\)

We need to determine the value of `y_min` based on the condition.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, let's consider the general case:

1. If `y_min_sq` is greater than 0, then `y_min` is calculated as:
   \[
   y_min = \text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{y_min_sq}) = \text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2})
   \]

2. If `y_min_sq` is less than or equal to 0, then `y_min` is 0.

Since the problem does not specify the value of `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `y_min_sq` without knowing `x`. However, the output state should reflect the possible values based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\), `y_min_sq` is \(r_squared - x_squared\), `y_max_sq` is \(r_squared + 2r - x_squared\), `y_min` is either \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2})\) if \(r^2 - x^2 > 0\), or 0 if \(r^2 - x^2 \leq 0\).**
