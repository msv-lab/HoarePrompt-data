According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the integer value of the third element in the list `data`, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 3, and `results` is a list containing two elements: the first is the string representation of `func_1(r)`, and the second is the original element from the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1. Additionally, since the loop increments `index` by 1 each time it iterates, `index` will be incremented to 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the integer value of the third element in the list `data`, `t` must be greater than 1, `index` is 4, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first is the string representation of `func_1(r)`, and the second is the original element from the list.**
