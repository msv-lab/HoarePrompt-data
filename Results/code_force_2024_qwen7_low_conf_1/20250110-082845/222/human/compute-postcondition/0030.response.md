The code increments `count` by `2 * y_max + 1` if `y_max` is non-negative, otherwise, it does not change `count`. Let's analyze the variables involved:

- `y_max` is defined as \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1) \times (r + 1) - x_squared - 1})\).
- `y_max_sq` is defined as \((r + 1) \times (r + 1) - x_squared - 1\).

Since `y_max_sq` is the expression under the square root, we can substitute it back into the definition of `y_max`:

\[ y_max = \text{math.floor}(\sqrt{y_max_sq}) \]

Given the initial state, `y_max` can either be a non-negative integer or 0, depending on the value of `y_max_sq`.

Therefore, the code will increment `count` by `2 * y_max + 1` if `y_max` is non-negative.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted by `2 * y_max + 1` if `y_max` is non-negative, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\), `y_max_sq` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1) - x_squared - 1\), `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1) \times (r + 1) - x_squared - 1})\)**
