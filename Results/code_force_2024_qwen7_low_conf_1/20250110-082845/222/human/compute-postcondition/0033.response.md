The code snippet assigns the value of `x * x` to `x_squared`. The initial state includes that `r` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), and `x_squared` is \((x_{\text{next}})^2\). Since the code only updates `x_squared`, the values of `r`, `count`, `r_squared`, `r_plus_1_squared`, and `x_squared` (now updated) are the key variables affected.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x * x\)**
