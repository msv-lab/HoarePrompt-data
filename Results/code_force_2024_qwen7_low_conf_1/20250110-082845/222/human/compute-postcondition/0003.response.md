The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`. The initial values of `r` and `data` remain unchanged, and `t` is still the integer value of the first element in the list `data`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace; `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`; `index` is 1**
