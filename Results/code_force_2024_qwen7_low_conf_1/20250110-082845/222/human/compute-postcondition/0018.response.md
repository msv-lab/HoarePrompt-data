The code prints each element of the `results` list, each on a new line, using `'\n'.join(results)`. This does not modify any of the variables, it only outputs their values.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data`, `index` is `t + 1`, `results` is a list containing the string representations of `func_1(r)` for each `r` where `r` is the integer value of the elements in `data` starting from the second element up to the `(2*t - 1)`-th element. No variables are modified by the code.**
