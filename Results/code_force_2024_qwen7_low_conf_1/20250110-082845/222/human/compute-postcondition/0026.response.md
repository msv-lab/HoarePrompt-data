The code `y_max = math.floor(math.sqrt(y_max_sq))` impacts the calculation of `y_max`. Given the initial conditions:

- `y_max_sq` is defined as \(r^2 + 2r - x^2\)
- `y_max` is initially defined as either \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1) \times (r + 1) - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\) or \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - (x + 1)^2})\) if \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2 > 0\) else 0

After executing the line `y_max = math.floor(math.sqrt(y_max_sq))`, `y_max` is reassigned to the floor of the square root of `y_max_sq`. Since `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2r - x^2\), `y_max` is now the floor of the square root of \(r^2 + 2r - x^2\).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\), `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2r - x^2\), `y_max` is the floor of the square root of \(r^2 + 2r - x^2\), `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - x^2\), `y_min` is either \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2})\) if \(r^2 - x^2 > 0\) else 0.**
