`count` is incremented by twice the maximum of 0 and the difference between `y_max` and `y_min` plus one. The values of `r`, `r_squared`, `x_squared`, `y_min_sq`, and `y_max_sq` are unchanged. The value of `y_min` is either the ceiling of the square root of `r_squared - x_squared` if this value is positive, or 0 if it is not. The value of `y_max` is the floor of the square root of `r_squared + 2*r - x_squared`.

Since the exact values of `r` and `x` are not specified, let's consider a generic case where `r` and `x` are such that `r_squared - x_squared > 0` and `r_squared + 2*r - x_squared` results in a perfect square or a non-perfect square.

Let's assume:
- `r_squared - x_squared` is a positive value, so `y_min` is calculated as `math.ceil(math.sqrt(r_squared - x_squared))`.
- `r_squared + 2*r - x_squared` is a perfect square, so `y_max` is calculated as `math.floor(math.sqrt(r_squared + 2*r - x_squared))`.

In this case:
- `y_max - y_min + 1` is a non-negative integer.
- `max(0, y_max - y_min + 1)` is `y_max - y_min + 1`.
- `count += 2 * (y_max - y_min + 1)`.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated `count` and the unchanged `r`, `r_squared`, `x_squared`, `y_min_sq`, `y_max_sq`, `y_min`, and `y_max`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted by \(2 * (\left\lfloor \sqrt{r^2 + 2*r - x^2} \right\rfloor - \text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}) + 1)\), `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\), `y_min_sq` is \(r_squared - x_squared\), `y_max_sq` is \(r_squared + 2*r - x_squared\), `y_min` is \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2})\), `y_max` is \(\left\lfloor \sqrt{r^2 + 2*r - x^2} \right\rfloor\)**.
