The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is 2, so after the increment, `index` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the integer value of the third element in the list `data`, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `func_1(r)`**
