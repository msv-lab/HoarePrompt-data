`results` is an empty list, and `r` is the second element in the list `data`. The code appends the string representation of `func_1(r)` to the `results` list. Since the exact value of `r` and the function `func_1` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended to `results`. However, we know that `results` will now contain one element, which is the string representation of `func_1(r)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the second element in the list `data`, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `func_1(r)`**
