The code `y_max_sq = r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1` updates the value of `y_max_sq`. Given the initial state:

- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\)
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\)
- `x_squared` is \(x \times x\)

The equation \(y_max_sq = r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1\) calculates the new value of `y_max_sq` based on the current values of `r`, `r_plus_1_squared`, and `x_squared`.

Since the calculation does not depend on the previous value of `y_max_sq` and only uses the values of `r`, `r + 1`, and `x`, the output state will reflect this new value of `y_max_sq`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\), `y_max_sq` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1) - x_squared - 1\), `y_max` is either \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1) \times (r + 1) - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\) or \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - (x + 1)^2})\) if \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2 > 0\) else 0.**
