The code calculates `y_max` by taking the floor of the square root of `y_max_sq`. Given the formula for `y_max_sq` is \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\), the code now computes the square root of this value and floors it to get an integer value for `y_max`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `r` and `x`, the calculation for `y_max_sq` remains in its general form. The values of `r`, `r_squared`, `r_plus_1_squared`, and `x_squared` are unchanged, and the only new value being introduced is `y_max`, which is computed from `y_max_sq`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x * x\), `y_max_sq` is \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\), `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1})**.
