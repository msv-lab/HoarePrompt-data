Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\). If \(x^2 < r^2\), `count` is adjusted by \(2 * (\left\lfloor \sqrt{r^2 + 2*r - x^2} \right\rfloor - \text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}) + 1)\), `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - x^2\), `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2*r - x^2\), `y_min` is \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - x^2})\), and `y_max` is \(\left\lfloor \sqrt{r^2 + 2*r - x^2} \right\rfloor\). Otherwise, `count` is updated by adding \(2 * y_max + 1\) where `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1})\), and if `y_max` is negative, `count` remains unchanged.***
