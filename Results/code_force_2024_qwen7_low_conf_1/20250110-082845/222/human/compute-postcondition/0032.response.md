Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- \( r \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq r \leq 10^5 \).
- \( \text{count} \) is adjusted according to the condition.
- \( \text{r_squared} = r \times r \).
- \( \text{r_plus_1_squared} = (r + 1) \times (r + 1) \).
- \( \text{x_squared} = x \times x \).

The loop increments \( x \) from \(-r\) to \( r \). The condition inside the loop is:
- If \((x + 1)^2 < r^2\), then \(\text{count}\) is incremented by \(2 \times \max(0, y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}} + 1)\).
- Otherwise, \(\text{count}\) is incremented by \(2 \times y_{\text{max}} + 1\), where \(y_{\text{max}}\) is the floor of the square root of \((r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\) if \(r^2 - x^2 > 0\) else 0.

### Loop Iteration:
At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the new state for the next iteration of the loop. 

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Value of \( x \)**:
   - Let \( x_{\text{current}} \) be the value of \( x \) at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Next Value of \( x \)**:
   - In the next iteration, \( x \) will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, \( x_{\text{next}} = x_{\text{current}} + 1 \).

3. **Update Condition**:
   - Check the condition \((x_{\text{next}} + 1)^2 < r^2\).
   - If true, increment \(\text{count}\) by \(2 \times \max(0, y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}} + 1)\).
   - Otherwise, increment \(\text{count}\) by \(2 \times y_{\text{max}} + 1\).

4. **Update \( y_{\text{max}} \)**:
   - Calculate \( y_{\text{max}} \) based on the condition:
     - \( y_{\text{max}} = \lfloor \sqrt{(r + 1)^2 - x_{\text{next}}^2 - 1} \rfloor \)
     - If \( r^2 - x_{\text{next}}^2 > 0 \), use this formula; otherwise, \( y_{\text{max}} = 0 \).

### New State:
- \( r \) remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- \( \text{count} \) is updated based on the condition described above.
- \( \text{r_squared} \) remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- \( \text{r_plus_1_squared} \) remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- \( \text{x_squared} \) is updated to \((x_{\text{next}})^2\).

### Final State:
- **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\)**.
- **`count` is adjusted according to the condition**.
- **`r_squared` is \(r \times r\)**.
- **`r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\)**.
- **`x_squared` is \((x_{\text{next}})^2\)**.

### State Adjustment:
Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration and the logic of the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \((x_{\text{next}})^2\)**.

Where \( x_{\text{next}} = x_{\text{current}} + 1 \).
