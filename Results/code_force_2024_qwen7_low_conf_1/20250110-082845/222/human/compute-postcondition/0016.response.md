`results` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is the string representation of `func_1(r)` and the second element is the original element from the list `data`. The code appends the string representation of `func_1(r)` to the `results` list. The value of `r` is the integer value of the fifth element in `data`.

Therefore, the first element of `results` is updated to include `str(func_1(r))`, and the second element remains unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the integer value of the fifth element in `data`, `t` must be greater than 1, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first is the string representation of `func_1(r)`, and the second is the original element from the list `data`.**
