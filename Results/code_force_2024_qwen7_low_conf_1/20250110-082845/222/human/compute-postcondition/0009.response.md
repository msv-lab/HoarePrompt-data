According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the second element in the list `data`, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, and `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `func_1(r)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain greater than 0. Since `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the last iteration, it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue. No other state needs to be adjusted as the loop counter `_` and the `results` list will be updated within the loop body.

State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `r` is the second element in the list `data`, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `func_1(r)`**
