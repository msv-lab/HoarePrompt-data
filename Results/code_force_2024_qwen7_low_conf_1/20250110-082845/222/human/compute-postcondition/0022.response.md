`y_max_sq` is reassigned the value of `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`. Given the definitions:

- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\),
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\),
- `x_squared` is \(x \times x\).

We can substitute these into the equation:

\[ y_max_sq = (r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ y_max_sq = r^2 + 2r + 1 - x^2 - 1 = r^2 + 2r - x^2 \]

So, the updated value of `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2r - x^2\). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\), `count` is adjusted according to the condition, `r_squared` is \(r \times r\), `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), `x_squared` is \(x \times x\), `y_max_sq` is \(r^2 + 2r - x^2\), `y_max` is either \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{(r + 1) \times (r + 1) - (x + 1)^2 - 1})\) or \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{r^2 - (x + 1)^2})\) if \(r^2 - (x + 1)^2 > 0\) else 0, `y_min_sq` is \(r^2 - x^2\)**.
