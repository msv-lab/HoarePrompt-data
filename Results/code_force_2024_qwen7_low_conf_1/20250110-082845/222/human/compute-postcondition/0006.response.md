The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `r`. Given that `index` is 1, `r` is assigned the second element in the list `data`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is the second element in the list `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`r` is the second element in the list `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by whitespace, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
