The function `func_2` reads multiple integers from standard input, processes them using another function `func_1`, and prints the results. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `r` (where \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\)). For each integer `r`, it calls `func_1(r)` and appends the result (as a string) to the `results` list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. Potential edge cases include the input not being within the expected range or format, but the code does not explicitly handle these cases.
