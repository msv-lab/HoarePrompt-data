#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5.
def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r
    #The program returns 3 times r squared, where r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `r` such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\). It computes and returns the value \(3 \times r^2\). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function squares the input integer `r`, multiplies the result by 3, and returns the final value.
