Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses the formula `3 * r * r` to calculate the number of lattice points. However, this formula is incorrect for calculating the number of lattice points within the specified Euclidean distance range.

To understand why the program is incorrect, consider the example with `r = 1`. According to the problem description, we need to count the lattice points such that the Euclidean distance from (0, 0) is greater than or equal to 1 but strictly less than 2. For `r = 1`, the valid lattice points are `(1, 0)`, `(-1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0, -1)`, `(1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, and `(-1, -1)`, which makes a total of 8 points. However, the program calculates `3 * 1 * 1 = 3`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for at least one input case, making it incorrect.
