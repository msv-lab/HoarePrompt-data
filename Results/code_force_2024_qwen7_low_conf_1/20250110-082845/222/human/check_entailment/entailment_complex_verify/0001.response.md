### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given code to determine the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We need to find the number of lattice points \((x, y)\) such that the Euclidean distance from \((0, 0)\) satisfies \( r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r + 1 \).
   - This means the points must lie within the annulus (ring-shaped region) defined by the two concentric circles centered at \((0, 0)\) with radii \( r \) and \( r + 1 \).

2. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve this, we would need to iterate over possible integer values of \( x \) and \( y \) within the range \([-r, r]\) and check if \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) falls within the range \([r, r+1)\).
   - Count the number of valid points for each test case.

3. **Current Program's Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(r)` returns \( 3 * r * r \).
   - This formula does not match the expected logic for counting lattice points in the specified range of distances.

4. **Verification**:
   - Let's consider a few test cases to see why the current implementation is incorrect:
     - For \( r = 1 \):
       - Expected lattice points: \((1, 0)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, -1)\), \((1, 1)\), \((1, -1)\), \((-1, 1)\), \((-1, -1)\) (8 points).
       - Current output: \(3 * 1^2 = 3\).
     - For \( r = 2 \):
       - Expected lattice points: Points that satisfy \(2 \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < 3\) (16 points).
       - Current output: \(3 * 2^2 = 12\).

   - The current implementation clearly does not count the lattice points correctly.

5. **Annotated Code Re-evaluation**:
   - The annotated code states that the function returns \(3 \times r^2\), which is incorrect. This does not align with the problem requirements.
   - The example outputs provided do not match the expected results based on the problem constraints.

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for counting lattice points in the specified range of distances.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
