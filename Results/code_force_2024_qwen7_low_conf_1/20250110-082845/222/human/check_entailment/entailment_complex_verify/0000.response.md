### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to count lattice points \((x, y)\) such that \(r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r + 1\).
- The Euclidean distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).
- The function `func_1` should compute the number of such lattice points for a given \(r\).

#### Provided Code:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The function `func_1(r)` simply returns \(3 \times r^2\).
- This annotation correctly describes the function's behavior.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the formula \(3 \times r^2\) is incorrect for counting the number of lattice points within the specified Euclidean distance range.
- To verify this, let's manually check the example provided in the problem statement for \(r = 1\).

#### Example Verification:
- For \(r = 1\):
  - Valid distances: \(1 \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < 2\)
  - Possible integer values for \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) in this range are \(\sqrt{1}, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{4}\).
  - Valid lattice points:
    - Distance \(\sqrt{1}\): \((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)\) → 4 points
    - Distance \(\sqrt{2}\): \((1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)\) → 4 points
    - Total points: 4 (from \(\sqrt{1}\)) + 4 (from \(\sqrt{2}\)) = 8 points
  - The function `func_1(1)` returns \(3 \times 1^2 = 3\), which is incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
- A more accurate approach involves counting lattice points in circles of radius \(r\) and \(r+1\).
- The number of lattice points in a circle of radius \(r\) can be approximated using the Gauss Circle Problem, but for simplicity, we can manually verify small values.
- The function `func_1(r)` should return the difference in the number of lattice points between two concentric circles of radii \(r\) and \(r+1\).

#### Conclusion:
- The provided function \(3 \times r^2\) does not accurately count the lattice points as described in the problem.
- The original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
