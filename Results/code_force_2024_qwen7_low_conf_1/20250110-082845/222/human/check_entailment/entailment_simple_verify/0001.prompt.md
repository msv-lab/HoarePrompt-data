You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an integer r , find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean
distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to r but strictly less than r+1 .

A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates. The Euclidean distance
from (0, 0) to the point (x,y) is \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer r (1 \leq r \leq
10^5 ).

The sum of r over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of lattice points
that have an Euclidean distance d from (0, 0) such that r \leq d < r+1 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5.
def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r
    #The program returns 3 times r squared, where r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the number of lattice points that have an Euclidean distance from (0, 0) between \( r \) and \( r + 1 \). The formula provided in the program suggests a different approach compared to what is expected based on the problem statement.

2. **Expected Solution**:
   - For a given radius \( r \), we need to count the number of lattice points \((x, y)\) where \( r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r + 1 \).
   - This involves counting points within a ring defined by two concentric circles centered at (0, 0) with radii \( r \) and \( r + 1 \).

3. **Current Program's Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(r)` currently returns \( 3 * r * r \).
   - This formula does not match the expected logic for counting lattice points in the specified range of distances.
   - A more appropriate approach would involve iterating over possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) and checking if they fall within the required distance range.

4. **Verification**:
   - The given solution does not correctly implement the logic for counting lattice points.
   - The example outputs provided do not match the expected results based on the problem constraints.

Based on the above reasoning:

Correctness: **False**
