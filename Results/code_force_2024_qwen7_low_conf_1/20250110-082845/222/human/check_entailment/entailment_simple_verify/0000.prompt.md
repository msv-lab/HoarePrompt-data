You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an integer r , find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean
distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to r but strictly less than r+1 .

A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates. The Euclidean distance
from (0, 0) to the point (x,y) is \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer r (1 \leq r \leq
10^5 ).

The sum of r over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of lattice points
that have an Euclidean distance d from (0, 0) such that r \leq d < r+1 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5.
def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r
    #The program returns 3 times r squared, where r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses the formula `3 * r * r` to calculate the number of lattice points. However, this formula is incorrect for calculating the number of lattice points within the specified Euclidean distance range.

To understand why the program is incorrect, consider the example with `r = 1`. According to the problem description, we need to count the lattice points such that the Euclidean distance from (0, 0) is greater than or equal to 1 but strictly less than 2. For `r = 1`, the valid lattice points are `(1, 0)`, `(-1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0, -1)`, `(1, 1)`, `(1, -1)`, `(-1, 1)`, and `(-1, -1)`, which makes a total of 8 points. However, the program calculates `3 * 1 * 1 = 3`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for at least one input case, making it incorrect.
