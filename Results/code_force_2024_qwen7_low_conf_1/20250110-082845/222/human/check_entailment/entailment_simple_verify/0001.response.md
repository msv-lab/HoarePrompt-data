### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of lattice points \((x, y)\) such that \( r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r + 1 \).
   - This means we need to count lattice points within a specific annulus (ring) centered at the origin with inner radius \( r \) and outer radius \( r + 1 \).

2. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to iterate over all possible integer coordinates \((x, y)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \( r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r + 1 \).
   - The naive approach would be to iterate over a reasonable range of \( x \) and \( y \) values and count those that meet the criteria.

3. **Current Program's Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(r)` currently returns \( 3 * r * r \).
   - This formula does not correspond to any known method for counting lattice points in the specified range of distances.
   - The formula \( 3 * r * r \) is not derived from the geometric properties of lattice points in the given annulus.

4. **Verification**:
   - Let's analyze the example outputs to see if the current implementation matches the expected results:
     - For \( r = 1 \): The expected result should be the number of lattice points such that \( 1 \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < 2 \). These points are \((\pm 1, \pm 1)\) and \((\pm 1, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1)\), giving us 8 points. However, the program outputs 3.
     - For \( r = 2 \): The expected result should be the number of lattice points such that \( 2 \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < 3 \). These points include \((\pm 2, \pm 2)\), \((\pm 2, \pm 1)\), \((\pm 1, \pm 2)\), and some others, which totals to 16 points. However, the program outputs 12.
     - The provided example outputs clearly show that the program's output does not match the expected results.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's logic is incorrect because it uses a formula that does not count the lattice points as required.
   - The example outputs further confirm that the program does not implement the correct solution.

### Final:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it uses an inappropriate formula to count the lattice points, and the example outputs do not match the expected results.
