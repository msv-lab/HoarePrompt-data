Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the number of lattice points that have an Euclidean distance from (0, 0) between \( r \) and \( r + 1 \). The formula provided in the program suggests a different approach compared to what is expected based on the problem statement.

2. **Expected Solution**:
   - For a given radius \( r \), we need to count the number of lattice points \((x, y)\) where \( r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r + 1 \).
   - This involves counting points within a ring defined by two concentric circles centered at (0, 0) with radii \( r \) and \( r + 1 \).

3. **Current Program's Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(r)` currently returns \( 3 * r * r \).
   - This formula does not match the expected logic for counting lattice points in the specified range of distances.
   - A more appropriate approach would involve iterating over possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) and checking if they fall within the required distance range.

4. **Verification**:
   - The given solution does not correctly implement the logic for counting lattice points.
   - The example outputs provided do not match the expected results based on the problem constraints.

Based on the above reasoning:

Correctness: **False**
