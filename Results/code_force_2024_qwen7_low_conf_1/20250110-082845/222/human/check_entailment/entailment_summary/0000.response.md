Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to check if the formula used in `func_1` matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

The problem asks us to count the number of lattice points \((x, y)\) such that \(r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r+1\).

However, the function `func_1` simply returns \(3 \times r^2\), which does not match the logic required to solve this problem. To actually count the number of such lattice points, we would need to consider the area of a ring between two concentric circles centered at \((0,0)\) with radii \(r\) and \(r+1\). This involves a more complex calculation involving sums of areas of squares within these rings.

Since the given function does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem, it cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
