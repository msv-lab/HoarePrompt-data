Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem statement, the task is to find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to \( r \) but strictly less than \( r+1 \).

However, the `func_1` function in the annotated program simply returns \( 3 \times r^2 \). This does not accurately reflect the number of lattice points within the specified distance range. To correctly solve this problem, the function should calculate the number of lattice points within the annulus (ring-shaped region) defined by the distances \( r \) and \( r+1 \).

The correct approach would involve counting the number of integer pairs \((x, y)\) such that \( r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r+1 \). This can be more complex and typically involves iterating over possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) and checking the condition. However, even a simpler approximation (such as using areas of circles) would not yield the simple formula \( 3 \times r^2 \).

Given the problem constraints and the expected output for various test cases, it is clear that the provided implementation does not match the requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
