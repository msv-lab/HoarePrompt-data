Reasoning:
- The problem requires counting the number of lattice points \((x, y)\) such that \(r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r+1\).
- For a given \(r\), the equation \(r^2 \leq x^2 + y^2 < (r+1)^2\) describes a region between two circles centered at the origin. 
- To count these lattice points, one approach involves iterating over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) within the bounds that satisfy the inequality.
- However, the provided function `func_1(r)` simply returns \(3 \times r^2\), which does not correctly implement the logic needed to count lattice points.

The function's current implementation is incorrect because it does not account for the actual number of lattice points within the specified range. Instead, it returns a value that is unrelated to the lattice point count.

Correctness: **False**
