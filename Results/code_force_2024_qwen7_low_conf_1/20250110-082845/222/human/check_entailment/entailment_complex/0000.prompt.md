You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an integer r , find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean
distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to r but strictly less than r+1 .

A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates. The Euclidean distance
from (0, 0) to the point (x,y) is \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer r (1 \leq r \leq
10^5 ).

The sum of r over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of lattice points
that have an Euclidean distance d from (0, 0) such that r \leq d < r+1 .

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5.
def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r
    #The program returns 3 times r squared, where r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `r` such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\). It computes and returns the value \(3 \times r^2\). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function squares the input integer `r`, multiplies the result by 3, and returns the final value.
