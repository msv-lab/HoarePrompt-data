The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `n` is 1, it sets `e` to `a`. Otherwise, it calculates two values `c` and `d`, where `c` is `a * n` and `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, and then sets `e` to the minimum of `c` and `d`. After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `e` for each test case.
