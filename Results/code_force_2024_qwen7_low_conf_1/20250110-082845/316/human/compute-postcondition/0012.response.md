The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. This affects the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`, but does not change the initial state of `t` and the expressions involving `c` and `d`.

The initial state includes:
- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is `a * n` if `n` is not 1, otherwise `c` is not defined
- `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a` if `n` is not 1, otherwise `d` is not defined
- `e` is `a` if `n` is 1, otherwise `e` is `min(a * n, b + (n - 2) * a)`

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the input values. The values of `c` and `d` remain undefined unless `n` is not 1, and `e` is updated according to the new value of `n`.

Let's denote the input values as follows:
- Let `n_input` be the input integer for `n`
- Let `a_input` be the input integer for `a`
- Let `b_input` be the input integer for `b`

Then the output state is:
- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`
- `n` is `n_input`
- `a` is `a_input`
- `b` is `b_input`
- `c` is `a_input * n_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `c` is not defined
- `d` is `b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `d` is not defined
- `e` is `a_input` if `n_input` is 1, otherwise `e` is `min(a_input * n_input, b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input)`

Since the exact values of `n_input`, `a_input`, and `b_input` are not specified in the problem, we will keep them as symbols.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is `n_input`, `a` is `a_input`, `b` is `b_input`, `c` is `a_input * n_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `c` is not defined, `d` is `b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `d` is not defined, `e` is `a_input` if `n_input` is 1, otherwise `e` is `min(a_input * n_input, b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input)**
