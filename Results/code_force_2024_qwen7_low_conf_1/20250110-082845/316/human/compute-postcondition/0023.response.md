The initial state provides several conditions and values:
- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This implies `t` must be 1 because the only number that is equal to itself minus 1 is 1.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is the input integer.
- `b` is the input integer.
- `c` is `a * n`.
- `d` is not defined if `n` is 1, otherwise `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`.

The code snippet sets `d` to `b + (n - 2) * a`. Since `n` is not specified to be 1, `d` is defined and updated according to this formula.

Given that `t` is specifically stated to be 1 and does not change, the output state should reflect the updated value of `d` based on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`**
