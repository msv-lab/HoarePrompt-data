The code assigns the value of `b + (n - 2) * a` to the variable `d`. We know the following from the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`
- `n` is `n_input`
- `a` is `a_input`
- `b` is `b_input`
- `c` is `a_input * n_input`
- `d` is not defined
- `e` is `min(a_input * n_input, b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input)` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `e` is not defined.

Since `d` is being assigned a new value, we calculate `d` as follows:
\[ d = b + (n - 2) \cdot a = b_input + (n_input - 2) \cdot a_input \]

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is `n_input`, `a` is `a_input`, `b` is `b_input`, `c` is `a_input * n_input`, `d` is `b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input`, `e` is `min(a_input * n_input, b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input)` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `e` is not defined.**
