Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `n` is 1, it sets `e` to `a`. Otherwise, it calculates two values `c` and `d`, where `c` is `a * n` and `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, and then sets `e` to the minimum of `c` and `d`. After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `e` for each test case.**

**Edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The code assumes `t` is always within the range `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are within their respective ranges. However, there is no validation to ensure these constraints are met.
- The code does not handle cases where `n` is 1 correctly. Specifically, the annotation states that `e` is set to `a` when `n` is 1, but the code directly assigns `e = a` without considering the possibility that `e` might already be assigned a value from a previous iteration of the loop.
- There is no handling for invalid inputs such as non-integer values for `n`, `a`, or `b`. The code uses `int(input())` to read inputs, which may raise a `ValueError` if the input is not a valid integer.
- The state of the program after the function concludes includes `t` being 0, indicating that the counter `t` is reset to 0 after processing all test cases. However, the final state of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` is not explicitly mentioned, but since the `for` loop has completed, these variables will hold the last processed values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`, respectively.
