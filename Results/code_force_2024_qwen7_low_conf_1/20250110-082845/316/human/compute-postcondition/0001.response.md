State before the loop starts: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` determines the number of iterations, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
