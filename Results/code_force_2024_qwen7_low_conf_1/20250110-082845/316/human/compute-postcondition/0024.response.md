`e` is assigned the minimum value between `c` and `d`. Given that `c` is `a * n` and `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, the value of `e` will depend on the comparison between `a * n` and `b + (n - 2) * a`.

- If `a * n` is less than or equal to `b + (n - 2) * a`, then `e` is `a * n`.
- If `a * n` is greater than `b + (n - 2) * a`, then `e` is `b + (n - 2) * a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`.**
