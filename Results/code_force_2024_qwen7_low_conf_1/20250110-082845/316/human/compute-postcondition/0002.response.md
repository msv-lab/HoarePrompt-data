The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, but we know they are integers. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` > 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
