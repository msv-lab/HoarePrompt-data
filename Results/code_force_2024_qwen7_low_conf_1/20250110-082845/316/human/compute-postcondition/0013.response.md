The code `e = a` assigns the value of `a` to `e`. The value of `a` is `a_input`, so `e` is now `a_input`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is `n_input`, `a` is `a_input`, `b` is `b_input`, `c` is `a_input * n_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `c` is not defined, `d` is `b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `d` is not defined, `e` is `a_input`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is `n_input`, `a` is `a_input`, `b` is `b_input`, `c` is `a_input * n_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `c` is not defined, `d` is `b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `d` is not defined, `e` is `a_input`**
