`c` is assigned the value of `a * n`. The value of `a` is `a_input`, and the value of `n` is `n_input`. Therefore, the value of `c` becomes `a_input * n_input`.

- The initial condition that `c` is `a_input * n_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `c` is not defined, still holds true because the value of `n` did not change and is `n_input`.
- The value of `d` and `e` remains unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is `n_input`, `a` is `a_input`, `b` is `b_input`, `c` is `a_input * n_input`, `d` is not defined, `e` is `min(a_input * n_input, b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input)` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `e` is not defined.**
