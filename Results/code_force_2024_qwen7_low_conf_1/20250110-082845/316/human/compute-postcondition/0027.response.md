Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is not defined, `d` is not defined, `e` is not defined.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer.
- If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute at all.
- When the loop does not execute, all the variables related to the loop body (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`) remain undefined.
- Since the loop runs exactly `t` times, once `t` becomes 0, the loop stops, and all the variables involved in the loop body become undefined.
