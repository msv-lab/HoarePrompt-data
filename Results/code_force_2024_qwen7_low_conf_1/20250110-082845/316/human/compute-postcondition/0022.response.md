The code `c = a * n` updates the value of `c`. Given the initial state, if `n_input` is not 1, then `c` is updated to `a * n`. Since the initial state specifies that `c` is `a_input * n_input` if `n_input` is not 1, and `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` (which is always true for any positive integer), the value of `c` changes to `a * n`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `t` is still greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` remains the input integer, `a` remains the input integer, and `b` remains the input integer.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is not defined if `n` is 1, otherwise `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a**.
