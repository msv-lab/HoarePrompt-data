Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer, `c` is `a * n` if `n` is not 1, otherwise `c` is defined as `a_input * n_input` from the precondition, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a` if `n` is not 1, otherwise `d` is defined as `b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input` from the precondition, and `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`.**
