`e` is assigned the value of the minimum between `c` and `d`. Given that `c = a * n` and `d = b + (n - 2) * a`, we know the values of `c` and `d` in terms of `a`, `b`, and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `n` is an input integer and is not equal to 1, and `t` is greater than 0, these conditions are still valid. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `c` is `a * n`
- `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`
- `e` is the minimum of `c` and `d`

Output State: **`t` > 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 1; `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is `min(a * n, b + (n - 2) * a)`**
