Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is `n_input`, `a` is `a_input`, `b` is `b_input`, `c` is `a_input * n_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `c` is not defined, `d` is `b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input` if `n_input` is not 1, otherwise `d` is not defined, `e` is `a_input` if `n_input` is 1, otherwise `e` is `min(a_input * n_input, b_input + (n_input - 2) * a_input)***
