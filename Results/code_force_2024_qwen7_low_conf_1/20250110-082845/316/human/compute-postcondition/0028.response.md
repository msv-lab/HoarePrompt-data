The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function should handle multiple test cases where for each test case, it receives three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints for these integers are: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (though `t` is not used in the function's output), `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30`.

The function does not return anything explicitly based on the given output cases. It appears the function might be processing or calculating something with `n`, `a`, and `b`, but the exact output is not specified beyond the structure of the test cases.

Given the provided information and adhering strictly to the format requested:

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes test cases where it receives integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with specific constraints, and returns based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
