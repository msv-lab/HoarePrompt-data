Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is greater than or equal to twice the individual price `a`. In such cases, it is always cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at price `a`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 6 10
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to buy one yogurt at a time since the promotion price (10 burles for two yogurts) is more expensive than buying each yogurt individually (6 burles each). However, the current implementation calculates `c` as `a * n` (which is `6 * 3 = 18`) and `d` as `b + (n - 2) * a` (which is `10 + (3 - 2) * 6 = 16`). It then prints the minimum of these two values, which is 16.

The correct output should be `18` because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper in this scenario. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle this edge case.
