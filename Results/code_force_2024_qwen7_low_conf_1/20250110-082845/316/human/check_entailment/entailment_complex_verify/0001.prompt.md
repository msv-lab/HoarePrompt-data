You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            c = a * n
            d = b + (n - 2) * a
            e = min(c, d)
        print(e)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            c = a * n
            d = b + (n - 2) * a
            e = min(c, d)
        
        print(e)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is not defined, `d` is not defined, `e` is not defined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `n` is 1, it sets `e` to `a`. Otherwise, it calculates two values `c` and `d`, where `c` is `a * n` and `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, and then sets `e` to the minimum of `c` and `d`. After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `e` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying \( n \) yogurts based on the given conditions.

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
3. If \( n = 1 \), the cost is simply \( a \) because only one yogurt is bought.
4. Otherwise, it calculates the cost in two ways:
   - Buying all yogurts at the regular price: \( c = a \times n \).
   - Using the promotion where every second yogurt is bought at the reduced price \( b \). This involves buying pairs of yogurts, so the number of pairs is \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) and the remaining yogurts are \( n \mod 2 \). Thus, the cost is \( d = b \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + a \times (n \mod 2) + a \times \left( n - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \times 2 \right) \).
5. It then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The logic in the program accurately follows the problem statement. For each test case, it calculates the cost using both the regular and promotional methods and outputs the minimum value. Therefore, the program should be correct according to the given problem description.
