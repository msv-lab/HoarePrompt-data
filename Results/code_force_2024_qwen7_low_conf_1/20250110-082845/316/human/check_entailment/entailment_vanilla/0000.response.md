Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying \( n \) yogurts based on the given conditions.

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
3. If \( n = 1 \), the cost is simply \( a \) because only one yogurt is bought.
4. Otherwise, it calculates the cost in two ways:
   - Buying all yogurts at the regular price: \( c = a \times n \).
   - Using the promotion where every second yogurt is bought at the reduced price \( b \). This involves buying pairs of yogurts, so the number of pairs is \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) and the remaining yogurts are \( n \mod 2 \). Thus, the cost is \( d = b \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + a \times (n \mod 2) + a \times \left( n - \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \times 2 \right) \).
5. It then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The logic in the program accurately follows the problem statement. For each test case, it calculates the cost using both the regular and promotional methods and outputs the minimum value. Therefore, the program should be correct according to the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
