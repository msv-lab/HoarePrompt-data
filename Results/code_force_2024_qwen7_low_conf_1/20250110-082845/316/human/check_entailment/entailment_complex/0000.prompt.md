You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            c = a * n
            d = b + (n - 2) * a
            e = min(c, d)
        
        print(e)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is not defined, `d` is not defined, `e` is not defined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `n` is 1, it sets `e` to `a`. Otherwise, it calculates two values `c` and `d`, where `c` is `a * n` and `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, and then sets `e` to the minimum of `c` and `d`. After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `e` for each test case.
