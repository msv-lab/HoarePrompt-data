Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly initializes the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic for calculating the minimum cost (`e`) is correct:
   - If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a` (since you're buying one yogurt).
   - Otherwise, it calculates two potential costs:
     - `c`: The cost if each yogurt is bought individually, which is `a * n`.
     - `d`: The cost if `n-1` yogurts are bought at the regular price and 1 yogurt at the promotion price, which is `b + (n - 2) * a`.
   - It then sets `e` to the minimum of `c` and `d`.
4. The program correctly prints the result for each test case.
5. The state of variables after the for loop is consistent with the program's execution: `t` is decremented to 0, and local variables within the loop (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`) are redefined for each iteration.

Given the above points, the annotated program accurately reflects the intended logic and will produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
