Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summary.

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
3. If \( n = 1 \), the cost is set to \( a \), which is correct.
4. For \( n > 1 \), the program calculates two possible costs:
   - \( c = a \times n \): This represents the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - \( d = b + (n - 2) \times a \): This formula seems to have an issue. The correct formula for the promotional cost should be:
     \[
     d = b \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + a \times (n \mod 2)
     \]
     This formula accounts for the fact that every second yogurt is bought at the reduced price \( b \), and any remaining yogurts (if \( n \) is odd) are bought at the regular price \( a \).

Given the provided example and the function summary, let's verify the correct promotional cost calculation:

- In the third test case (3, 5, 11):
  - Regular cost: \( c = 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
  - Promotional cost: \( d = 11 + (3 - 2) \times 5 = 11 + 5 = 16 \)
  - The minimum cost should be 15, not 16.

- In the fourth test case (4, 5, 11):
  - Regular cost: \( c = 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
  - Promotional cost: \( d = 11 + (4 - 2) \times 5 = 11 + 10 = 21 \)
  - The minimum cost should be 20, not 21.

The program's current implementation does not correctly calculate the promotional cost. Specifically, the term \( (n - 2) \times a \) is incorrect. The correct formula should be \( b \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + a \times (n \mod 2) \).

Final: **False**
