Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal way to buy \( n \) yogurts under the promotion conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Promotion Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates the total cost without properly considering the promotion. It does not account for the fact that when buying two yogurts, Maxim might get them for \( b \) burles instead of \( 2a \). The variable `d` is calculated as \( b + (n - 2) \times a \), which incorrectly assumes that the second yogurt is always bought individually after a pair is bought at the promotional rate. 

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program fails to consider the most cost-effective way to buy the remaining yogurts after applying the promotion. For instance, in the third example provided (`3 5 11`), the correct solution is to buy three yogurts for 15 burles, which is cheaper than buying two at 11 burles and one at 5 burles.

3. **Logic for Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program processes each test case independently, but it should handle multiple test cases efficiently. However, the current logic is correct for individual test cases but fails to generalize the optimal strategy across different scenarios.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program that implements the correct logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the cost without promotion
        no_promo_cost = a * n
        
        # Calculate the cost with promotion
        promo_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(no_promo_cost, promo_cost))

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **no_promo_cost**: This calculates the total cost if each yogurt is bought individually.
- **promo_cost**: This calculates the total cost if the maximum number of pairs is bought under the promotion, followed by buying the remaining individual yogurts at the regular price.
- **print(min(no_promo_cost, promo_cost))**: This prints the minimum of the two costs, ensuring Maxim spends the least amount of burles.

This corrected program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all possible values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
