Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input, reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case.
2. For each test case, the program calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the given prices `a` (regular price for one yogurt) and `b` (promotion price for two yogurts).
3. If `n` is 1, the program correctly sets `e` to `a`, which is the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price.
4. For `n > 1`, the program calculates:
   - `c` as `a * n`, which is the total cost without any promotions.
   - `d` as `b + (n - 2) * a`, which accounts for the cost of buying `n-2` additional yogurts at the regular price after the initial pair bought at the promotion price.
5. The program then sets `e` to the minimum of `c` and `d`, ensuring that Maxim spends the least amount of money.
6. Finally, the program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts with the given promotion.

Correctness: **True**
