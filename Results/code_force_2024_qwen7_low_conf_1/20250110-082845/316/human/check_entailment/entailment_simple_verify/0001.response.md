### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying \( n \) yogurts based on the given conditions.

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Single Yogurt Case:**
   - If \( n = 1 \), the cost is correctly set to \( a \), which is the price of a single yogurt.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Case:**
   - If \( n > 1 \), the program calculates the cost in two ways:
     - **Regular Price:** \( c = a \times n \). This represents buying all \( n \) yogurts at the regular price.
     - **Promotional Price:** 
       - The program calculates the cost as \( d = b + (n - 2) \times a \). However, this formula is incorrect.
       - The correct formula should be \( d = b \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + a \times (n \mod 2) + a \times \left( n - 2 \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \right) \).

   - Let's break down the correct formula:
     - \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \) gives the number of full pairs of yogurts.
     - \( n \mod 2 \) gives the number of remaining yogurts after forming full pairs.
     - The cost for the remaining yogurts is \( a \times (n \mod 2) \).
     - The cost for the remaining yogurts that need to be paired is \( a \times (n - 2 \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor) \).

4. **Minimizing Cost:**
   - The program correctly finds the minimum cost between the regular price and the promotional price and prints it.

### Detailed Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided:

#### Test Case 1: \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
- Regular price: \( c = 5 \times 2 = 10 \)
- Promotional price: \( d = 9 + (2 - 2) \times 5 = 9 \)
- Minimum cost: \( \min(10, 9) = 9 \)

#### Test Case 2: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
- Regular price: \( c = 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
- Promotional price: \( d = 9 + (3 - 2) \times 5 + 5 = 9 + 5 + 5 = 19 \)
- Minimum cost: \( \min(15, 19) = 15 \)

#### Test Case 3: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
- Regular price: \( c = 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
- Promotional price: \( d = 11 + (3 - 2) \times 5 + 5 = 11 + 5 + 5 = 21 \)
- Minimum cost: \( \min(15, 21) = 15 \)

#### Test Case 4: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
- Regular price: \( c = 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Promotional price: \( d = 11 + (4 - 2) \times 5 + 5 = 11 + 10 + 5 = 26 \)
- Minimum cost: \( \min(20, 26) = 20 \)

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly calculates the promotional price. The formula used in the program does not account for the remaining yogurts correctly when \( n \) is odd. The original assessment did not catch this mistake, leading to an inaccurate conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
