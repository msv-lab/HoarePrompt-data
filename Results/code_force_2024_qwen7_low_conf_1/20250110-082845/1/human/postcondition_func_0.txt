The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then categorizes these integers into three groups based on their occurrences: `g0` for integers appearing 0 times, `g1` for integers appearing 1 time, and `g2` for integers appearing more than 1 time. Finally, it generates an output string for each group and prints it. Specifically, it ensures that the number of elements printed from each group does not exceed `k` while maintaining the required format.
