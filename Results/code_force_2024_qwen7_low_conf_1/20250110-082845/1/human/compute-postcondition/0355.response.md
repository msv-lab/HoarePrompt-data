The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop structure present in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is `current_wanted_singles + 1`; `wp` is the same as `wanted_pairs`. If `wanted_singles` is greater than `singles`, then `ws` is updated to `singles + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
