The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them by whitespace, then converts them to integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` is not affected, as it was set in a previous input that is not changed here.

Since the initial state of `t` is an integer entered by the user such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, this condition remains true after the code is executed. The values of `n` and `k` are newly assigned based on the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer entered by the user such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer entered by the user; `k` is an integer entered by the user**
