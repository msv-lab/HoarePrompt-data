Postcondition: ***`output` is a list containing two elements: `'x x'` and `f'{x} {x}'`, `total` is 0, `i` is still `n + 1`, `n` is still an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is still a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is still a list of `n + 1` integers, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` remain unchanged in terms of their structure but will have one less element after the loop processes one element, `v` is `v + 6` if `v < k`. Otherwise, the state remains as `output` is a list containing one element `'x x'`, `total` is 0, `i` is still `n + 1`, `n` is still an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is still a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is still a list of `n + 1` integers, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` remain unchanged in terms of their structure but will have one less element after the loop processes one element, `v` is `v + 4`.***
