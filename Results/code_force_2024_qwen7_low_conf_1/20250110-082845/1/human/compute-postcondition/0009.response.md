The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1. Given the initial state, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `occ[x]` is 1 and all other elements are 0. After incrementing `occ[x]`, the value of `occ[x]` will be 2. All other elements in the `occ` list remain unchanged and are still 0.

The states of other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer >= 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is twice its original value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the first element), `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `occ[x]` is 2 and all other elements are 0.**
