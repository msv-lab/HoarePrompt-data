`singles` is incremented by 1. The initial state tells us that `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair, but this dictionary is not directly affected by the given line of code. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `singles`.

Output State: **`cnts` must have at least one key-value pair; `singles` is increased by 1**
