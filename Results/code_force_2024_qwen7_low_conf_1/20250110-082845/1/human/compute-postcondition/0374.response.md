`res1` is appended with the value of `ai`. The value of `ai` is 1 because `cnts[ai]` was previously 1 (meaning `ai` was a key in `cnts` with a count of 1). The value of `hs` is incremented by 1, and the value of `cnts[ai]` is now 0 since it was 1 and we just appended `ai` to `res1`, reducing its count.

Output State: **`cnts[ai]` is 0, `hs` is incremented by 1, `res1` contains `ai`, `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`.**
