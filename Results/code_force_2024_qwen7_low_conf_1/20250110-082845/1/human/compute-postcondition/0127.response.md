Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `occ[i]` is 0, then `g0` contains `[1, i + 1]`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, and `i + 1` is 2. If `occ[i]` is 1, then `g0` contains `1`, `g1` is `[i + 1]` or `[1, i + 1]`, `g2` is `[1]` or an empty list, and `i + 1` is 2. Otherwise, `g0` contains `1`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is a list containing `[1, i + 1]` or just `[i + 1]`, and `i + 1` is 2.**
