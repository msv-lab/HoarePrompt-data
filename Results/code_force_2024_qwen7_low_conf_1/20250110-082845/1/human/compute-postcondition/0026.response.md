The code `g1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `g1`. This changes the list `g1` to include the value 2.

- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains an integer and `n >= 1`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The list `occ` remains unchanged.
- If `occ[2]` was 0, then `g0` contains the element 1.
- If `occ[2]` was 1, then either `g1` or `g2` contains the element 1.

After the code executes, the list `g1` now includes the value 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `g1` is `[2]` if `occ[2]` was 0, otherwise `g1` still contains the element 1 and now also contains the element 2.**
