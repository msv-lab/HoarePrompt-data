According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop runs for `t` iterations, and since `t` is an integer entered by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1.

Before the loop starts, we know:
- `t` is the integer entered by the user.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since the problem specifies that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), we only need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer entered by the user such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
