Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial state**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. Therefore, the loop can only execute if `a` is a non-empty list.

2. **List `a` and its elements**: The list `a` is based on user input, but we don't know the exact content of `a` from the given information. However, we do know that the loop body will access elements of `a`, so `a` must be a non-empty list.

3. **Other variables**:
   - `t` is an integer entered by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `k` is twice its original value, so it needs to be adjusted to reflect this change.
   - `a` is a list of integers based on user input.
   - `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not run.

Given these points, let's formulate the required states:

- `t` is an integer entered by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer entered by the user.
- `k` is twice its original value, so it needs to be adjusted.
- `a` is a list of integers based on user input, and it must contain at least one element.
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`t` is an integer >= 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is twice its original value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**
