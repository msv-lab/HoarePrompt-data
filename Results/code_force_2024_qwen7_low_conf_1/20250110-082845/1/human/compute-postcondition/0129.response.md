`g0.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g0`. Since `i` is defined as `i + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`, the value of `i` is `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1` and is now appended to `g0`.**
