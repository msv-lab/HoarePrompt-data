`v` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `v` is less than `k`, so after incrementing, `v` is now `v + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists that contain elements based on the value of `occ[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `v` is `v + 2`, and `output` is a list containing `f'{x} {x}'`.**
