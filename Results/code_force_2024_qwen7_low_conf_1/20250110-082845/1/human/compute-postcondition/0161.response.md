`output` is a list containing the formatted string of `x`. The code appends the formatted string of `x` to the list `output`. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, but it is formatted into a string and added to the list. The other variables `g1` and `v` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is either `v + 1` if `v < k`, `output` is a list containing the formatted string of `x` and the string formatted from `x` appended to it.**
