Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` must be greater than 0. If `occ[i]` is 0, `g0` contains `1`, `g1` is an empty list, and `g2` is an empty list. If `occ[i]` is 1, `g1` is `[1]` or an empty list, `g2` is `[1]` or an empty list, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `g1` and `g2` are either `[1]` or empty lists, and `i` is 2.***
