Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`, `ai` is the next element in `half`, `hs` is increased by 2, `res1` contains the appended value of `ai` appended with `ai`, and `res2` contains the value `res2.append(ai)` appended with `ai`. This holds true if `cnts[ai] == 1`. If `cnts[ai] != 1`, the values of `cnts`, `ai`, `hs`, `res1`, and `res2` remain unchanged.***
