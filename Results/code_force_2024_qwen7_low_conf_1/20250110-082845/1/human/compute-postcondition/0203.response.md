The code snippet `occ[x] += 1` increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `occ`. Assuming `occ` is a dictionary that maps elements from the list `a` to their occurrences (which is a reasonable assumption given the context), the code will increment the count of the element `x` in `occ`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a` or `occ`, let's consider the general case where `occ` is a dictionary that tracks the occurrences of elements in `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers; `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the number of times that element appears in `a`, and the count of `x` in `occ` is increased by 1.**
