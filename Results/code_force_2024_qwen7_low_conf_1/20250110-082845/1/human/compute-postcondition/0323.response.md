The variable `ws` is assigned the value `0`, while the values of the other variables (`cnts`, `singles`, `pairs`, and `found`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` must be a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`. `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, and `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is False; `ws` is 0**
