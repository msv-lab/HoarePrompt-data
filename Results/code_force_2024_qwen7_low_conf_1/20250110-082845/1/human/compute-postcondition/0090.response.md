The code snippet appends a formatted string containing the value of `x` to the `output` list. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `x`. Therefore, the only change is the addition of a new element to the `output` list.

Output State: **`v` is an integer, `output` is a list with one additional element `'x'`, and `g1` is a non-empty iterable.**
