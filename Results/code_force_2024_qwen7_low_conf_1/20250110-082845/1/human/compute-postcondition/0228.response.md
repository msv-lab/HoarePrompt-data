The code snippet `g1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g1`. From the initial state, `i` is equal to \( k + 1 \). Therefore, `g1` will now contain `[i]`, which is `[k + 1]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise, `g1` is a list containing `[i + 1]` (which is `[k + 1]`), and `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is not 1. `i` is \( k + 1 \), and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
