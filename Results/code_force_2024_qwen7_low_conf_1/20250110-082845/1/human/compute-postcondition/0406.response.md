`res1.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res1`. The initial state mentions that `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary and `hp` is increased by 1, and there's a condition to break out of a loop if `hp` equals `wp`. However, the code snippet does not involve these variables directly. Thus, they remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is increased by 1, res1 is a list with an additional element `ai` appended to it.**
