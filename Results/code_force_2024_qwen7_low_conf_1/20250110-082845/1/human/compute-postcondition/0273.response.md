The code `v += 2` increments the value of `v` by 2. Given that `v` is less than `k` in the initial state, after executing this line, `v` will be `v + 2`. The states of `g1` and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element, `v` is equal to its initial value plus 2, and `k` is greater than `v`.**
