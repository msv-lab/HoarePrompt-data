The code snippet `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` adds a new element to the `output` list, which is a formatted string `f'{x} {x}'`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `x`. Since the value of `x` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact string that will be added to the `output` list. The only thing we know is that `x` is not defined in the initial state.

Given the initial state, we can conclude that the value of `x` remains undefined, and the `output` list is modified by appending a new string `f'{x} {x}'`.

Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v == v_prev + 4` and `v < k`, `k` is an integer, `output` is either `[v + 10, f'{v + 10} {v + 10}']` or the original values depending on the condition, and `output` is now appended with `f'{x} {x}'`.**
