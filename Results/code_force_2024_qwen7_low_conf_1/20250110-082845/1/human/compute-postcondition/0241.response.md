The code appends a formatted string to the `output` list. Given that `output` initially contains the string `'x x'`, appending `f'{x} {x}'` will add this new string to the list.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `x`, we know that `output` will contain two elements: `'x x'` and `f'{x} {x}'`.

Output State: **`g2` is not empty, `v` is less than `k` by 2, and `output` contains the strings 'x x' and f'{x} {x}'**
