The code snippet `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a formatted string consisting of `x` repeated twice to the list `output`. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact content of the appended string. The only thing we know for certain is that `x` is less than `k` and `v` is less than `k`.

Given this, the output state will be:
- `output` is now a list containing one element, which is the string `f'{x} {x}'`.
- `g1` is unchanged and is still an iterable containing at least one element.
- `v` is unchanged and is still less than `k`.
- `output` is no longer an empty list but contains the new element.

Output State: **`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element, `v` is less than `k`, `output` is ['{x} {x}'], `x` is less than `k`**
