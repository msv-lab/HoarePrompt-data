The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since the provided code does not specify which loop it belongs to, the variables listed in the initial state will not be altered by this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is equal to `prev_wanted_singles + 1`; `wp` is equal to `(k - (prev_wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`; `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - (prev_wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`. If `wanted_singles > singles`, then nothing changes. Since there is no else part, the conditions and values remain as they are after the if statement executes.**
