The variable `v` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The initial values of `a`, `occ`, `g0`, `g1`, `g2`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 0 times in `a`, `g1` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 1 time in `a`, `g2` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` that appear more than 1 time in `a`, `n` is the highest integer in the list `a`, and `v` is 0.**
