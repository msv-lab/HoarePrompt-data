Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the number of times that element appears in `a`.
   - The count of the next `x` in `occ` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `a`.

3. **Modification in Loop Body**: 
   - For each `x` in `a`, the count of `x` in `occ` is increased by 1.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` remains a non-empty list of integers.
   - `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the updated number of times that element appears in `a`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - To proceed to the next iteration, the loop needs to consider the next element in `a`.
   - The count of the next `x` in `occ` will be increased by 1 in the next iteration.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `a` remains the same as it is a non-empty list of integers.
- `occ` is updated such that the count of the next `x` in `occ` will be increased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the updated number of times that element appears in `a`, and the count of the next `x` in `occ` is increased by 1**.
