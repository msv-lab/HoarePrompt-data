`g1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g1`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `g1` or `i`, but it implies that `g1` is a list and `i` is a variable. After executing this line of code, the value of `i` is added to `g1`.

Output State: **`i` is updated such that its value is appended to the list `g1`, and `g1` is a list containing its original elements plus the new element `i`.**
