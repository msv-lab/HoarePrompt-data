`res1.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res1`. Since `res1` originally contained `ai`, after appending `ai` again, `res1` will now contain `ai, ai`. The other variables (`cnts`, `hp`, `wp`, `cnt`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` equals `wp + 1`, `wp` equals `hp - 1`, `cnt` equals 2, `res1` contains `ai, ai`**
