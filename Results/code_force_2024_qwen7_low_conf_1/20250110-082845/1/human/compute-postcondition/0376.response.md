Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`. If `cnts[ai]` is 1, `hs` is incremented by 1 and `res1` contains `ai`. Otherwise, `res2` contains `ai`.***

Explanation:
- The if part states that if `cnts[ai]` is 0, then `hs` is incremented by 1, `res1` contains `ai`, and `cnts` remains unchanged.
- Since `cnts[ai]` being 0 is a specific case and does not apply here, we focus on the general case where `cnts[ai]` is 1.
- When `cnts[ai]` is 1, `hs` is incremented by 1, `res1` contains `ai`, and `cnts` remains unchanged.
- The else part is not provided, implying that if `cnts[ai]` is not 1, then `res2` contains `ai` and `cnts` remains unchanged.

Thus, the overall postcondition combines both scenarios while maintaining the integrity of the dictionary and the relevant updates to `hs` and the result lists.
