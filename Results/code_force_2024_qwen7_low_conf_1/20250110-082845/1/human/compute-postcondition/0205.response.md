The code increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `occ`. Since `x` is a key in `occ`, its corresponding value (which represents the count) is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the number of times that element appears in `a`, and the count of the next `x` in `occ` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the number of times that element appears in `a`, and the count of the next `x` in `occ` is increased by 1.**
