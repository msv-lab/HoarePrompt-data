The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋.
- Additionally, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

Based on the provided output cases, the function processes these parameters and returns different values depending on the test case conditions. However, since no specific return values are detailed in the provided output, we can only describe the input parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the specified parameters and process them according to the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers.**
