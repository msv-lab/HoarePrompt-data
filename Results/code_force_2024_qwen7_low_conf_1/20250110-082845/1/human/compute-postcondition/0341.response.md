The `continue` statement in the code does not change any variable values or affect the current iteration of a loop. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one. Since no changes are made to the variables `cnts`, `singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `ws`, `wp`, or `wanted_pairs`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is equal to `prev_wanted_singles + 1`; `wp` is equal to `(k - (prev_wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`; `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - (prev_wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`**
