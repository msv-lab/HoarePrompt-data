The code `g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. Given the precondition, `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is not 1. Since `occ[j]` is not equal to 0 if `j` is not `i + 1`, `occ[i + 1]` cannot be 0 (because if it were, `g2` would be an empty list and `occ[i + 1]` would not be 1). Therefore, `occ[i + 1]` must be something other than 0 and 1, meaning `g2` will now contain the key `i + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise, `g1` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and may contain `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 1, `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is not 1, `g2` now contains the key `i + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
