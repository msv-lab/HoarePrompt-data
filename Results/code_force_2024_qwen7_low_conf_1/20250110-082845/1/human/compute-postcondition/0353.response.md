The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. It does not affect the values of any variables. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is `current_wanted_singles + 1`; `wp` is the same as `wanted_pairs`.**
