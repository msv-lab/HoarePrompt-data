Postcondition: ***`v` is an integer. If `v` is an odd number and less than `k`, `output` includes the current value of `x` as a string. Since `g1` must now contain at least one element (as the first element was removed), the postcondition remains that `g1` contains at least one element. If `v` is not an odd number or is not less than `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition: `v` is either its original value (0) or an even number, `output` contains all pairs `{x} {x}` where `x` is an element from `g0` until `v` reaches `k`, or `{a}` where `a` is the first element of `g0` if `v` is an odd number less than `k`, and `g1` contains at least one element.***
