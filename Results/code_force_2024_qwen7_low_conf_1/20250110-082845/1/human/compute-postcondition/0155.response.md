Postcondition: ***`g1` must contain at least one element, `g2` must contain elements that satisfy the condition `v < k`. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `k-1`, and `output` contains the formatted string of `x`. Since there is no else part, the conditions for the if part directly apply to the postcondition.***
