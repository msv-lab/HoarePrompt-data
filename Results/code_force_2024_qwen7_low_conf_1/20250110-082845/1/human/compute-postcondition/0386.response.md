Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`, `ai` is the next element in `half` (the next key in `cnts` with a non-zero count), `hs` is increased by 1, `res1` contains the appended value of `ai`, and `res2` contains the appended value of `ai`. If `hs == ws`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing changes.***
