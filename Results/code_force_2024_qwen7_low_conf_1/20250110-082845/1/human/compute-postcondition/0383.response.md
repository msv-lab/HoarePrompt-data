Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`. If `cnts[ai] == 1`, then `res1` contains the appended value of `ai`, `ai` is the next element in `half`, `hs` is increased by 1, and `res2` contains the appended value of `ai`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `res1` and `res2` containing their original values.***
