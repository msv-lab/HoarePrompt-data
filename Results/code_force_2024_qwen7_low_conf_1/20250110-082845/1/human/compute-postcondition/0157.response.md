The code appends the formatted string of `x` to the list `output`. The previous value of `output` is a list containing a formatted string of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `output` is a list with an additional element, which is the formatted string of `x`.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` must be an element in `g1` and must be less than or equal to `k-1`, `output` is a list containing the formatted string of `x`.**
