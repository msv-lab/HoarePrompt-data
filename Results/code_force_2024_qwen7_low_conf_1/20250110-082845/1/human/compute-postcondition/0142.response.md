Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `v` is `v + 2` (meaning `v` has increased by 2 from its previous value).
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `v` is less than `k`.
   - `output` is a list with one element, which is a string `f'{x} {x}'`.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for x in g2:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the iterable `g2`.
   - Each iteration increments the variable `x`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `v < k` must still hold true.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `v` was incremented by 2 in the previous iteration (from `v + 2`), we need to consider how `v` changes in the current iteration.
   - If `x` is the next element in `g2`, then `v` will again increase by 2.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `v` must remain less than `k` even after it increases by 2.

6. **New State**:
   - `v` will be `v + 4` (since it increased by 2 in the previous iteration and will increase by 2 again).
   - `k` remains an integer.
   - `v` must still be less than `k`.
   - `output` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted and does not affect `output`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `v` is `v + 4`, `k` is an integer, `v` must be less than `k`, and `output` is a list with one element which is a string `f'{x} {x}'`**.
