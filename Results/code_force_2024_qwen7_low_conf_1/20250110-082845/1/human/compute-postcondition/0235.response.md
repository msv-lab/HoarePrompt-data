According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `g2`. The loop will execute if there are elements in `g2`. Before the loop starts, we know the following:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`.
- `g2` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` that appear more than 1 time in `a`.

For the loop to execute, `g2` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `g2` is non-empty.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over `g2`.
2. For the loop to execute, `g2` must not be empty.

Given the current state where `a`, `occ`, `g0`, `g1`, `g2`, `n`, and `v` are defined as specified, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is to ensure `g2` is non-empty.

State: **`g2` must not be empty**
