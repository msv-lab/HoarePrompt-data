Postcondition: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`. `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, and `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is False; `ws` is 0; `wp` is 0; `wanted_pairs` is `(k - wanted_singles) // 2; `wanted_pairs` remains unchanged, and the current value of `wanted_pairs` is greater than `pairs`**
