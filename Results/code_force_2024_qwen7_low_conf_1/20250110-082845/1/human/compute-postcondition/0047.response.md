Postcondition: **`output` is a list containing one more element `'x x'`, `total` is still 0, `i` is still `n + 1`, `n` is still an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is still a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is still a list of `n + 1` integers, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` remain unchanged in terms of their structure but will have one less element after the loop processes one element, `v` is now `v + 4`**
