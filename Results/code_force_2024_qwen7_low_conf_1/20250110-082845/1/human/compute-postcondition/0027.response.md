`g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `g2`. Since `i` is initially 2, the list `g2` will now contain `[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, and `g2` is a list containing `[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `g2` is a list containing `[2]`**.
