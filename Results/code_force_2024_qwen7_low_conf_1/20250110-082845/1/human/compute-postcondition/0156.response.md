According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `g1`. For the loop to continue executing, `g1` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `g1` must contain at least one element.
- The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `k-1`.
- `output` contains the formatted string of `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `g1` must still contain at least one element, and the loop will process the next element from `g1`. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `g1` must contain at least one element (unchanged).
- `v` will be updated to the next element in `g1` and must still be less than or equal to `k-1`.
- `output` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` must be an element in `g1` and must be less than or equal to `k-1`, and `output` contains the formatted string of `x`**.
