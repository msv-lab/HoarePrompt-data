The code snippet appends a formatted string `f'{x}'` to the `output` list. The initial state specifies that `output` has an additional element `f'{x}'`, which means before the code execution, `output` already contains this element. After appending `f'{x}'` to `output`, the `output` list will have two elements, both being `f'{x}'`.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus 1, and the `output` list has two elements, both equal to `f'{x}'`.**
