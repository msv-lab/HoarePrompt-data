The code `g1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g1`. Given the initial state, the following updates occur:

- `g1` is a list, and now it includes the value of `i` appended to it.
- `i` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `n + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `g1` is now a list containing the elements of its original contents plus the value of `i` (which was originally `i + 1`).
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `k` retains its original value.
- `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is now less than `n + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1` and is less than `n + 1`; `g1` is a list containing its original contents plus the value of `i` (which was originally `i + 1`).**
