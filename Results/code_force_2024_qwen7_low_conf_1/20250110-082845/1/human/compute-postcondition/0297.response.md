Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then categorizes these integers into three groups based on their occurrences: `g0` for integers appearing 0 times, `g1` for integers appearing 1 time, and `g2` for integers appearing more than 1 time. Finally, it generates an output string for each group and prints it. Specifically, it ensures that the number of elements printed from each group does not exceed `k` while maintaining the required format.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `k` is set to 0, no elements would be printed from any group.
- If `k` is greater than the total number of unique elements in the list `a`, the function would still ensure not to exceed the count of unique elements.
- If the list `a` contains duplicate integers not following the pattern (i.e., integers from 1 to n appear exactly twice), the function may produce incorrect results. However, the code assumes the input is valid and correctly structured.

After the function concludes, the program will have processed all test cases and printed the output strings for each test case.
