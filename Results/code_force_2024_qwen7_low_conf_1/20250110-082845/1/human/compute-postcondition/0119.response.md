`g2` is appended with the value `i`. The value of `i` is 1 according to the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is now `[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `occ[1]` is not equal to 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is `[1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `occ[1]` is not equal to 1.**
