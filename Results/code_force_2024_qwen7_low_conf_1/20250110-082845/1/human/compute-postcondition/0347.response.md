Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; if `wanted_pairs` is greater than `pairs`, the program continues to execute as specified in the if part without changing the values of `ws`, `wp`, and `wanted_pairs`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ws`, `wp`, and `wanted_pairs`.***
