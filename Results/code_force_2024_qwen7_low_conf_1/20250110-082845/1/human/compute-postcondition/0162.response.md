`v` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `v` before the increment is not specified. However, we know that `g1` must contain at least one element and `v` was either `v + 1` if `v < k`, or `output` was a list containing the formatted string of `x` and the string formatted from `x` appended to it. Since the exact initial value of `v` is not given, we only update `v` and keep the other conditions intact.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is `v + 1`, `output` is a list containing the formatted string of `x` and the string formatted from `x` appended to it.**
