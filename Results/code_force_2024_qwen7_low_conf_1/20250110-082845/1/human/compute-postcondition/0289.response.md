According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `g1`. For the loop to execute, `g1` must have at least one element. At the end of the last iteration:

- `g1` must have at least one element.
- If `v < k`, then `output` is a list containing the strings `'x'` and `'2'`, and `v` is 3.
- Since there is no else part, no other changes occur if the condition `v < k` is not met.

For the loop to execute one more time, `g1` must still have at least one element. The value of `v` remains 3, and `output` remains a list containing the strings `'x'` and `'2'`.

State: **`g1` must have at least one element, `v` is 3, `output` is a list containing the strings `'x'` and `'2'`**
