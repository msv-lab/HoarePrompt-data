Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`. `g0` is a list containing `k + 1` if `occ[k + 1]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise. `g1` is a list containing `[k + 1]` if `occ[k + 1]` is 1, and an empty list otherwise. `g2` is an empty list if `occ[k + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `k + 1` if `occ[k + 1]` is not 1. `i` is \( k + 1 \), and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts of the if-else block. It ensures that all possible outcomes are accounted for based on the conditions provided.
