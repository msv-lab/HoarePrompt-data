Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` is the length of the list `a`. After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `g0` contains all the integers `i` for which `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` contains all the integers `i` for which `occ[i] == 1`, and `g2` contains all the integers `i` for which `occ[i] > 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each integer `i` from `1` to `n`.
- For each `i`, based on the value of `occ[i]`, the integer `i` is appended to the corresponding list `g0`, `g1`, or `g2`.
- Since the loop runs for each integer `i` from `1` to `n`, all integers `i` from `1` to `n` are considered.
- If `occ[i] == 0`, `i` is added to `g0`.
- If `occ[i] == 1`, `i` is added to `g1`.
- If `occ[i] > 1`, `i` is added to `g2`.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, `g0` contains all integers `i` for which `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` contains all integers `i` for which `occ[i] == 1`, and `g2` contains all integers `i` for which `occ[i] > 1`.
