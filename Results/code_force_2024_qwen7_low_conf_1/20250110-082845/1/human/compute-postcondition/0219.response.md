Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`. `g0` is a list containing `i` if `occ[i]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise. `g1` is an empty list if `occ[i]` is 0, and may contain `i` if `occ[i]` is 1. `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i]` is 0, and contains the key `i` if `occ[i]` is not 1. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For every key `j` in `occ`, `occ[j]` is not equal to 0 if `j` is not `i`.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of all relevant variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts and their respective conditions.
