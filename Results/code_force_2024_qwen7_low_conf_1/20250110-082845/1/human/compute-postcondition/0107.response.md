The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1. Given the initial state where `a` is a non-empty list and `occ[x]` will be incremented again for the next element in `a`, the impact of this code is to increment `occ[x]` by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list; `occ[x]` is incremented by 1**
