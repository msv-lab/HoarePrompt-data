The code `pairs += 1` increments the value of `pairs` by 1. Since `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair, the initial state of `cnts` does not get directly affected by this line of code. The only change is in the variable `pairs`, which is now incremented by 1.

Output State: **`cnts` must have at least one key-value pair; `pairs` is incremented by 1**
