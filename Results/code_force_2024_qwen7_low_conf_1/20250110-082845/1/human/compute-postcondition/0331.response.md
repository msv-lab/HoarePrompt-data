Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`. `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, and `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is False; `ws` is 0; `wp` is 0; if the condition `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` holds true, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change based on the else case.***
