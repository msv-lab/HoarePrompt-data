`output` appends the value of `f'{x}'` to itself. Given that `x` is 2, `f'{x}'` evaluates to `'2'`. Therefore, the `output` list will now contain the string `'x'` and `'2'`.

Output State: **`g1` must have at least one element, `output` is a list containing the strings `'x'` and `'2'`, and `v` is 2.**
