Postcondition: ***`v` is an integer, `output` is a list, and `g1` is a non-empty iterable. If `v < k`, then `v` is incremented by 1, `output` has one additional element 'x', and `g1` remains unchanged. If `v` is not less than `k`, the values of `v`, `output`, and `g1` remain as they were before the if-else block.***
