`v` is incremented by 1, which means the new value of `v` is the original value of `v` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is `v` + 1 (where `v` is an element in `g1` and was less than or equal to `k-1`), `output` is a list containing the formatted string of `x`.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is `v` + 1, `output` is a list containing the formatted string of `x`.**
