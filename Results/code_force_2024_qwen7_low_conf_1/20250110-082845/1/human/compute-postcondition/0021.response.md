`g2` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, `n` remains an integer and is greater than or equal to 1, `a` remains a non-empty list of integers, and `occ` remains a list of `n + 1` integers with `occ[i]` not equal to 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, and `occ[i]` is not equal to 1; `g2` contains the element 1**
