The code `wanted_pairs = k - wanted_singles >> 1` calculates `wanted_pairs` by performing a right shift operation on `k - wanted_singles` by 1 bit. This means `wanted_pairs` is equivalent to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`.

- `k` and `wanted_singles` remain unchanged.
- `wanted_pairs` is updated to the value of `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`.

The states of other variables (`cnts`, `singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `ws`, `wp`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`. `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, and `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is False; `ws` is 0; `wp` is 0; `wanted_pairs` is `(k - wanted_singles) // 2; (k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` remains unchanged.**
