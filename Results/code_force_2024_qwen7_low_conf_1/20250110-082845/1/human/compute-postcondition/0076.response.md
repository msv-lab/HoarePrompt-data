The code snippet appends a formatted string to the list `output`. Initially, `output` is `['x x']`. The string being appended is `'x x'` formatted, which remains `'x x'`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the list `output` will have two elements: the original `'x x'` and the newly added `'x x'`.

Output State: **`output` is `['x x', 'x x']`, `v` must be less than `k`, `g0` is an iterable with at least one element**
