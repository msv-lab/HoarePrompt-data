The code appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `g0`. Since `i` is initially 2, appending it to `g0` means `g0` now contains the element 2.

- The value of `i` remains unchanged as 2.
- `n` and `a` remain unaffected.
- The value of `occ` also remains unchanged since the code does not modify it.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `g0` is a list containing the element 2.**
