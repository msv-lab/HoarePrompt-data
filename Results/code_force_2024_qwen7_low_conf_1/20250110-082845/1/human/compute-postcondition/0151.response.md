Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information
- `v` is an integer such that \( v = v_{\text{original}} + 2 \times (\text{number\_of\_iterations}) \).
- `k` is an integer.
- `output` is a list containing strings of the form `f'{x} {x}'` where `x` is an element of `g2` and the total number of such strings is equal to the number of elements in `g2` that satisfy the condition `v < k`. If no elements in `g2` satisfy the condition `v < k`, then `output` remains an empty list.
- The loop iterates over `g1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for x in g1:` will execute as long as `g1` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `g1` contains at least one element.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - We know the initial value of `v` is given by \( v = v_{\text{original}} + 2 \times (\text{number\_of\_iterations}) \). This does not directly affect the loop's execution but is relevant to the condition inside the loop.
   - `k` is an integer, and its value is fixed or may vary depending on the context outside the loop.
   - `output` is a list of strings, and its current state is based on the initial conditions. For the loop to modify `output`, we need to consider the condition `v < k` and how many elements in `g2` satisfy this condition.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to guarantee that `g1` is non-empty.
   - The value of `v` and `k` should be such that there are elements in `g2` that satisfy `v < k`, otherwise, `output` would remain an empty list and the loop would not have an impact on `output`.

### Conclusion
To summarize, the key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `g1` must contain at least one element.
- `g2` must contain elements that satisfy the condition `v < k`.

Thus, the final answer is:

**State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `g2` must contain elements that satisfy the condition `v < k`**.
