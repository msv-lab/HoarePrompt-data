The code sets `wp` to the value of `wanted_pairs`. The value of `wanted_pairs` is given as `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`. Therefore, `wp` is also equal to `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, and `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles`; `wp` is `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`; `wanted_pairs` is `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`.**
