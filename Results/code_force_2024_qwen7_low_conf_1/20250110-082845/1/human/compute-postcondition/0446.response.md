Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \), along with an array \( a \) of length \( 2n \) where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice. It then determines two sets of elements, `res1` and `res2`, such that the total number of single occurrences in both sets combined is equal to \( k \), and the total number of pairs in both sets combined is also equal to \( k \). The function ensures that no integer appears more than once in either set. Finally, it prints the elements of `res1` and `res2` for each test case.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If the total number of single occurrences is less than \( k \) or the total number of pairs is less than \( k \), the function will raise an assertion error since it is impossible to satisfy the condition \( k - \text{wanted\_singles} \) being even and greater than the number of pairs available.
- If there are not enough unique integers in the array \( a \) to form the required sets, the function will also raise an assertion error.

Missing Functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where the total number of single occurrences is zero and the required \( k \) is odd. In such a case, it is impossible to form the required sets, and an assertion error would occur. This scenario needs to be handled to prevent the assertion error.
