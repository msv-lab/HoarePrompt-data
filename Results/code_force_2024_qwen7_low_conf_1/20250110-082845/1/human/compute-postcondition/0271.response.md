Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `g1` is an iterable containing at least one element.
   - `v` is incremented by 2.
   - If `v` is less than `k`, `output` is a list containing one element which is a string formatted as `'x x'` where `x` is less than `k`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the conditions given, we need to consider what changes would allow the loop to execute again.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to continue, `v` must be less than `k` because if `v` is not less than `k`, the loop body is not defined (or it ends).

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `v` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute again, `v` must still be less than `k`.
   - `g1` must contain at least one element to ensure there is something to iterate over.
   - The `output` state remains undefined unless `v` is less than `k`, but since we are focusing on the loop condition, we don't need to adjust `output` directly.

4. **New State:**
   - `g1` must contain at least one element.
   - `v` must be less than `k` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the new state should reflect these adjustments:

**State: **`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element, `v` is less than `k`**
