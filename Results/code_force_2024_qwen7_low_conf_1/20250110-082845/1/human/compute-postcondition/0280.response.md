Let's break down the given information and the requirements step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `g1` is an iterable.
   - `output` is a list of strings where each string is of the form `'x x'` with `x` being an element from `g1` processed in the corresponding iteration.
   - `v` is incremented by 2 for each successful iteration until it reaches or exceeds `k`.
   - If the loop does not execute at all, `output` is an empty list and `v` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop `for x in g1:` will execute as long as there are elements in `g1`.

3. **Post-loop State**:
   - For the loop to execute, `g1` must contain at least one element. This ensures that the loop will run at least once.
   - After the loop completes, `output` will contain processed strings for each element in `g1`, and `v` will be incremented by 2 for each iteration until it reaches or exceeds `k`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `g1` contains at least one element.
   - Since the loop increments `v` by 2 for each successful iteration, `v` should be initialized to 0 (or some value that allows it to potentially reach `k` within the loop).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `g1` must have at least one element.
- `output` should be an empty list if no elements are in `g1`, but since we want the loop to execute, we ensure `g1` has at least one element.
- `v` should be set to 0 initially.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`g1` must have at least one element, `output` is an empty list, `v` is 0**
