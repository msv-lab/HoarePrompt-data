Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial Conditions:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list, meaning it contains at least one element.
   - `occ[x]` is incremented by 1 during each iteration of the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Structure:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the State After One Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `occ[x]` has been incremented by 1.
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list, there are still elements left in `a` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `a` remains a non-empty list because we are only iterating through its elements and not modifying `a` itself within the loop.
   - `occ[x]` will be incremented again for the next element in `a`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `a` is still a non-empty list.
   - `occ[x]` will be incremented again for the next element in `a`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `occ[x]` is incremented by 1 again**
