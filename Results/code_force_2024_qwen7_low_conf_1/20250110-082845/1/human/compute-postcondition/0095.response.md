`v` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 2 (since it was an integer incremented by 1 from its previous value). The values of `output` and `g1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `v` is 2; `output` is a list with two elements, the first is `'x'` and the second is the string representation of `x`; `g1` is a non-empty iterable.
