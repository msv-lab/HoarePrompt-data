Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( i \) is 2
   - \( n \) is an integer and \( n \geq 1 \)
   - \( a \) is a non-empty list of integers
   - \( occ \) is a list of \( n + 1 \) integers

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates from 1 to \( n \) (inclusive). Therefore, the condition for the loop to continue is \( i < n + 1 \).

3. **Current Value of \( i \):**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) is 2.

4. **Next Value of \( i \):**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( i \) needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Thus, the new value of \( i \) will be \( 2 + 1 = 3 \).

5. **Condition for Loop Continuation:**
   - The loop continues as long as \( i < n + 1 \).
   - Since \( i \) is now 3, the loop will continue as long as \( 3 < n + 1 \), which simplifies to \( n > 2 \).

6. **Other Variables:**
   - \( n \) remains unchanged, so it must still satisfy \( n \geq 1 \).
   - \( a \) and \( occ \) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- \( i \) must be 3.
- \( n \) must be greater than 2.
- \( a \) remains a non-empty list of integers.
- \( occ \) remains a list of \( n + 1 \) integers.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers**
