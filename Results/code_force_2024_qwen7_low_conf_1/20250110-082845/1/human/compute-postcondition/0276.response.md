The code `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` attempts to append a formatted string to the list `output`. However, there are no variables named `x` in the provided initial state. The only variables mentioned are `g1`, `v`, and `k`. Since `x` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError` when executed. Given this situation, we cannot determine the exact output state because the code will fail to run due to a missing definition for `x`.

Output State: **A `NameError` will occur because `x` is not defined.**
