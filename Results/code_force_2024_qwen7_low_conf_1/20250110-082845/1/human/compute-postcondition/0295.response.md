Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `v` is initialized to 0.
   - `output` is an empty list.
   - `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
   - `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are empty lists.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times.
   - Inside the outer loop, we process `n` and `k` for each `t`.
   - `k` is updated to `2 * k`.
   - We read `n` integers into the list `a`.
   - We populate the `occ` list to count occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - We categorize integers into `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` based on their occurrence counts.
   - For each `x` in `g2`, we append pairs `{x} {x}` to `output` until `v` reaches `k`.
   - For each `x` in `g1`, we append `{x}` to `output` until `v` reaches `k`.
   - For each `x` in `g0`, we append pairs `{x} {x}` to `output` until `v` reaches `k`.
   - After processing, we print the contents of `output`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - Since the outer loop runs `t` times, it processes `t` sets of `n` and `k`.
   - `v` will be at least `k` at the end of each iteration because it increments by at least 1 each time.
   - `output` will contain all the required pairs and single elements as specified by the logic inside the loops.
   - `g1` will be empty by the end of all iterations since all elements in `g1` will be processed and appended to `output`.
   - `g0` and `g2` may still contain elements, but these elements will not be processed further as the loop ends when `v` reaches `k`.

4. **Final Values:**
   - `v` will be at least `k` after all iterations.
   - `output` will contain exactly `k * t` elements as per the logic.
   - `g1` will be an empty list.
   - `g0` and `g2` will contain remaining unprocessed elements, but these do not affect the final `output`.

### Final Output State:
**Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v >= k`, `output` is a list containing exactly `k * t` elements, where each element is either of the form `'x'` or `'x' {x}`, `g1` is an empty list, and `g0` and `g2` are lists of remaining unprocessed elements. If the loop does not execute at all, `v` remains 0, `output` is an empty list, and `g1`, `g0`, and `g2` are as initially populated.**
