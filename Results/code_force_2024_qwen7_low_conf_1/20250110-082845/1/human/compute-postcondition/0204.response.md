Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the number of times that element appears in `a`.
- The count of `x` in `occ` is increased by 1.

### Loop Statement
```
for x in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.
- For each iteration, the count of `x` in the dictionary `occ` is increased by 1.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `occ` is a dictionary mapping elements of `a` to their counts.
   - `x` is an element in `a`, and its count in `occ` is increased by 1.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` remains the same as it was before the loop started (non-empty).
   - `occ` now has the count of the current `x` increased by 1.
   - `x` is the element processed in the last iteration.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `a`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element.

### Updated State
- `a` remains a non-empty list of integers.
- `occ` now includes the updated count of the current `x`.
- `x` will be the next element in `a`.

### Final Answer
State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the number of times that element appears in `a`, and the count of the next `x` in `occ` is increased by 1.**
