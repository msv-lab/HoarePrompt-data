The code snippet `k = 2 * k` multiplies the value of `k` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

- `cnts2` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half`
- `hp` is the total number of elements in `res2` divided by 2
- `res2` contains all elements from `half` that appear exactly twice, each appearing twice
- `wp` is its original value
- `ws` is 0
- `hp` is the total number of elements in `res2` divided by 2
- `hs` is the number of elements in `res2`
- `tc` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is now `2 * k` (the original value of `k` multiplied by 2)
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- the elements of `res2` are printed

Output State: **`cnts2` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half`, `hp` is the total number of elements in `res2` divided by 2, `res2` contains all elements from `half` that appear exactly twice, each appearing twice, `wp` is its original value, `ws` is 0, `hp` is the total number of elements in `res2` divided by 2, `hs` is the number of elements in `res2`, `tc` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 2 * `k`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, the elements of `res2` are printed.**
