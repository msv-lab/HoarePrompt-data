The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal block it is inside. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`, `ai` is the next element in `half` (the next key in `cnts` with a non-zero count), `hs` is increased by 1, `res1` contains the appended value of `ai`, and `res2` contains the appended value of `ai`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
