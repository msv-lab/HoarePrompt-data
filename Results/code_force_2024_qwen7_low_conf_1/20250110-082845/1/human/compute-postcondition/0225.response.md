Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`. `g0` is a list containing `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise. `g1` is a list containing `[i + 1, i]` if `occ[i + 1]` is 1, and an empty list otherwise. `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is not 1. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.***

This summary captures both the conditions of the if and else parts, ensuring that the postcondition reflects the possible states after the execution of the if-else block.
