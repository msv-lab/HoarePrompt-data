`res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the end of the list `res2`. The initial state tells us that `res2` contains four elements, with the first element being its original value, and the second, third, and fourth elements all being `ai`. After appending `ai`, `res2` will now contain five elements, where the fifth element is `ai`.

Output State: **`hp` is 3, `cnts2` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is updated to the count of the next key-value pair, `res2` contains five elements, with the first element being its original value, the second, third, fourth, and fifth elements all being `ai`.**
