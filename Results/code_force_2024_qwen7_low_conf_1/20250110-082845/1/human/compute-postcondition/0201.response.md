The code initializes a list `occ` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. This does not affect the values of `v`, `output`, `g1`, `t`, `n`, `k`, or `a`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `occ`.

- `v` remains either its original value (0) or an even number.
- `output` remains a list containing all pairs `{x} {x}` where `x` is an element from `g0` until `v` reaches `k`.
- `g1` remains empty.
- `t` remains decreased by 1.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `k` remains an input integer multiplied by 2.
- `a` remains a list of integers from the input.
- `occ` is now a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.

Output State: **`v` is either its original value (0) or an even number; `output` is a list containing all pairs `{x} {x}` where `x` is an element from `g0` until `v` reaches `k`; `g1` is empty; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer multiplied by 2; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**
