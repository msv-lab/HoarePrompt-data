To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Loop Analysis:
- **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in `g1`.
- **Incrementation**: For each iteration, if `v < k`, the following actions are performed:
  - `output.append(f'{x}')`: Adds the formatted string of `x` to the `output` list.
  - `v += 1`: Increments `v` by 1.

### Initial Conditions:
- `output` is a list containing `n` elements, each being `'x x'`.
- `total` is 0.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`.
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers.
- `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists that initially contained elements based on the value of `occ[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, but after processing all elements in `g2`, they may be empty.
- `v` is `2n` if `v < k` for all iterations, otherwise `v` is `2m` where `m` is the number of iterations the loop executed.

### Final Iterations:
- The loop continues until `v` no longer satisfies the condition `v < k`.

### Final Output State:
- Since `g1` is iterated over and `output.append(f'{x}')` is performed only if `v < k`, the loop will terminate when `v` is no longer less than `k`.
- After all iterations, `output` will contain the formatted strings of all elements `x` from `g1` (if the loop executes) up to the point where `v` becomes greater than or equal to `k`.
- If `v` was `2n` initially and remains `2n` after the loop, it means the loop did not execute, and `output` remains unchanged.
- If `v` becomes `2m` where `m < n`, then the loop executed `m` times, and `output` contains the formatted strings of the first `m` elements from `g1`.

### Conclusion:
- The final state of the variables will depend on whether the loop executed or not.
- If the loop executed `m` times, then `output` will contain `m` formatted strings of elements from `g1`.
- If the loop did not execute (`v` remains `2n`), then `output` remains unchanged.

### Output State:
- **If the loop executes**:
  - `output` contains the formatted strings of the first `m` elements from `g1`, where `m` is the number of iterations such that `v` becomes `2m` (less than `2n`).
  - `v` is `2m` where `m` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
  - `g1` is empty after the loop finishes.
- **If the loop does not execute**:
  - `output` contains the original `n` elements `'x x'`.
  - `v` is `2n`.
  - `g1` is not empty and contains remaining elements.

### Final Output State:
**Output State:**
- If the loop executed `m` times, `output` contains the formatted strings of the first `m` elements from `g1`, `v` is `2m`, and `g1` is empty.
- If the loop did not execute, `output` contains the original `n` elements `'x x'`, `v` is `2n`, and `g1` is not empty.
