`res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. Initially, `res2` contains three elements: the first element is its original value, and the second and third elements are both `ai`. After appending `ai`, the length of `res2` increases by one, making it four elements long, with the fourth element being `ai`.

Output State: **`hp` is 2, `cnts2` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is 2, `res2` contains four elements, with the first element being its original value, the second, third, and fourth elements all being `ai`.**
