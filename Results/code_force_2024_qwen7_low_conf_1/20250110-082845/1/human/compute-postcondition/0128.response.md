To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.
2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `n + 1`.

Given the information:
- `a` is a list of integers (this does not change within the loop).
- `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `k` is the original value of `k` (this does not change within the loop).
- `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k` (this does not change within the loop).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the new value of `i`:**
   - If `i` was previously some value `x`, then `i` becomes `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

2. **Check if the loop can continue:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` becomes `x + 1`.

Since the loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`, the new value of `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment is the value of `i`. The value of `i` must be updated to `i + 1` and must remain less than `n + 1`.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`**.
