Postcondition: ***`v` is an integer, `output` is a list, and `g1` is a non-empty iterable. If `v < k`, then `v` is set to 1, `output` contains 'x', and `g1` remains unchanged. If `v` is not less than `k`, then `v` and `output` remain as they were initially, i.e., `v` is 0 and `output` is an empty list, while `g1` remains unchanged.***
