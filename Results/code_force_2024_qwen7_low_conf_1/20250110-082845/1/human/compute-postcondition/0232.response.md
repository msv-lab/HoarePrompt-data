Let's analyze the loop step-by-step and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`.
- `g0` is an empty list.
- `g1` is an empty list.
- `g2` is an empty list.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if occ[i] == 0:
        g0.append(i)
    elif occ[i] == 1:
        g1.append(i)
    else:
        g2.append(i)
```

### Observations
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- For each `i`:
  - If `occ[i]` is 0, `i` is added to `g0`.
  - If `occ[i]` is 1, `i` is added to `g1`.
  - If `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `i` is added to `g2`.

### Final State Analysis
- After the loop finishes, for each `i` from 1 to `n`:
  - If `occ[i]` is 0, `i` will be in `g0`.
  - If `occ[i]` is 1, `i` will be in `g1`.
  - If `occ[i]` is greater than 1, `i` will be in `g2`.

Since the loop iterates from `1` to `n` and processes each integer exactly once based on its count in the dictionary `occ`, the lists `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` will contain all the integers from `1` to `n` categorized according to their occurrence in the dictionary `occ`.

### Output State
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `occ` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `g0` contains all integers from `1` to `n` that appear exactly 0 times in `a`.
- `g1` contains all integers from `1` to `n` that appear exactly 1 time in `a`.
- `g2` contains all integers from `1` to `n` that appear more than 1 time in `a`.
- `n` is the highest integer in the list `a`.

Thus, the final state of the program after the loop completes is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`. `g0` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 0 times in `a`. `g1` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 1 time in `a`. `g2` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` that appear more than 1 time in `a`. `n` is the highest integer in the list `a`.**
