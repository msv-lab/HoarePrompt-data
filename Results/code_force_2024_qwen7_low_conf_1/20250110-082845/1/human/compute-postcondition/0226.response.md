Let's analyze the given loop and the provided state step by step:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `occ` is a dictionary mapping each element from `a` to the total number of times it appears in `a`.
   - `g0` is a list containing `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise.
   - `g1` is a list containing `[i + 1, i]` if `occ[i + 1]` is 1, and an empty list otherwise.
   - `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is not 1.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value \( k \).
   - For the loop to continue, the next value of `i` would be \( k + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be \( k + 1 \).

4. **Dictionary and Lists**:
   - The values of `occ`, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` depend on the value of `occ[i + 1]` at the start of the loop.
   - These values remain unchanged as they are computed based on the current `i`.

5. **New State**:
   - The new value of `i` is \( k + 1 \).
   - Since the loop is dependent on `i` being within the range `[1, n]`, `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `a` remains the same.
- `occ` remains the same.
- `g0` remains the same.
- `g1` remains the same.
- `g2` remains the same.
- `i` is now \( k + 1 \).
- `n` remains the same.

Given that `i` was previously \( k \) and the loop is iterating from 1 to \( n \), for the loop to continue, \( k + 1 \) must be less than or equal to \( n \).

So, the final state is:
State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`. `g0` is a list containing `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise. `g1` is a list containing `[i + 1, i]` if `occ[i + 1]` is 1, and an empty list otherwise. `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is not 1. `i` is \( k + 1 \), and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
