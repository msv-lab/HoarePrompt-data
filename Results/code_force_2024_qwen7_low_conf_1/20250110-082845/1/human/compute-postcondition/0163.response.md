Postcondition: ***`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is incremented by 1 if it is less than `k`. The `output` list contains the formatted string of `x` and an additional string formatted from `x`, assuming the condition `v < k` is met. Otherwise, the state of `v` and `output` remains as per the precondition.***
