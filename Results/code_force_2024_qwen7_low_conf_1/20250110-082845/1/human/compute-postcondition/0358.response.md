The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the variables `cnts`, `singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `ws`, and `wp` remain unchanged after executing the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is `current_wanted_singles + 1` if `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `ws` remains unchanged; `wp` is the same as `wanted_pairs`, now `wp` is equal to `k - wanted_singles >> 1`.**
