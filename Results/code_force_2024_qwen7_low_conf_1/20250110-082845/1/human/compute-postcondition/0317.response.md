According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `cnts`. The loop iterates over each key-value pair in `cnts`. At the end of the previous iteration, `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair. If `cnt` is 1, `singles` is updated to `singles_initial + 1`. Otherwise, `pairs` is incremented by 1.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Condition**: `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are key-value pairs in `cnts`.
3. **Update Conditions**:
   - If `cnt` is 1, `singles` is updated.
   - Otherwise, `pairs` is incremented.

Given these conditions, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop. 

Since the loop is iterating over the key-value pairs in `cnts`, and the condition for the loop to continue is that `cnts` must still have at least one key-value pair, `cnts` will have at least one key-value pair at the start of the next iteration as well.

The update conditions depend on the value of `cnt` in the current iteration, but they do not change the fact that `cnts` must still have at least one key-value pair for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same in terms of the requirement for `cnts`.

**State: **`cnts` must have at least one key-value pair.**
