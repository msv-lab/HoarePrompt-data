The code `res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `ai`, so we cannot determine what exactly gets appended. The other variables (`hp`, `cnts2`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hp` is 1, `cnts2` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is 2, `res2` contains at least one element (the value of `ai`).**
