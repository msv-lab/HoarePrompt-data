`output.append(f'{x}')` appends the string representation of `x` to the list `output`. Since `output` already had one additional element `'x'`, this means it now has two elements: `'x'` and the string representation of `x`.

The variable `v` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, which is unchanged by this code. The variable `g1` remains a non-empty iterable, and the value of `output` changes as described.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`v` is an integer incremented by 1 from its previous value, `output` is a list with two elements, the first is `'x'` and the second is the string representation of `x`, and `g1` is a non-empty iterable**.
