The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `occ` by 1. Given that `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the updated number of times that element appears in `a`, the value of `occ[x]` will be increased by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the updated number of times that element appears in `a`, and the count of the next `x` in `occ` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the updated number of times that element appears in `a`, and the count of the next `x` in `occ` is increased by 1**
