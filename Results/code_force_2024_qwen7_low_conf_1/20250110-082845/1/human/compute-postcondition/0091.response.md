The value of `v` is incremented by 1. The state of `output` and `g1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is an integer plus 1, `output` is a list with one additional element 'x', and `g1` is a non-empty iterable.

Output State: **`v` is an integer plus 1, `output` is a list with one additional element 'x', and `g1` is a non-empty iterable.**
