Postcondition: ***`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element. If `v` is less than `k`, a `NameError` occurs because `v` is not defined. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables and the postcondition remains as the precondition, with `v` equal to its initial value plus 2 and `k` greater than `v`.***
