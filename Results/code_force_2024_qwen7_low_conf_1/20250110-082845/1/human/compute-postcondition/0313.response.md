According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cnts` dictionary. The loop will execute as long as there is at least one key-value pair in `cnts`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition indicates that `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair. This means that if `cnt` is equal to 1, `singles` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `cnt` is not equal to 1, `pairs` is increased by 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **Key-Value Pair Existence**: The loop will continue as long as `cnts` has at least one key-value pair. Therefore, `cnts` must still have at least one key-value pair at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Loop Variable Update**: The variable `num` and `cnt` will be updated to the next key-value pair in the dictionary.

Given that `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair at the start of the next iteration, we can conclude that the state remains the same regarding the existence of key-value pairs. The specific `num` and `cnt` values will change but the overall condition that `cnts` has at least one key-value pair will persist.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cnts` must have at least one key-value pair.**
