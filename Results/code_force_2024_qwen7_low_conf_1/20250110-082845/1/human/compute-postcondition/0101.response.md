The value of `k` is doubled, changing its value from `k` to `2 * k`. The values of `v`, `n`, and `output` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `output` is an undefined list.

Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `output` is an undefined list**
