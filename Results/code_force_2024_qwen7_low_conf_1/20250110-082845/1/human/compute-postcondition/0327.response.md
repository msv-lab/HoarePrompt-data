The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables outside the loop. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement will simply cause the loop to proceed to the next iteration without affecting the values of the variables.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`. `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, and `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is False; `ws` is 0; `wp` is 0; `wanted_singles` is greater than the current value of `singles`; `k` is known and non-negative. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
