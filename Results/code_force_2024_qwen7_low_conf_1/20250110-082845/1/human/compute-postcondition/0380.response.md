`hs` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnts` and `ai` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`, `ai` is the next element in `half`, and `hs` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`, `ai` is the next element in `half`, and `hs` is increased by 1**.
