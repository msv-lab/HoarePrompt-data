Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer >= 1.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `k` is twice its original value.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `occ[x]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for x in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute as long as there are elements left to iterate over.
   - After the end of the previous iteration, the current state needs to be updated for the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
   - `k` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
   - `a` should be updated to exclude the current element that was just processed. Let's assume the loop just processed the first element `a[0]`. Therefore, `a` becomes `a[1:]` (all elements except the first one).
   - `occ` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer >= 1.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `k` is twice its original value.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers, now excluding the first element.
   - `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `occ[x]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`t` is an integer >= 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is twice its original value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the first element), `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `occ[x]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**

State: **`t` is an integer >= 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is twice its original value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the first element), `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `occ[x]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**
