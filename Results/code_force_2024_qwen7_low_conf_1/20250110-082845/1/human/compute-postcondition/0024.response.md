According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n + 1`, so it will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers
- If `occ[i]` is 0, then `g0` contains the element 1.
- If `occ[i]` is 1, then either `g1` or `g2` contains the element 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.

Since `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, and `n` is at least 1, `i` being 2 means the loop can still continue as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

The state of the variables remains the same except for `i`, which is now 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers. If `occ[2]` is 0, then `g0` contains the element 1. If `occ[2]` is 1, then either `g1` or `g2` contains the element 1.**
