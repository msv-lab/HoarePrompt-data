`cnts2` is updated to be a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cnts2` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`; `cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half`; `hp` is the total number of elements in `res2` divided by 2; `res2` contains all elements from `half` that appear exactly twice, each appearing twice; `wp` is its original value; `ws` is 0; `hp` is the total number of elements in `res2` divided by 2; `hs` is the number of elements in `res2`; `tc` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `k` is 2 * `k`; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `half` contains the first `n` elements of `a`; `half2` contains the elements of `a` starting from the `n`-th element; the elements of `res2` are printed.**
