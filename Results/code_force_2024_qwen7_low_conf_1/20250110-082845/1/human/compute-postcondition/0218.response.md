Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` may contain `i` if `occ[i]` equals 1, `g2` contains the key `i` if `occ[i]` does not equal 1, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For every key `j` in `occ`, `occ[j]` is not equal to 0.***
