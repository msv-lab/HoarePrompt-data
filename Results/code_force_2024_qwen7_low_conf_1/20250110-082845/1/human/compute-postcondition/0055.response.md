`output.append(f'{x}')` appends the formatted string of `x` to the list `output`. Given that `v` is a value less than `k` and `g1` contains at least one element, the only change in the state is the addition of the formatted string of `x` to the `output` list.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, v is a value less than k, `output` is a list with the additional element `f'{x}'`**
