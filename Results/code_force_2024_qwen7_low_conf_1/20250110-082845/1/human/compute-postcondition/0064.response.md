`v` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `v` was less than `k` plus 1, so the new value of `v` is now one more than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`g1` and `output`) are not affected.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus 2, `output` contains at least one element which is the formatted string representation of `x`.**
