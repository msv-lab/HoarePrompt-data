`pairs` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cnts` and the condition that `cnt` is not equal to 1 are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair, and the count `cnt` is not equal to 1; `pairs` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`cnts` must have at least one key-value pair, and the count `cnt` is not equal to 1; `pairs` is increased by 1**
