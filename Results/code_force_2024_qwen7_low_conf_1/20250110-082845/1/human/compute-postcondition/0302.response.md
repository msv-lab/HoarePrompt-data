The code `half2 = a[n:]` assigns the slice of the list `a` starting from index `n` to the variable `half2`. This means that `half2` now contains the elements of `a` starting from the `n`-th element up to the end of the list.

Here are the impacts on the variables:
- `cnts2`, `hp`, `res2`, `wp`, `ws`, `hp`, `hs`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- `half` remains unchanged.
- A new variable `half2` is introduced, which contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`cnts2` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half`, `hp` is the total number of elements in `res2` divided by 2, `res2` contains all elements from `half` that appear exactly twice, each appearing twice, `wp` is its original value, `ws` is 0, `hp` is the total number of elements in `res2` divided by 2, `hs` is the number of elements in `res2`, `tc` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 2 * `k`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `half` contains the first `n` elements of `a`, `half2` contains the elements of `a` starting from the `n`-th element, the elements of `res2` are printed.**
