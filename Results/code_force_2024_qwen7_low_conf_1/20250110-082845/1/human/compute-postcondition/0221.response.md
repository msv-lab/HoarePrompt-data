The code `g0.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g0`. Given the initial state, the value of `i + 1` determines the contents of `g0`, `g1`, and `g2`. Since `occ[i + 1]` is 0, `g0` should already contain `i + 1` as per the initial conditions. Appending `i` again to `g0` means `g0` will now contain both `i + 1` and `i`.

The other lists and variables remain unchanged because the code only modifies `g0`. Therefore, `g1` remains an empty list since `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and `g2` remains an empty list since `occ[i + 1]` is 0 and it was not set to contain the key `i + 1` when `occ[i + 1]` was not 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing `i + 1` and `i` (since `occ[i + 1]` is 0), `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For every key `j` in `occ`, `occ[j]` is not equal to 0 if `j` is not `i + 1`.**
