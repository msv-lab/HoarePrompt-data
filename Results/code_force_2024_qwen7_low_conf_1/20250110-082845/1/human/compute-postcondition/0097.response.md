Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `v` is 0
- `output` is an empty list
- `g1` is a non-empty iterable (list, tuple, etc.)

### Loop Code
```python
for x in g1:
    if v < k:
        output.append(f'{x}')
        v += 1
```

### Step-by-Step Execution
1. **First Iteration:**
   - If `v < k`, `output` becomes `['x']` and `v` becomes 1.
   - If `v` is not less than `k`, `output` and `v` remain unchanged.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - If `v < k`, `output` becomes `['x', 'x']` and `v` becomes 2.
   - If `v` is not less than `k`, `output` remains `['x']` and `v` remains 1.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - If `v < k`, `output` becomes `['x', 'x', 'x']` and `v` becomes 3.
   - If `v` is not less than `k`, `output` remains `['x', 'x']` and `v` remains 2.

From the above steps, we can generalize the behavior:
- If `v` is less than `k` and `g1` has at least `k` elements, `output` will contain `k` elements of the form `'x'` and `v` will be `k`.
- If `v` is not less than `k`, or `g1` does not have enough elements, `output` will only contain the appended strings until `v` reaches `k`.

### Final Output State
- `v` will be `k` if the loop executed enough times to increment `v` to `k`, otherwise `v` will be an integer such that `v >= k`.
- `output` will be a list containing `k` elements of the form `'x'`, where `x` is the value of the element in `g1` that was processed by the loop. If the loop did not execute enough times, `output` will be shorter and `v` will be the last value of `v` that satisfied `v < k` before exiting the loop.

### Conclusion
- `v` will be `k` if the loop executed all necessary iterations, otherwise `v` will be an integer such that `v >= k`.
- `output` will be a list containing `k` elements of the form `'x'`, where `x` is the value of the element in `g1` that was processed by the loop. If the loop did not execute enough times, `output` will be shorter.

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v >= k` and `output` is a list containing `k` elements of the form `'x'`, where `x` is the value of the element in `g1` that was processed by the loop. If the loop did not execute enough times, `output` will be shorter and `v` will be the last value of `v` that satisfied `v < k` before exiting the loop.
