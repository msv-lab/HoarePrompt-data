`g1` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `i` is initially 1, `g1` becomes a list containing the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is `[1]`, `g2` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `occ[1]` is equal to 1.**
