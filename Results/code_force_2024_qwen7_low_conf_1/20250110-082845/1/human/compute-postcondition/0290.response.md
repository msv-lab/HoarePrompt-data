The code appends the formatted string `f'{x}'` to the `output` list. Given that `x` is 3, the string `f'{x}'` evaluates to `'3'`. The `output` list originally contains the strings `'x'` and `'2'`. After appending `'3'`, the `output` list will contain three elements: `'x'`, `'2'`, and `'3'`.

Output State: **`g1` must have at least one element, `v` is 3, `output` is a list containing the strings `'x'`, `'2'`, and `'3'`**
