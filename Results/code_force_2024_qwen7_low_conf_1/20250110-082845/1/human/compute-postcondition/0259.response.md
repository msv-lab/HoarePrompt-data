`output.append(f'{x}')` appends the formatted string of `x` to the list `output`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, we cannot determine the exact string that will be appended. However, we know that `output` will be modified, and the `append` method adds the specified string to the end of the list.

The precondition states that `output` remains unchanged if `v + 1 < k` or is updated with the formatted string of `x` if `v + 1 < k`. Given that the code snippet does not include the condition check for `v + 1 < k`, we assume that the condition `v + 1 < k` is true, as this is the only way the code snippet can execute without error and modify `output`.

Therefore, the formatted string of `x` is appended to `output`.

Output State: **`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element, `v` is incremented by 1, and `output` is a list containing the formatted string of `x`.**
