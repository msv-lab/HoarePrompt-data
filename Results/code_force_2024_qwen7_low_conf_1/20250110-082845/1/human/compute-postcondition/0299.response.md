`a` is assigned the values from the input split into a list of integers. The input is converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts2` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half`, `hp` is the total number of elements in `res2` divided by 2, `res2` contains all elements from `half` that appear exactly twice, each appearing twice, `wp` is its original value, `ws` is 0, `hp` is the total number of elements in `res2` divided by 2, `hs` is the number of elements in `res2`, `tc` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, the elements of `res2` are printed.**
