The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` will be assigned the values provided by the user as two separate integers. The variable `v` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation, and the list `output` is not defined or modified in this snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v >= k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `output` is an undefined list**
