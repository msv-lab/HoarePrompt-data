Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v >= k` and `output` is a list containing `k` elements of the form `'x'`, where `x` is the value of the element in `g1` that was processed by the loop. If the loop did not execute enough times, `output` will be shorter and `v` will be the last value of `v` that satisfied `v < k` before exiting the loop. The print statement outputs the concatenated string of the list `output` separated by spaces.**
