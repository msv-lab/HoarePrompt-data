`v` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `v` before the increment is not known. The value of `g1`, `output`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus 1, `output` is a list with the additional element `f'{x}'`**
