The code initializes an empty list named `output`. No changes are made to the existing variables `a`, `occ`, `k`, `v`, or `n`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `output` list.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `output` is an empty list**
