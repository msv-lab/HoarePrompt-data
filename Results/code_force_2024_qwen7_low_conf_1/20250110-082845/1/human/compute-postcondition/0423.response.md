`hp` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `hp` is 0, so the new value of `hp` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hp` is 1, and `cnts2` must have at least one key-value pair. The value of `cnt` is 2.

Output State: **`hp` is 1, and `cnts2` must have at least one key-value pair. The value of `cnt` is 2.**
