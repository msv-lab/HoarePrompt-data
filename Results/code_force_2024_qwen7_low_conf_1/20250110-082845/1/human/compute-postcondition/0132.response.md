Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `occ[i] == 1`, then `g1` is a list containing its original contents plus the value of `i` (which was originally `i + 1`). Otherwise, `g2` is a list with `i` (originally `i + 1`) appended to it.***
