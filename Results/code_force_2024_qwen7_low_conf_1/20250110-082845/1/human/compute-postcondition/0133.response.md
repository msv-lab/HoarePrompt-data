Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `occ[i] == 0`, then `i` is appended to `g0`. Otherwise, if `occ[i] == 1`, `g1` is a list containing its original contents plus the value of `i`. If `occ[i] != 1`, `g2` is a list with `i` appended to it.***
