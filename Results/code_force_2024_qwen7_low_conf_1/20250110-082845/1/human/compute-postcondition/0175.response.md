`v` is initially equal to its original value plus 2, which means `v` is 2. The code increments `v` by 2, making `v` equal to 4. The states of the other variables (`output` and `g0`) are not affected.

Output State: **`v` is 4, `output` is ['{x} {x}', '{x} {x}'], `g0` must contain at least one element**
