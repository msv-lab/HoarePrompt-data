`v` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `v` is `v + 1`. The values of `g1`, `k`, `x`, and `output` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element, `v` is `v + 1`, `x` is a value that satisfies `v < k`, and `output` is a list with one additional element which is the formatted string of `x`.**
