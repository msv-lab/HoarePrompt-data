`res1.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res1`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `cnts` remains unchanged, `ai` is the next element in `half`, and `hs` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`, `res1` contains the appended value of `ai`, `ai` is the next element in `half`, and `hs` is increased by 1**
