The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a hypothetical loop. Therefore, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`. `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, and `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is False; `ws` is 0; `wp` is 0; `wanted_singles` is greater than the current value of `singles`; `k` is known and non-negative. The condition `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1` holds true.**
