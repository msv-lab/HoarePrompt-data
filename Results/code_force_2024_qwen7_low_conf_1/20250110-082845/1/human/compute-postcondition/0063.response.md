The code snippet `output.append(f'{x}')` appends the formatted string representation of `x` to the list `output`. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. We know that `v` is a value less than `k` plus 1, but this does not affect the value of `x`. Since `x` is not defined or given a specific value in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. Therefore, the only change is the addition of a formatted string representation of `x` to the list `output`.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus 1, `output` contains at least one element which is the formatted string representation of `x`.**
