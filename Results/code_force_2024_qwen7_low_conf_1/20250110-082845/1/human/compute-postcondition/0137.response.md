Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `g2`.
   - Therefore, the key variables involved are `x` (the variable used in the loop) and `g2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - `k` is the original value of `k`.
   - `v` is 0.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `output` is an empty list.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `g2` is not empty. 

4. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `g2`, `g2` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - We do not need to adjust the values of `a`, `occ`, `k`, `v`, `n`, or `output` specifically for the loop to execute; these are either already provided or not directly involved in the loop condition.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `g2` must contain at least one element.

**Final State:**
State: **`g2` must contain at least one element**
