To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the changes that occur within the loop.

### Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`.
- `g0` is a list containing `i` if `occ[i]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise.
- `g1` is an empty list if `occ[i]` is 0, and may contain `i` if `occ[i]` is 1.
- `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i]` is 0, and contains the key `i` if `occ[i]` is not 1.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- For every key `j` in `occ`, `occ[j]` is not equal to 0 if `j` is not `i`.

### Loop Execution Analysis:
The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Let's consider what happens to the variables during each iteration:

1. **For the loop to execute one more time:**
   - The variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` should be `i + 1`.
   - Since `n` is fixed, it remains the same.

2. **State Adjustments:**
   - `a` and `occ` remain unchanged as they are not modified inside the loop.
   - `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` will depend on the new value of `i`:
     - If `occ[i+1]` is 0, then `g0` will contain `i+1`.
     - If `occ[i+1]` is 1, then `g1` might contain `i+1`.
     - If `occ[i+1]` is not 1 (i.e., it is greater than 1), then `g2` will contain `i+1`.

Given these considerations, we need to update the state to reflect the new value of `i`.

### Updated States:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same (since `n` is a constant defined outside the loop).

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`. `g0` is a list containing `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise. `g1` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and may contain `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 1. `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is not 1. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For every key `j` in `occ`, `occ[j]` is not equal to 0 if `j` is not `i + 1`.**
