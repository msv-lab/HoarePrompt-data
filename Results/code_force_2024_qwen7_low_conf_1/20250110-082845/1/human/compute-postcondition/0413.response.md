`res1` appends the value `ai` to its list. The value of `hp` is incremented by 2, and the dictionary `cnts` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is incremented by 2, and `res1` has an additional element `ai` appended to it.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is incremented by 2, and `res1` has an additional element `ai` appended to it.**
