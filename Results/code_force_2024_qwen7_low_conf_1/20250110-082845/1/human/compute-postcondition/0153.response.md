`output.append(f'{x}')` appends the formatted string of `x` to the list `output`. The initial state specifies that `g1` must contain at least one element, `g2` must contain elements that satisfy the condition `v < k`, and the current value of `v` is less than `k`. However, the values of `x`, `g1`, `g2`, and `v` are not specified, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `g2` must contain elements that satisfy the condition `v < k`, the current value of `v` is less than `k`, and `output` contains the formatted string of `x`.**
