Postcondition: ***`hp` is 1, `cnts2` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is 2, `res2` contains at least two elements, with the first element being its original value and the second element being `ai`. Since there is no else part in the if statement, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
