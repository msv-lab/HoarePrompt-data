The code `v += 2` attempts to increment the value of `v` by 2, but since `v` is not defined in the initial state, this line of code will raise a `NameError`. No changes are made to any variables, and the original state remains unchanged.

Output State: **A `NameError` will occur because `v` is not defined.**
