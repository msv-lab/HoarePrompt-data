Postcondition: ***`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element, `v` is incremented by 1. If there is a value `x` in `g1` such that `v < k`, `output` is a list with at least two elements where the first element is a formatted string of `x` and the second element is the same formatted string. Otherwise, `output` remains unchanged.***
