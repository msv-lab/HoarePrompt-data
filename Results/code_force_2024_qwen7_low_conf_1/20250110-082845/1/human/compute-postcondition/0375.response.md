`res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. This operation does not affect the values of `cnts[ai]`, `hs`, `res1`, or the dictionary `cnts`. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnts[ai]` is 0, `hs` is incremented by 1, `res1` contains `ai`, `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `res2` contains `ai`.

Output State: **`cnts[ai]` is 0, `hs` is incremented by 1, `res1` contains `ai`, `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `res2` contains `ai`.**
