The code `res1.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res1`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `ai`. Therefore, the value of `ai` remains unspecified, and the only change is that `res1` now contains the value of `ai`.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` equals `wp + 1`, `wp` equals `hp - 1`, `cnt` equals 2, `res1` contains `ai`**
