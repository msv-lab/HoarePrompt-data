`res1` has its value updated by appending `ai` to it. The previous state of `cnts` and `hp` is unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is increased by 1, `res1` is a list with an additional element `ai` appended to it.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is increased by 1, `res1` is a list with an additional element `ai` appended to it**
