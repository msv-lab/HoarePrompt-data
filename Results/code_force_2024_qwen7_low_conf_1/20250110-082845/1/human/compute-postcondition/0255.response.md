The code snippet appends the formatted string of `x` to the list `output`. Since the initial state indicates that `output` is a list with at least one element which is a formatted string of a value `x` that satisfies `v < k`, and the code does not change the value of `x` but only appends it to `output`, the updated `output` will contain two elements: the original element and the new formatted string of `x`.

Output State: **`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element, `v` is incremented by 1, and `output` is a list with at least two elements where the first element is a formatted string of a value `x` that satisfies `v < k` and the second element is the same formatted string.**
