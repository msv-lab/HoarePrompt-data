The code `v = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `v`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `occ`, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2`. Therefore, the only change is that `v` is now 0.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists that contain elements based on the value of `occ[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`; `v` is 0.**
