According to the given for loop, the loop can execute based on the variable `n`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 1. 

Let's break down the states that need to be adjusted:

1. **`a` is a list of integers**: This state remains unchanged as the loop itself does not modify the list `a`.
2. **`occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`**: This state also remains unchanged as the loop itself does not modify the dictionary `occ`.
3. **`g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list**: These lists remain unchanged as well.

The only state that affects the execution of the loop is `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
