Output State: **`g1` is an iterable containing elements, `v` is the final value after iterating through `g1` (which could be the length of `g1` if `v < k` holds for all elements), and `output` is a list containing formatted strings of elements `x` from `g1` where `v < k` held true for those elements. If no such `x` exists, `output` remains unchanged.**
