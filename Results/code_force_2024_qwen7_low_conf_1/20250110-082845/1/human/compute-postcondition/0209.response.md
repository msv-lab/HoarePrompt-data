The code initializes three empty lists `g0`, `g1`, and `g2`. The variables `a` and `occ` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list.**
