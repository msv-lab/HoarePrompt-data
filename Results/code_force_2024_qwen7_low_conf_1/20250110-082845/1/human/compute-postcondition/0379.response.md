Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`, `ai` is the next element in `half`. If `hs` equals `ws`, the function continues with the current state of `cnts` and `ai`. Otherwise, the function also continues with the current state of `cnts` and `ai`.***
