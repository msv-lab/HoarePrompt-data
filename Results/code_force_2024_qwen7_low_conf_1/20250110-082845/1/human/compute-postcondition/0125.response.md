`g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. Since `i` was previously updated to `i + 1` in the initial state, the value of `i` is now `i + 1`. The list `g2` was initially either `[1]` or empty, depending on the value of `occ[i + 1]`, and it is now updated to include the value `i + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, `g0` contains `1`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is a list containing `[1, i + 1]` or just `[i + 1]`, and `i + 1` is 2, otherwise, `g1` and `g2` are either `[1]` or empty lists, and `i + 1` is 2.**
