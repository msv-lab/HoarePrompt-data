`v` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `v` is a value less than `k` plus 1, so after incrementing, `v` will still be less than `k` plus 1. The values of `g1` and `output` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus 1, and the `output` list has two elements, both equal to `f'{x}'`.**
