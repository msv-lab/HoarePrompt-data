The code snippet appends the key `i` from the dictionary `occ` to the list `g0`. Since the initial state specifies that for the key `i` in `occ`, the value of `occ[i]` is 0, this information remains unchanged. The other variables `a`, `occ`, `g1`, `g2`, and `n` are not directly affected by this line of code.

The impact of the code is that `i` is added to `g0`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing `i`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and for the key `i` in `occ`, the value of `occ[i]` is 0**
