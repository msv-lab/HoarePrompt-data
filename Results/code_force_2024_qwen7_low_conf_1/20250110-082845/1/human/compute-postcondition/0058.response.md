According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `g1`. For the loop to execute again, `g1` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `g1` must contain at least one element.
- `v` is a value less than `k` plus 1.
- The `output` list has an additional element `f'{x}'`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` will be the next element from `g1`.
- Since `g1` must contain at least one element, it will still contain at least one element after the next iteration.
- `v` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The `output` list will have another element added, which will be `f'{x}'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus 1, and the `output` list has an additional element `f'{x}'`.**
