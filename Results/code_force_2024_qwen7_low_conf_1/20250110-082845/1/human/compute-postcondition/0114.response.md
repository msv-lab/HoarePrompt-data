The code appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `g0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `g0` is a list containing `1`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `occ[i]` is 0**
