The code `g0.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g0`. Given that `i` is \( k + 1 \), the list `g0` will now contain the value \( k + 1 \). The other lists and dictionaries remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing `k + 1`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, `i` is \( k + 1 \), and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
