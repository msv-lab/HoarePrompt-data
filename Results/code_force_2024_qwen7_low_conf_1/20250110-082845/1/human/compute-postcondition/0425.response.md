The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. Since `res2` initially contains at least one element, appending `ai` will add another element to the list. The value of `ai` is not specified, so we'll keep it as `ai`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`hp` is 1, `cnts2` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is 2, `res2` contains at least two elements, with the first element being its original value and the second element being `ai`.**
