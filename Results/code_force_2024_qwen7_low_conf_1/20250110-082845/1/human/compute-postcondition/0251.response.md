The code `output.append(f'{x}')` appends the formatted string of `x` to the list `output`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `x`. Therefore, we can only say that `x` is a value that satisfies the condition `v < k`. The output state will include this updated information.

Output State: **`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k`, `x` is a value that satisfies `v < k`, and `output` is a list with one additional element which is the formatted string of `x`.**
