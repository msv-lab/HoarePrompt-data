Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers. `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists that contain elements based on the value of `occ[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. Specifically, for each `i`:
- If `occ[i] == 0`, then `i` is in `g0`.
- If `occ[i] == 1`, then `i` is in `g1`.
- If `occ[i] > 1`, then `i` is in `g2`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), then `i` is 1, `n` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of 1 integer (which is 0), and `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are all empty lists.
