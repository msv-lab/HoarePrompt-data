Postcondition: ***`g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is a value less than `k` plus 1, and the `output` list has either one or two elements, both equal to `f'{x}'`. If `v` is less than `k`, the `output` list will have two elements, both equal to `f'{x}'`. Otherwise, the `output` list will have one element, which is `f'{x}'`.***
