The code `g1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `g1`. This changes the value of `g1` from its initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`; `a` is a non-empty list of integers; `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, and `occ[i]` is equal to 1; `g1` is a list containing the element 1**
