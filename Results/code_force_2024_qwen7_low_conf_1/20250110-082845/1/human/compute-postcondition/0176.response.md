Postcondition: ***`v` is an integer and equal to its original value plus 2 (which is 4). `output` is a list containing at least two elements, each being '{x} {x}'. `g0` must contain at least one element. If `v < k`, then `v` remains 4, `output` remains ['{x} {x}', '{x} {x}'], and `g0` must still contain at least one element. If `v >= k`, then the state of `v`, `output`, and `g0` does not change from their preconditions.***
