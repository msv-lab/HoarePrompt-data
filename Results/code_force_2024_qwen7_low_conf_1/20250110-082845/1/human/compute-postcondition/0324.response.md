The code `wp = 0` initializes the variable `wp` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `wp` and keeps the values of `cnts`, `singles`, `pairs`, `found`, and `ws` unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` must be a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`. `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, and `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is False; `ws` is 0; `wp` is 0**
