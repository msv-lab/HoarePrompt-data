`occ[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, but it is clear that `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. The value of `occ[x]` will be updated to 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer >= 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is twice its original value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `occ[x]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**
