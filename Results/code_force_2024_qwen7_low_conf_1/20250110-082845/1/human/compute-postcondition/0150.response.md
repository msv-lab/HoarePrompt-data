Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v == v_original + 2 * (number_of_iterations)`, `k` is an integer, and `output` is a list containing strings of the form `f'{x} {x}'` where `x` is an element of `g2` and the total number of such strings is equal to the number of elements in `g2` that satisfy the condition `v < k`. If no elements in `g2` satisfy the condition `v < k`, then `output` remains an empty list.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Initially, `v` is 0, and `output` is an empty list.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - For each iteration of the loop, if `v < k`, the following actions are taken:
    - A string `f'{x} {x}'` is appended to `output`.
    - `v` is incremented by 2.
  - After each iteration, `v` increases by 2, making it `v_original + 2 * (number_of_iterations)`.

### Conditions:
- If `g2` is empty or no elements in `g2` satisfy the condition `v < k`, the loop will not execute, and `output` will remain an empty list.
- If `g2` is not empty and there are elements that satisfy the condition `v < k`, the loop will append the appropriate strings to `output`.

### Final State:
- `v` will be `v_original + 2 * (number_of_iterations)`, where `number_of_iterations` is the number of times the loop executed.
- `output` will contain the strings `f'{x} {x}'` for all `x` in `g2` that satisfied the condition `v < k` during the loop iterations.
