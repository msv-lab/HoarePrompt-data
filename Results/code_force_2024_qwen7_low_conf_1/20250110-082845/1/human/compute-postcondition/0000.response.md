`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This means `t` now holds the value entered by the user, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer entered by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
