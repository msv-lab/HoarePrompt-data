The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but rather exits the loop or the most internal conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement within the given code snippet, the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`hp` is 1, `cnts2` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is 2, `res2` contains at least two elements, with the first element being its original value and the second element being `ai`.**
