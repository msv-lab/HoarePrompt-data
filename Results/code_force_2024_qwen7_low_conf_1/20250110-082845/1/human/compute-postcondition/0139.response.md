The given code snippet does not affect any of the existing variables `v`, `k`, or `output`. Instead, it appends a formatted string to the `output` list. Since the initial state does not provide any information about `output`, we assume that `output` is an empty list initially.

The code `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` will append the string `f'{x} {x}'` to the `output` list. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the given initial state or within the code snippet. Given this, we cannot determine the exact string that will be appended. We only know that a string will be added to the `output` list.

Since no specific value is provided for `x`, we cannot specify the exact string. Thus, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`v` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `v` is less than `k`; `output` is a list with one element which is a string `f'{x} {x}'`**.
