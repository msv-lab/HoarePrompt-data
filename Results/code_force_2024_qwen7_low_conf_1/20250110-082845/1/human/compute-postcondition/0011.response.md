The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1. Given that `occ[x]` was initially set to 2, after this line of code, `occ[x]` will become 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer â‰¥ 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is twice its original value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the first element, now with one less element), `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `occ[x]` is 3 and all other elements are 0.**
