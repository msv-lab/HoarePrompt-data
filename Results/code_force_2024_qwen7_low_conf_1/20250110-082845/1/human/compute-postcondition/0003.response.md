The code `k = 2 * k` doubles the value of `k`. The initial value of `k` is an integer entered by the user. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer entered by the user such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer entered by the user; `k` is twice its original value**
