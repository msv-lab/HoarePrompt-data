To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

Given:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers
- `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists that contain elements based on the value of `occ[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`
- `v` is 0
- `output` is an empty list

The for loop:
```
for x in g2:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will only execute if `g2` is not an empty list.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Given that `i` is `n + 1`, we need to check if this value makes sense in the context of the loop. Since `i` starts from `n + 1`, it does not directly affect whether `g2` is non-empty.
3. **List `g2`**: For the loop to execute, `g2` must contain at least one element.

Given that `g2` is supposed to contain elements based on the value of `occ[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and `i` is `n + 1`, this means `g2` might be empty because there is no corresponding `occ[n+1]`.

Therefore, the critical state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `g2` is not empty.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists that contain elements based on the value of `occ[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `v` is 0, `output` is an empty list, and `g2` must contain at least one element.**

So, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are lists that contain elements based on the value of `occ[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `v` is 0, `output` is an empty list, and `g2` must contain at least one element.**
