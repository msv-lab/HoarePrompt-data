According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list, and `occ[x]` has been incremented by 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop:

1. Since `a` is a non-empty list, it means there are elements left to iterate over.
2. The loop will execute again as long as there are elements in `a`.
3. For the next iteration, we need to increment the value of `x` (the current element being processed) and ensure that `occ[x]` is incremented again.

Given that `a` is a non-empty list, we can conclude that there is at least one element left in `a` for the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `x` is set to the next element in `a` and `occ[x]` is incremented by 1.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `occ[x]` is incremented by 1, and `x` is the next element in `a`**
