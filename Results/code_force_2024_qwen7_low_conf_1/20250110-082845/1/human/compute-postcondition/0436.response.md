Postcondition: **`hp` is 2, `cnts2` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is updated to the count of the next key-value pair, `res2` contains four elements, with the first element being its original value, the second, third, and fourth elements all being `ai`. If `hp` equals `wp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
