The code snippet `wp = wanted_pairs` simply assigns the value of `wanted_pairs` to `wp`. This does not affect any other variables. Given the initial state, the only change is that `wp` is now equal to `wanted_pairs`.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles`; `wp` is equal to `wanted_pairs`.**
