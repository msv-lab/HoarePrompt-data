The code snippet appends a string to the `output` list. The string is formatted as `f'{x} {x}'`. Since the loop body is omitted, the only impact is on the `output` list and the value of `x`.

- `v` was incremented by 2 in the previous iteration, so now it is `v + 4`.
- `k` remains an integer.
- `v` must still be less than `k`.
- `output` is updated by appending a new string to it.

Given the initial state:
- `v` is `v + 2`.
- `k` is an integer.
- `v` is less than `k`.
- `output` is a list with one element, which is a string `f'{x} {x}'`.

After the code `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` executes:
- `output` will have two elements: the original element and the new string `f'{x} {x}'`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`v` is `v + 4`, `k` is an integer, `v` must be less than `k`, `output` is a list with two elements: the original element and the string `f'{x} {x}'`**.
