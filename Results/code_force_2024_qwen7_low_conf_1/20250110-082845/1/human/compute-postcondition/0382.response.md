The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. The initial state includes the following variables:

- `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`.
- `res1` contains the appended value of `ai`.
- `ai` is the next element in `half`.
- `hs` is increased by 1.

After executing the line `res2.append(ai)`, the value of `res2` will include the value of `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their described states.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `res1` contains the appended value of `ai`; `ai` is the next element in `half`; `hs` is increased by 1; `res2` contains the appended value of `ai`.**
