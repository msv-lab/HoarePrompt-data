Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and for every key `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is not equal to 0. For the current iteration, there exists a key `i` in `occ` such that `occ[i]` is equal to 1.**
