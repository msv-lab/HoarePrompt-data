`ws` is assigned the value of `wanted_singles`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, and `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles`; `wp` is 0; `wanted_pairs` is `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`.
