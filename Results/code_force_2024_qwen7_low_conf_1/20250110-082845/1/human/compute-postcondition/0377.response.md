To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider how the loop variable `ai` changes and how the loop's condition is checked.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration includes:
   - `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`.
   - If `cnts[ai]` is 1, `hs` is incremented by 1 and `res1` contains `ai`. Otherwise, `res2` contains `ai`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `half` using `ai` as the current element being processed.

3. **Effect of Loop Execution**:
   - For the next iteration, `ai` will be the next element in `half`.
   - We need to ensure that `cnts[ai]` is still valid (i.e., `ai` is in `half`).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `cnts`: Since the dictionary `cnts` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, we assume `cnts` remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `half`: The value of `half` does not change during the loop execution; it is the same as at the start of the loop.
   - `ai`: For the next iteration, `ai` will be the next element in `half`.

5. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `half`.
   - Therefore, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the value of `ai` to be the next element in `half`.

### Final State:

State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`, `ai` is the next element in `half`**.
