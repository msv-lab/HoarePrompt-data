The code `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a formatted string containing `x x` to the list `output`. Since the initial state of `output` is a list containing one more element `'x x'`, after appending `f'{x} {x}'`, the list `output` will contain two elements: `'x x'` and `f'{x} {x}'`.

Other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`output` is a list containing two elements: `'x x'` and `f'{x} {x}'`, `total` is 0, `i` is still `n + 1`, `n` is still an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is still a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is still a list of `n + 1` integers, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` remain unchanged in terms of their structure but will have one less element after the loop processes one element, `v` is `v + 4` and `g2` must have at least two elements.**
