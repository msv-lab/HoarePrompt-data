The code initializes three empty lists `g0`, `g1`, and `g2`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `occ`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer â‰¥ 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is twice its original value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `occ[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list.**
