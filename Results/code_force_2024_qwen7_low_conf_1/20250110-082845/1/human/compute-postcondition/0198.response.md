`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The input is expected to be two space-separated integers. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`v` is either its original value (0) or an even number, `output` is a list containing all pairs `{x} {x}` where `x` is an element from `g0` until `v` reaches `k`, `g1` is empty, and `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.
