Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is either `[1]` or an empty list, `g2` is either `[1]` or an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `occ[1]` is equal to 1 if `occ[i] == 1`, otherwise `occ[1]` is not equal to 1.***
