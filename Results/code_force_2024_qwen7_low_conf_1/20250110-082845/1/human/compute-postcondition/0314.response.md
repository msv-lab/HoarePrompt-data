`singles` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `singles` was part of the precondition, but since it's not specified, we'll denote its previous value as `singles_initial`. After executing the line `singles += 1`, the new value of `singles` is `singles_initial + 1`.

Output State: **`singles` is `singles_initial + 1`, `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair.**
