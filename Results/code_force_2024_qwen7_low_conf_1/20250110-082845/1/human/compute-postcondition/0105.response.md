`occ[x]` is incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `occ` or `x`. The only variable that is directly affected is `occ[x]`, which is incremented by 1. The state of `a` remains unchanged since the code snippet does not interact with `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list (contains at least one element); `occ[x]` is incremented by 1**
