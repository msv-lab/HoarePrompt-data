The code `g2.append(i)` appends the key `i` from the dictionary `occ` to the list `g2`. The variable `i` represents keys from the dictionary `occ`, which are elements from the list `a`. Since `occ[i]` is not equal to 1 for any key `i`, the value of `i` remains unchanged, and the only change is that `i` is added to the list `g2`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` contains the key `i` (elements from `a`), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and for every key `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is not equal to 1**
