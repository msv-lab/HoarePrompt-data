The code initializes a list `occ` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `v`, `n`, `k`, `output`, or `a`. 

Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `output` is an undefined list, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0**
