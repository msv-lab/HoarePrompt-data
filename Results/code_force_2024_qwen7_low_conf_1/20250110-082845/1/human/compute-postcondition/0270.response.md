Postcondition: ***`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element, `v` is incremented by 2. If `v` is less than `k`, `output` is a list containing one element which is a string formatted as `'x x'` where `x` is less than `k`. There is no else part provided, so if `v` is not less than `k`, the postcondition remains undefined within this context.***
