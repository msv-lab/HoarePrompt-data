`g0` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 1. The value of `i` remains 1, `n` remains an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` remains a non-empty list of integers, and `occ` remains a list of `n + 1` integers with the current value of `occ[i]` being 0. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers, the current value of `occ[1]` is 0, and `g0` contains the element 1.**
