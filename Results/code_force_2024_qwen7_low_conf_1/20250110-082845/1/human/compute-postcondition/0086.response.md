`output.append(f'{x}')` adds the string representation of `x` to the list `output`. However, the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot specify what exactly is appended to `output`. The only thing we know for sure is that `v` remains 0 and `g1` is unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is 0, `output` is a list containing 'x', `g1` must be a non-empty iterable**
