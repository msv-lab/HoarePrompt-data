The code `wp = wanted_pairs` assigns the value of `wanted_pairs` to the variable `wp`. This does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is `wanted_singles`; `wp` is the same as `wanted_pairs`.**
