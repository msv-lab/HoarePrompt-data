`output` is an empty list before the code is executed. The code appends a formatted string of `x` to the `output` list. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only say that `output` will contain a single element which is a string formatted as `'x'`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. So, the output state is: `g1` must have at least one element, `output` is a list containing the string `'x'`, `v` is 0, and `v` is less than `k`.

Output State: **`g1` must have at least one element, `output` is a list containing the string `'x'`, `v` is 0, and `v` is less than `k`**
