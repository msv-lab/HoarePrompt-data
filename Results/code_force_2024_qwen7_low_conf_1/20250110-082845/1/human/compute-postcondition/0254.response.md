Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `g1` is an iterable containing at least one element.
   - `v` is incremented by 1 (so it was `v-1` at the beginning of the previous iteration).
   - `output` is a list with at least one element, which is a formatted string of a value `x` that satisfies `v-1 < k`. If no such `x` exists, `output` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `g1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `x` in `g1`, the loop body is executed. However, the specific actions within the loop body are not provided, so we focus on the general state changes.

4. **State Changes:**
   - `v` is incremented by 1.
   - `output` may or may not change based on the loop body logic. Since no specific changes are mentioned, we assume `output` might remain unchanged if no suitable `x` is found.

5. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `g1` must still contain at least one element.
   - `v` must be such that there is at least one element `x` in `g1` that satisfies `v < k`.

6. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `g1` must still contain at least one element.
   - `v` is now `v+1` from the previous iteration.
   - `output` may remain unchanged or could potentially be updated depending on the loop body, but without specific details, we consider the worst-case scenario where it remains unchanged.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `g1` must contain at least one element.
- `v` is incremented by 1 from the previous value.
- `output` remains unchanged.

So, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`g1` is an iterable containing at least one element, `v` is incremented by 1, and `output` is a list with at least one element which is a formatted string of a value `x` that satisfies `v < k`. If no such `x` exists, `output` remains unchanged.**
