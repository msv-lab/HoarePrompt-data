Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is `current_wanted_singles + 1` if `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `ws` remains unchanged; `wp` is the same as `wanted_pairs`. If `wanted_singles` is greater than `singles`, then `ws` is updated to `singles + 1` when `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1`, otherwise no changes are made to `ws`.***
