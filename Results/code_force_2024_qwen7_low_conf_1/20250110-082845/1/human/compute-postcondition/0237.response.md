The code `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a formatted string to the `output` list. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `x`, `output`, `g2`, or `v`. We know that `g2` is not empty, `v` is less than `k`, but `x` could be any value. Since the code only modifies the `output` list and does not provide a specific value for `x`, we can only say that `output` now contains the string `f'{x} {x}'`.

Output State: **`g2` is not empty, `v` is less than `k`, `output` contains the string 'x x'**
