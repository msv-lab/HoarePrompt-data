The code appends the value of `i` to the list `g1`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `i + 1`. Therefore, `g1` will now contain the element `i + 1`.

- `occ[i + 1]` is either 0, 1, or the condition `i + 1` is 2.
- If `occ[i + 1]` is 0, `g0` contains `1`.
- If `occ[i + 1]` is 1, `g1` is `[1]` or an empty list, and `g2` is `[1]` or an empty list.
- If `occ[i + 1]` is 2, `g1` and `g2` are either `[1]` or empty lists, and `i + 1` is 2.

After appending `i + 1` to `g1`, the updated state of `g1` will be `[i + 1]` if `occ[i + 1]` is 1 or 2, or `[1, i + 1]` if `occ[i + 1]` was already 1. The value of `i` is not directly accessible in the output state, but we know that `i` is `i + 1` from the precondition.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, `g0` contains `1`, `g1` is `[i + 1]` or `[1, i + 1]`, `g2` is `[1]` or an empty list, and `i + 1` is 2.**
