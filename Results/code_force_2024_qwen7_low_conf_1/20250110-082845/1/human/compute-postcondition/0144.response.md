`v` is initially `v + 4`, and it is incremented by 2, making it `v + 6`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as an integer, and `output` is a list with the original element `v + 4` and the string `f'{v + 4} {v + 4}'`. Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `v` is now `v + 6`
- `k` is an integer
- `output` is `[v + 4, f'{v + 4} {v + 4}']`

Output State: **`v` is `v + 6`, `k` is an integer, `output` is `[v + 4, f'{v + 4} {v + 4}']**
