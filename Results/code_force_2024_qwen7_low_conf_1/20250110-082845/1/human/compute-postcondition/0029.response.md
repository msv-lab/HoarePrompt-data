Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` integers. After the execution of the if-else block, if `occ[2]` is 0, then `g0` contains the element 2. If `occ[2]` is 1, then either `g1` or `g2` contains the element 1, and `g1` contains the element 2. If `occ[2]` is not 1, then `g2` contains the element 2.***
