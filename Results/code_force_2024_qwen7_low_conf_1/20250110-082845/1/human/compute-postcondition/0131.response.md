The code `g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. Given the initial state where `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`, the value of `i` is updated to `i + 1` and then appended to `g2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is an integer such that `v >= 2 * k`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is now `i + 1` and is appended to `g2`**
