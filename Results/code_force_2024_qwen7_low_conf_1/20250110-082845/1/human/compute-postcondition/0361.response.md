The code sets `ws` to the value of `wanted_singles`. This means that the previous value of `ws` (which was `current_wanted_singles + 1` if `(k - wanted_singles) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `ws` remained unchanged) is now replaced by the value of `wanted_singles`. The other variables (`cnts`, `singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `wp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles`; `wp` is the same as `wanted_pairs`, now `wp` is equal to `k - wanted_singles >> 1`. If `wanted_pairs > pairs`, the condition is met and no changes are applied; otherwise, the postconditions remain the same as the preconditions.**
