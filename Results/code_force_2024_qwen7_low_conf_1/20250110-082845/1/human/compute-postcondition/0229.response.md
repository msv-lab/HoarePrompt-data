The code `g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. From the initial state, `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is not 1. Since `g2.append(i)` is executed, `g2` will now contain the value of `i`.

Given that `i` is \( k + 1 \), the updated state for `g2` will include the value \( k + 1 \).

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise, `g1` is a list containing `[i + 1, i]` if `occ[i + 1]` is 1, and an empty list otherwise, `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is not 1, and `g2` now contains the value `k + 1`, `i` is \( k + 1 \), and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
