The code appends a formatted string to the `output` list. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, it remains undefined. However, we know `output` is initially an empty list, and the code appends the string `f'{x} {x}'` to it. Given that `x` is not specified, the string will remain in its placeholder form. 

The value of `v` and the condition `v < k` are unaffected, and `g0` remains unchanged as it was not involved in this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`v` is less than `k`, `output` is ['{x} {x}'], `g0` contains at least one element**
