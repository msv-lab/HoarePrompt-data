The code initializes a list `occ` with zeros, where the length of the list is `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not affected by this line of code. The list `occ` is created but does not contain any specific values yet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer entered by the user such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer entered by the user; `k` is twice its original value; `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided by the user; `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**
