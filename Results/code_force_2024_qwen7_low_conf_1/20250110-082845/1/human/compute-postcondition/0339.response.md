The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the current loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once, and `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles`; `wp` is `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`; `wanted_pairs` is `(k - wanted_singles) // 2`.**
