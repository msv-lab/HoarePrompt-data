`singles` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnts` is not affected, and the value of `cnt` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnts` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is equal to 1, `singles` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`cnts` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is equal to 1, `singles` is incremented by 1**
