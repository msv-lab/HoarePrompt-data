State before the loop starts: The loop will execute if `g1` is an iterable that contains at least one element. Since we don't have specific information about what `g1` contains, we only need to ensure that `g1` is not empty.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`g1` must be an iterable and contain at least one element**
