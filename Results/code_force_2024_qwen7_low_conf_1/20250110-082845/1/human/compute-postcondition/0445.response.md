The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the problem description, it should accept the following:

- `t`: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- An array `a` of length \(2n\), where each integer from 1 to \(n\) appears exactly twice.
- `n`: an integer satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
- `k`: an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor\).

Given the constraints and the need to return a specific value based on the input, we can describe the function's functionality as follows:

The function `func` accepts a positive integer `t`, an array `a` of length \(2n\) where each integer from 1 to \(n\) appears exactly twice, and two additional integers `n` and `k` satisfying the specified constraints. Based on these inputs, the function returns a specific value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t`, an array `a` of length \(2n\) where each integer from 1 to \(n\) appears exactly twice, and two integers `n` and `k` satisfying the specified constraints. The function returns a specific value based on these inputs.**
