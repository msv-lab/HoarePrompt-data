The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1. Given the initial state, `a` is a non-empty list, `occ[x]` is incremented by 1, and `x` is the next element in `a`. After executing the code, `occ[x]` will have its current value incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `occ[x]` is incremented by 1 (current value of `occ[x]` is now one more than before), and `x` is the next element in `a`**
