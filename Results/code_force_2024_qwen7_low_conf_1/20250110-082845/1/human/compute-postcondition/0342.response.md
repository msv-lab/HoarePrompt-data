Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `half` and each value is the count of that element in `half`; `singles` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear exactly once; `pairs` is the total number of elements in `half` that appear more than once; `found` is `True`; `ws` is equal to `prev_wanted_singles + 1`; `wp` is equal to `(k - (prev_wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`; `wanted_pairs` is equal to `(k - (prev_wanted_singles + 1)) // 2`. If `wanted_singles > singles`, then nothing changes. Since there is no else part, the conditions and values remain as they are after the if statement executes.***
