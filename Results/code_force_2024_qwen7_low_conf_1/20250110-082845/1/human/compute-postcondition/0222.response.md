The code `g1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g1`. Based on the initial state, `g1` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and may contain `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 1. Since the condition for `g1` is that it is empty when `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and since the initial state specifies that `occ[j]` is not equal to 0 if `j` is not `i + 1`, `occ[i + 1]` cannot be 0. Therefore, `occ[i + 1]` must be 1, making `g1` a non-empty list containing `i + 1`.

After appending `i` to `g1`, `g1` will now contain `i + 1` and `i`, making it `[i + 1, i]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and an empty list otherwise, `g1` is a list containing `[i + 1, i]` if `occ[i + 1]` is 1, and an empty list otherwise, `g2` is an empty list if `occ[i + 1]` is 0, and contains the key `i + 1` if `occ[i + 1]` is not 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
