`v` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `v` is now explicitly set to `0`, and this assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `v` and retains all other variables in their previous states.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1`, `k` is the original value of `k`, `v` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `a`.**
