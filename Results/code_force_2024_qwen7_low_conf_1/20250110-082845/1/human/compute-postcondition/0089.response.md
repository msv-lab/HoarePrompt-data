According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `g1`. The loop iterates over each element in `g1`. At the end of the last iteration, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `v` is an integer.
- `output` is a list.
- `g1` is a non-empty iterable.

The loop continues as long as `g1` is non-empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `g1` must still be a non-empty iterable.

Since the state does not provide specific values for `v` or `output` at the end of the previous iteration, we only need to ensure that `g1` is non-empty for the loop to continue.

State: **`v` is an integer, `output` is a list, and `g1` is a non-empty iterable**
