The code `g1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is a key from the dictionary `occ`) to the list `g1`. Since `i` is a key in `occ` and `occ[i]` is equal to 1, the value of `i` is added to `g1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the total number of times that element appears in `a`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is a list containing `i`, `g2` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and for every key `j` in `occ`, `occ[j]` is not equal to 0.**
