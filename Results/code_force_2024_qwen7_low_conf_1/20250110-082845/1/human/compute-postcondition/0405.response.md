`hp` is incremented by 1, and since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `hp`, we only know that it is incremented by 1. The precondition that `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary and the condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or nested structure (`if hp == wp`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is increased by 1, if `hp` equals `wp`, we break out of the most internal loop or nested structure.**
