### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the requirements specified in the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to find two arrays \( l \) and \( r \), each of length \( 2k \).
   - \( l \) must be a subset of the first \( n \) elements of the array \( a \).
   - \( r \) must be a subset of the last \( n \) elements of the array \( a \).
   - The bitwise XOR of elements in \( l \) must be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in \( r \).

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function categorizes integers into three groups based on their occurrences:
     - `g0`: Integers appearing 0 times.
     - `g1`: Integers appearing 1 time.
     - `g2`: Integers appearing more than 1 time.
   - It constructs the output strings by using elements from these groups without explicitly ensuring the bitwise XOR condition.

3. **Analysis of the Provided Program**:
   - The program does not explicitly compute the bitwise XOR of the elements in \( l \) and \( r \).
   - Instead, it categorizes the integers based on their occurrences and prints them out.
   - This approach does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in \( l \) will be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in \( r \).

To illustrate the issue, let's consider the provided test case:
- **Input**:
  ```
  2 1
  1 2 2 1
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  1 2
  2 1
  ```

This output is correct because:
- \( l = [1, 2] \) and \( r = [2, 1] \)
- \( 1 \oplus 2 = 3 \)
- \( 2 \oplus 1 = 3 \)

However, the provided program does not produce this output. Instead, it prints:
- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  1 2
  2 1
  ```

While this output looks correct, the program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in \( l \) and \( r \) are equal through a systematic approach. The program simply categorizes and prints elements without explicitly checking the bitwise XOR condition.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in \( l \) and \( r \) are equal. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

Final: **False**
