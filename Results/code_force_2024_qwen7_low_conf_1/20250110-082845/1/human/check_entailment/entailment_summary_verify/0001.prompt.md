You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then categorizes these integers into three groups based on their occurrences: `g0` for integers appearing 0 times, `g1` for integers appearing 1 time, and `g2` for integers appearing more than 1 time. Finally, it generates an output string for each group and prints it. Specifically, it ensures that the number of elements printed from each group does not exceed `k` while maintaining the required format.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n` and `k`, where `k` is doubled (`2 * k`) to match the problem statement.
3. The array `a` is read and processed to count occurrences of each integer from 1 to `n`.
4. The program categorizes the numbers into three lists: `g0` (numbers that occur 0 times), `g1` (numbers that occur 1 time), and `g2` (numbers that occur more than once).
5. The program constructs the output lists `l` and `r`:
   - It tries to use pairs from `g2` to fill the first `k` positions of both `l` and `r`.
   - If needed, it uses elements from `g1` to complete the lists.
   - It ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The XOR condition is not explicitly verified before printing the results.
- The program assumes that using pairs from `g2` will always satisfy the XOR condition, which might not be true if `g2` is empty or does not contain sufficient elements to form pairs that balance the XOR.
- The program does not ensure that the XOR of `l` and `r` are equal before outputting the results.

To verify correctness, we need to ensure that the constructed lists `l` and `r` have the same XOR value. Let's re-evaluate the solution:

```python
def calculate_xor(arr):
    xor_result = 0
    for num in arr:
        xor_result ^= num
    return xor_result

def construct_output(n, k, a):
    occ = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        occ[x] += 1
    
    g0, g1, g2 = [], [], []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if occ[i] == 0:
            g0.append(i)
        elif occ[i] == 1:
            g1.append(i)
        else:
            g2.append(i)
    
    l = []
    r = []
    v = 0
    for x in g2:
        if v < k:
            l.append(x)
            r.append(x)
            v += 2
    for x in g1:
        if v < k:
            if v % 2 == 0:
                l.append(x)
                v += 1
            else:
                r.append(x)
                v += 1
    
    # Ensure the XOR of l and r are equal
    while calculate_xor(l) != calculate_xor(r) and len(g0) > 0:
        l.append(g0.pop())
        r.append(g0.pop())
    
    return l, r

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        k = 2 * k
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l, r = construct_output(n, k, a)
        print(' '.join(map(str, l)))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r)))
```

With this updated logic, the program ensures that the XOR of `l` and `r` are equal before outputting the results. Therefore, the program is now correct.
