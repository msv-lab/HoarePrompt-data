Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the requirement to find two arrays `l` and `r` such that their bitwise XOR of elements are equal. Instead, the program seems to focus on using the values that appear once and twice in the array to construct `l` and `r`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` will be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
2 1
1 2 2 1
```
- Expected Output:
```
1 2
2 1
```
This output satisfies the condition that the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` are equal (`1 ^ 2 = 2 ^ 1 = 3`). However, the provided program does not generate such an output. Instead, it tries to use the values based on their occurrences, which does not necessarily meet the requirement.

The program should construct `l` and `r` such that the bitwise XOR of elements in both arrays are equal. The current implementation does not ensure this property, hence it is incorrect.
