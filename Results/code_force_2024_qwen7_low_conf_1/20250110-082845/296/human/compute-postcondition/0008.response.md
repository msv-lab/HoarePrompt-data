The code updates the variable `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`. Given the initial state:

- `arr` is a list of integers
- `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here` for `arr[2]`
- `x` is `arr[3]`

After executing the line `max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)`, the value of `max_ending_here` is updated based on the current value of `x`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here` for `arr[2]`, `x` is `arr[3]`, `max_ending_here` is the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`.**
