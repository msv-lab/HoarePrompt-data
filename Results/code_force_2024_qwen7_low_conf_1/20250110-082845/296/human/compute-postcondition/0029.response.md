Postcondition: ***`T` is decremented by 1, `a` is updated, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`, `max_subarray_sum` is determined by applying Kadane's algorithm to `a`. If `max_subarray_sum` is greater than 0, `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD`; otherwise, `result` is `initial_sum % MOD`. `results` is a list containing `result` and the updated `a`.***
