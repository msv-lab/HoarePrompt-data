The code updates the value of `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`. Given that `max_ending_here` was ready to be updated with the value of `arr[2]`, let's denote the value of `arr[2]` as `x`.

- Initially, `max_ending_here` is ready to be updated with `arr[2]`, which means `max_ending_here` holds the value of `arr[2]`.
- After the code runs, `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[2]` and `arr[2] + arr[2]`, which simplifies to the maximum of `arr[2]` and `2 * arr[2]`.

Since `2 * arr[2]` is always greater than `arr[2]` unless `arr[2]` is 0 (in which case they are equal), the value of `max_ending_here` will be `2 * arr[2]` if `arr[2]` is not 0, and `arr[2]` if `arr[2]` is 0.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`, `max_ending_here` is 2 * `arr[2]` if `arr[2]` is not 0, and `arr[2]` if `arr[2]` is 0.**
