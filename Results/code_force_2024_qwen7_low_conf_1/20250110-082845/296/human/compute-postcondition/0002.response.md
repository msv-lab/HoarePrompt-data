The code updates the value of `max_ending_here` to be the maximum between `x` (which is each element in the list `arr`) and `max_ending_here + x`. This means that `max_ending_here` will keep track of the maximum sum of subarrays ending at the current position. However, since the initial value of `max_ending_here` is `arr[0]` and the code does not specify which `x` is used, we need to consider the general case where `x` is an element from the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `max_ending_here` is `arr[0]`.
- `max_so_far` is `arr[0]`.

After executing the line `max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)` for each element `x` in `arr`, `max_ending_here` will be updated to be the maximum sum of subarrays ending at the current position.

Since the exact elements of `arr` are not specified, the output state will depend on the elements of `arr`. However, we can say that `max_ending_here` will be the maximum sum of contiguous subarrays ending at the current index.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `max_so_far` is `arr[0]`, `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum sum of subarrays ending at the current position for each element in `arr`.**
