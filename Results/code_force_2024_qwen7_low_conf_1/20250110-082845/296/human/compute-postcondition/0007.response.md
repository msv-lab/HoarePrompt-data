Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`.
     - `max_ending_here` is defined as:
       - \(2 \times arr[2]\) if \(arr[2]\) is not 0.
       - \(arr[2]\) if \(arr[2]\) is 0.
   - `max_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in arr[1:]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` starting from the second element (`arr[1]`).

4. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we are currently at the element `arr[2]` (since the loop starts from `arr[1]`).
   - For the next iteration, the loop will process `arr[3]`.

5. **Update the States:**
   - Since the loop is about to process the next element (`arr[3]`), the current `max_so_far` needs to be updated based on the new value of `max_ending_here` for the current element (`arr[2]`).
   - `max_ending_here` for the current element (`arr[2]`) is already calculated and stored in the state.
   - `max_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here` for `arr[2]`.

6. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - The list `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `max_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here` for `arr[2]`.
   - `x` in the next iteration will be `arr[3]`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here` for `arr[2]`.
- `x` is `arr[3]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here` for `arr[2]`, `x` is `arr[3]`**
