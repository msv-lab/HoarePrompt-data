The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. This operation does not change the values of any variables except adding `result` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Given the initial states:
- `T` is `T - 2`
- `a` is a new list of integers
- `index` is increased by `2 + int(data[index])`
- `n` is `int(data[index])`
- `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`
- `initial_sum` is `sum(a) % MOD`
- `max_subarray_sum` is the result of applying Kadane's algorithm to `a`
- `result` is either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum > 0` or `initial_sum % MOD` otherwise

Since no variable is reassigned or modified in this line of code, the only change is the addition of `result` to the `results` list.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 2`, `a` is a new list of integers, `index` is increased by `2 + int(data[index])`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `initial_sum` is `sum(a) % MOD`, `max_subarray_sum` is the result of applying Kadane's algorithm to `a`, `result` is either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum > 0` or `initial_sum % MOD` otherwise, `results` contains `[result]`**
