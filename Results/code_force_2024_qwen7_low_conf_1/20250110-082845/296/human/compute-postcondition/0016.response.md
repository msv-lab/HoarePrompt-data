Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by n, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`, `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` as calculated by Kadane's algorithm, and `max_subarray_sum` is less than or equal to 0**
