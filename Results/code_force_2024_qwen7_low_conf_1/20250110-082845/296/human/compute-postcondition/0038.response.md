Output State: **`T` is `T - 2`, `a` is a new list of integers, `index` is increased by 2 + `int(data[index])`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `initial_sum` is `(sum(a) % MOD)`, `max_subarray_sum` is the result of applying Kadane's algorithm to `a`, `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD`**
