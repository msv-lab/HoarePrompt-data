Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is the original index plus 2 + n, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`, `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` as calculated by Kadane's algorithm, `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`; otherwise, `result` is `initial_sum % MOD`, and `results` is a list containing `result`, `a` is updated, and `initial_sum` is calculated as `sum(a) % MOD`.**
