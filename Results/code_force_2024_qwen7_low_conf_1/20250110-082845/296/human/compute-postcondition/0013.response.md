Functionality: **The function `kadane` accepts a list of integers `arr` and computes the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the list. It iterates through the list while maintaining two variables: `max_ending_here`, which tracks the maximum subarray sum ending at the current position, and `max_so_far`, which keeps track of the overall maximum subarray sum encountered during the iteration. The function returns `max_so_far`, which represents the maximum subarray sum in the list. Potential edge cases include an empty list, where the function should return 0, and a list with all negative numbers, where the function should return the largest negative number.**
