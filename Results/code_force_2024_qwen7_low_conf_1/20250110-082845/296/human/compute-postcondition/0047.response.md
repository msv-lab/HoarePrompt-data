According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, the first element of `results` was printed. This means that the loop has processed at least one element from the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least two elements in the `results` list, and the loop will proceed to print the second element.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list that must have at least 2 elements, the second element of `results` is printed**
