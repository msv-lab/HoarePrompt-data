The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. This affects the value of `index`, but does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

- `T` is `T - 1`
- `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`
- `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`
- `index` is increased by `2`
- `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`
- `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` as calculated by Kadane's algorithm
- `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`; otherwise, `result` is `initial_sum % MOD`
- `results` is a list containing `result`

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`, `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` as calculated by Kadane's algorithm, `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`; otherwise, `result` is `initial_sum % MOD`, and `results` is a list containing `result`.**
