Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `arr` is a list of integers representing the sequence of prefix and suffix maximums indices.
- `max_ending_here` is initialized as `arr[0]`.
- `max_so_far` is also initialized as `arr[0]`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for x in arr[1:]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop starts iterating from `arr[1]` onwards because the loop runs over `arr[1:]`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `max_ending_here` is already set to `arr[0]`.
   - `max_so_far` is already set to `arr[0]`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `arr` must have at least one element after the first element (`arr[0]`).
   - This means `arr` must have more than one element.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `arr` has at least two elements to allow the loop to iterate over `arr[1:]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `max_ending_here` is `arr[0]`, `max_so_far` is `arr[0]`**
