The code prints the first element of the list `results`. However, the value of `results` itself does not change, and the print statement does not assign any new value to any variable. Therefore, the only impact is that the first element of `results` is printed, but `results` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list, the first element of `results` is printed.**
