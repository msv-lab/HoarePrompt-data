The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer representing the number of prefix maximums, and `a` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums. The function also considers another list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums, although this list is not provided in the function signature.

Based on the given information, the function does not return any specific value since no return statement is mentioned. However, based on the parameters and their descriptions, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer representing the number of prefix maximums, and `a` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums. The function also considers another list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums, although this list is not provided in the function signature.**
