Output State: **`T` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums for each iteration, `k` is an integer representing the number of prefix maximums for each iteration, `index` is the final position in the `data` list after processing all iterations, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD` for each iteration, `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` as calculated by Kadane's algorithm for each iteration, `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`; otherwise, `result` is `initial_sum % MOD` for each iteration, and `results` is a list containing all the `result` values.**
