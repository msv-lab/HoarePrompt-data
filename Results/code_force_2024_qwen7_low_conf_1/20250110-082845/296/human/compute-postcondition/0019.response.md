The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. However, this does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the only change is the addition of `result` to the `results` list.

The value of `result` is defined as `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`; otherwise, `result` is `initial_sum % MOD`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `T` is greater than 0,
- `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`,
- `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`,
- `index` is increased by `n`,
- `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`,
- `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` as calculated by Kadane's algorithm,
- `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`; otherwise, `result` is `initial_sum % MOD`.

The only thing that changes is the value of `results`, which now includes the `result` value.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by `n`, `initial_sum` is the sum of `a` modulo `MOD`, `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` as calculated by Kadane's algorithm, `result` is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`; otherwise, `result` is `initial_sum % MOD`, and `results` is a list containing `result`.**
