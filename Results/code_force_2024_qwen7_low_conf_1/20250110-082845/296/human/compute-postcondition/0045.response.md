According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over each element in `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a non-empty list, and the value of `result` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be a non-empty list, and it must contain at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet.

Since we don't know the exact number of elements in the list or the specific elements that have been processed, we only need to ensure that `results` remains a non-empty list.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list**
