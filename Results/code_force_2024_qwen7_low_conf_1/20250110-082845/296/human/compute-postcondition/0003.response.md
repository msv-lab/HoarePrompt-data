The code `max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)` updates the value of `max_so_far` to be the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`. The value of `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum sum of subarrays ending at the current position for each element in `arr`. However, since the exact values of `arr` and `max_ending_here` are not specified, we can only say that `max_so_far` is now the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`, `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum sum of subarrays ending at the current position for each element in `arr`.**
