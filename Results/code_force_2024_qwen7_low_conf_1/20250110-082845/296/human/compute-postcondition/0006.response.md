`max_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`. The value of `max_ending_here` is 2 * `arr[2]` if `arr[2]` is not 0, and `arr[2]` if `arr[2]` is 0. The previous value of `max_so_far` is either the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`, or just `max_ending_here` if no prior value existed. After executing the code, `max_so_far` is updated to reflect this maximum.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`, where `max_ending_here` is 2 * `arr[2]` if `arr[2]` is not 0, and `arr[2]` if `arr[2]` is 0; `max_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`.**
