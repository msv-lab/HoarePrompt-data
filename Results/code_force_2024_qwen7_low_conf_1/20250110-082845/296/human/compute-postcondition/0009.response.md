The code updates `max_so_far` to be the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`. Given the initial conditions, `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here` for `arr[2]`, and `x` is `arr[3]`. The new value of `max_so_far` will be the maximum of these two values.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here` for `arr[2]`, `x` is `arr[3]`, `max_ending_here` is the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`, `max_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.**
