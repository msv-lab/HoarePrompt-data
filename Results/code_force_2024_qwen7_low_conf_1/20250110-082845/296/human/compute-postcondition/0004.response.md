To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum sum of subarrays ending at the current position for each element in `arr`.

2. **Loop Statement Analysis:**
   ```python
   for x in arr[1:]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This means the loop iterates over each element in `arr` starting from the second element (index 1).

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` (which is `arr[1]`) has just been processed.
   - The next element to be processed is `arr[2]`.
   - `max_so_far` will remain the same as it was after the previous iteration since it is based on the values before the current iteration starts.
   - `max_ending_here` needs to be updated to consider the new element `arr[2]`.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the states as follows:

- `arr` remains the same list of integers.
- `max_so_far` remains the same as it was after the previous iteration.
- `max_ending_here` is now ready to be updated with the new value.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of its previous value and `max_ending_here`, `max_ending_here` is ready to be updated with the value of `arr[2]`**.
