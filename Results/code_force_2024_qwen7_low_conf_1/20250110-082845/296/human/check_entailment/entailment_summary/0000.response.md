Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of permutations that can satisfy given prefix and suffix maximum conditions.
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1()`**:
     - Reads input and splits it into multiple test cases.
     - For each test case, it calculates the sum of the given list \( a \).
     - It uses the `kadane` function to find the maximum subarray sum.
     - Depending on whether the maximum subarray sum is positive, it calculates the result using the initial sum and the maximum subarray sum, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - However, the calculation logic in `func_1()` does not align with the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, the problem asks for the number of valid permutations, but the code in `func_1()` attempts to calculate a sum-based value, which is incorrect.
   - **Function `kadane()`**:
     - Correctly implements Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum, which is not needed for solving the given problem. This function is not used correctly in the context of the problem.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would involve constructing the permutation based on the given prefix and suffix maximum indices and counting the number of valid permutations.
   - The number of valid permutations can be determined by placing the maximum elements in the correct positions and ensuring the constraints of prefix and suffix maximums are met.
   - Given the current implementation, it does not handle the construction and counting of valid permutations correctly.

Given that the provided code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
