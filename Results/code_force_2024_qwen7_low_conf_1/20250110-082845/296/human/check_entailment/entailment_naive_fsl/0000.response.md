Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `kadane` do not relate to the problem description at all. The problem requires determining the number of permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums, but the program attempts to solve a subarray sum maximization problem using Kadane's algorithm, which is irrelevant to the given task.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:
- \( n = 4 \), \( m_1 = 2 \), \( m_2 = 3 \)
- Prefix maximums: \( p_1 = 1 \), \( p_2 = 3 \)
- Suffix maximums: \( s_1 = 2 \), \( s_2 = 3 \), \( s_3 = 4 \)

According to the problem description, the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums must help in constructing valid permutations. However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `kadane` does not address this requirement and instead focuses on finding the maximum subarray sum, which is not relevant.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and hence is incorrect.
