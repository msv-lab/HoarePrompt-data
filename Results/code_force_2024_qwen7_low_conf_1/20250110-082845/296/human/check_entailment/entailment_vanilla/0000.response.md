Reasoning:
The provided program has two main functions: `func_1` and `kadane`. However, upon examining the code, it's clear that the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function incorrectly uses the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum, which is irrelevant for solving this problem. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of suitable permutations is missing.

The problem requires determining the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. To solve this, we should use the properties of prefix and suffix maximums rather than Kadane's algorithm.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from typing import List

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, m1, m2) = (int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2]))
        index += 3
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + m1]))
        index += m1
        s = list(map(int, data[index:index + m2]))
        index += m2

        # Find common indices between prefix and suffix maximums
        common_indices = sorted(set(p) & set(s))

        # If there are no common indices, there are no valid permutations
        if not common_indices:
            results.append(0)
            continue

        # Calculate the number of valid permutations
        count = 1
        prev = 0
        for i in range(len(common_indices)):
            current = common_indices[i]
            count *= (current - prev) * (n - current + 1)
            count %= MOD
            prev = current

        results.append(count)

    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_1()
```

In this corrected version:
- We read the input data and split it.
- We extract the necessary parameters and indices.
- We find the common indices between the prefix and suffix maximums.
- If there are no common indices, the result is 0.
- For each common index, we calculate the number of valid permutations using the formula derived from the properties of prefix and suffix maximums.
- Finally, we compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
