You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program has two main functions: `func_1` and `kadane`. However, upon examining the code, it's clear that the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function incorrectly uses the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum, which is irrelevant for solving this problem. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of suitable permutations is missing.

The problem requires determining the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. To solve this, we should use the properties of prefix and suffix maximums rather than Kadane's algorithm.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from typing import List

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, m1, m2) = (int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2]))
        index += 3
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + m1]))
        index += m1
        s = list(map(int, data[index:index + m2]))
        index += m2

        # Find common indices between prefix and suffix maximums
        common_indices = sorted(set(p) & set(s))

        # If there are no common indices, there are no valid permutations
        if not common_indices:
            results.append(0)
            continue

        # Calculate the number of valid permutations
        count = 1
        prev = 0
        for i in range(len(common_indices)):
            current = common_indices[i]
            count *= (current - prev) * (n - current + 1)
            count %= MOD
            prev = current

        results.append(count)

    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_1()
```

In this corrected version:
- We read the input data and split it.
- We extract the necessary parameters and indices.
- We find the common indices between the prefix and suffix maximums.
- If there are no common indices, the result is 0.
- For each common index, we calculate the number of valid permutations using the formula derived from the properties of prefix and suffix maximums.
- Finally, we compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
