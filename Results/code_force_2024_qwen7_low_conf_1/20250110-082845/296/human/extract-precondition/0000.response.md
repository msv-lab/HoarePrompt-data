Precondition: **arr is a list of integers representing the sequence of prefix and suffix maximums indices.** 

This precondition is not fully capturing the essence of the problem described, which involves permutations and their properties rather than a simple array processing. Given the context of the problem, the correct precondition should focus on the parameters related to the problem statement, such as the lengths and indices of prefix and suffix maximums. However, since the provided function `kadane` does not directly relate to those parameters, we will stick to describing the variables within the function itself.

If you intended to provide the precondition based on the actual problem's parameters (which are not utilized in the given function), it would look more like this:

Precondition: **t, n, m_1, m_2, p_1, ..., p_{m_1}, s_1, ..., s_{m_2} are integers where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sequences p_1, ..., p_{m_1} and s_1, ..., s_{m_2} are strictly increasing subsequences within the range [1, n].**
