n is an integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer representing the number of prefix maximums, and a is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums. Additionally, there is another list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums, which is not provided in the function signature but is part of the problem description.
