Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is an integer.
   - `group` is a list of integers containing its original elements plus `num`.
   - `placed` is a boolean that is `True` if `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`, otherwise it remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for group in groups:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each `group` in the `groups` list.
   - Each `group` is a list of integers.
   - The first element of each `group` is `num`.

4. **What Changes Need to be Made for the Next Iteration?**
   - For the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the next `group` in the `groups` list.
   - Since the loop is iterating over each `group`, the only thing that changes is the value of `group` itself.
   - `num` will be the first element of the next `group`.
   - `placed` remains unchanged unless `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True` within the loop body, but since we are only considering the state at the start of the next iteration, `placed` stays as it was from the previous iteration.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `num` will be the first element of the next `group`.
   - `group` will be the next `group` in the `groups` list.
   - `placed` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`num` is the first element of the next group in `groups`, `group` is the next group in `groups`, `placed` remains unchanged.**
