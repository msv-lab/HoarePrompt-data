The variable `placed` is reassigned to `True`. However, the value of `placed` was already `True`, so it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`; `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element, and one more element `num` has been added to one of the lists; `placed` is `True`; `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`.**
