The code prints the result of `func_2(n, integers)`. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided. Since the function's implementation is unknown, we cannot determine the exact output of `func_2(n, integers)`. But we can state the variables that have been updated or used.

- `n` remains an input integer.
- `integers` is a list of integers obtained by converting the split input of `user_input` to integers.
- `t` remains greater than 1, as no operation changes its value.

Since the exact result of `func_2(n, integers)` is unknown without knowing its implementation, we cannot specify a numerical value for the printed result. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of integers obtained by converting the split input of `user_input` to integers, and the result of `func_2(n, integers)` is printed.**
