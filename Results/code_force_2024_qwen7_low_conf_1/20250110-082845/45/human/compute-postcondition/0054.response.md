`num` is appended to the `group`. Since `group` was a list of lists and each contained at least one element, appending `num` to `group` means that `group` now contains another list with `num` as its first (and only) element. The state of `num` remains as the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` is still a list of lists with each containing at least one element, and `placed` remains `False`.

Output State: **`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`; `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element; `placed` is False; `group` is `[num]`**
