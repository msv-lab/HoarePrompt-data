The code `group.append(num)` appends the value of `num` to the list `group`. This changes the content of the `group` list. The `placed` variable remains unchanged and is still `True`. The `num` variable itself is not altered by this operation; it retains its original value.

Output State: **`num` is the first element of the next group in `groups`; `group` is the next group in `groups` with `num` appended; `placed` is True.**
