The code `placed = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `placed`. This does not affect the values of `num` or the list `group`. Therefore, the only change is that `placed` is now `True`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `group` is a list of integers containing its original elements plus `num`; `placed` is `True`.**
