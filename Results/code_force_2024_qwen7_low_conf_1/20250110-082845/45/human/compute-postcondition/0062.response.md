Postcondition: ***`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element and one additional element which is `num`, and `placed` is `True`. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to true, then we break out of the most internal loop or structure. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
