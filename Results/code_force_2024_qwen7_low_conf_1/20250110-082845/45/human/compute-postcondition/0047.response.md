Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`.
   - `groups` is a list of lists where the first list is `[num]` or updated based on `func_1(num, group[0])`.
   - `placed` is `False`.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each `group` in `groups`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one group in `groups`.

4. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop body will access elements within each `group`. Therefore, the loop needs to ensure that each `group` contains at least one element.
   - The loop should also account for the fact that `placed` is initially `False`. However, since the loop operates on `groups` and not directly on `placed`, `placed` being `False` does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

5. **Adjusted States**:
   - Since `groups` is a list of lists, for the loop to execute, `groups` must contain at least one list.
   - Each list in `groups` must contain at least one element (since `num` is the initial value in the first group).

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `groups` must have at least one list.
- Each list in `groups` must contain at least one element.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists that must have at least one list and each list must contain at least one element, and `placed` is `False`**.
