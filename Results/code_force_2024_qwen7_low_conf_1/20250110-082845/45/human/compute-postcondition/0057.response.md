Postcondition: ***`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element, and `placed` is True. If the function `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to true, then `group` becomes `[num]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
