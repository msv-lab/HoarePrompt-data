Postcondition: ***`num` is either no longer the next non-placed integer in `integers` and is now part of a new sublist `[num]` in `groups`, or the state remains unchanged with `num` as the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` as a list of lists with each containing at least one element, and `placed` remaining `False`.***
