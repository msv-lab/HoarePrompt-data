The code `integers = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in the list `integers`. The variable `n` remains unaffected, and the condition that `t` is greater than 1 still holds.

Let's denote the input as `user_input`, which will be split and converted to integers and stored in `integers`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of integers obtained by converting the split input of `user_input` to integers**
