According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Since `t` represents the integer value entered by the user, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
