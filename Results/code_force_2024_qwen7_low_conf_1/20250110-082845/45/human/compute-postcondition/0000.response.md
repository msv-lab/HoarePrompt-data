The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases. Since this is the only line of code executed, it affects only the value of `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.

After executing the code:
- `t` is now the integer value entered by the user, which is the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value entered by the user**
