The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `num` is being processed. The values of the other variables are not affected by the `break` statement. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`num` is the first element of the next group in `groups`, `group` is the next group in `groups` with `num` appended, `placed` is True.**
