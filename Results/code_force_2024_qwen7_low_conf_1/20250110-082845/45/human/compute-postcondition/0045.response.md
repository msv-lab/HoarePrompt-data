To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is the last non-placed integer in the list `integers`.
   - `groups` is a list of lists where the first list is `[num]`.
   - `placed` is `False` unless the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` is satisfied for the first list in `groups`, in which case `placed` becomes `True`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each integer in `integers`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - For each iteration, `num` changes to the next non-placed integer in `integers`.
   - `groups` is updated based on the condition `func_1(num, group[0])`.
   - `placed` is updated based on whether the condition is met.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `num` is the last non-placed integer at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `num` will be the next non-placed integer in `integers`.
   - `groups` will be updated to include this new `num` as part of its structure, depending on the outcome of `func_1(num, group[0])`.
   - `placed` will be updated to `True` if the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` is satisfied for the first list in `groups`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `num` should be the next non-placed integer in `integers`.
- `groups` should be updated to reflect the inclusion of the new `num` and the result of `func_1(num, group[0])`.
- `placed` should be updated to `True` if the condition is satisfied.

**State: **`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists where the first list is `[num]` or updated based on `func_1(num, group[0])`, and `placed` is `True` if the condition is satisfied.**
