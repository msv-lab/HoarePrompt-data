The code `placed = True` does not change the value of `placed`, but it reassigns it. Since the initial value of `placed` is `True`, the assignment does not alter its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`num` is the first element of the next group in `groups`; `group` is the next group in `groups` with `num` appended; `placed` is True.**
