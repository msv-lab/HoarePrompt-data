The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains greater than 0, and the list `integers` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `integers` is a list of integers obtained by converting the split input of `user_input` to integers**
