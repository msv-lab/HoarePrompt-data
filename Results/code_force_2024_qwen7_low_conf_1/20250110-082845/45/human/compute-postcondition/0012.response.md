The code snippet calls a function `func_2(n, integers)` with `n` and `integers` as arguments and prints the result. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code, so its behavior is unknown. Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact output or changes to the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an integer input from the user
- `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the user input

Since the function `func_2` is not defined, we cannot specify what the printed value is or how the variables are modified. Therefore, the only thing we can definitively say is that the function was called with the provided arguments and its result was printed.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, the function `func_2(n, integers)` was called and its result was printed.**
