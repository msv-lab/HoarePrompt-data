The code takes a list of integers from the user input using `input().split()` and then converts each element in the list to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This changes the value of the `integers` variable to a list of integers.

Since the initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0 and `n` is an integer input from the user, these variables are not directly affected by the provided code snippet. The `integers` variable is updated to hold the list of integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the user input**
