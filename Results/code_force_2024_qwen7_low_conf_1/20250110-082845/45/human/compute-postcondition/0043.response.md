`groups` is appended with a new list containing only the value of `num`. The value of `num` remains the same, and the value of `placed` remains `False`. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is the last non-placed integer in the list `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists where each list contains integers that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` for the respective `num`, and now the first list in `groups` is `[num]`, and `placed` is `False`.

Output State: **`num` is the last non-placed integer in the list `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists where the first list is `[num]`, and `placed` is `False`**
