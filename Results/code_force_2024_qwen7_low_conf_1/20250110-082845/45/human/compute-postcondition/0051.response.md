The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the `func_1(num, group[0])` was being evaluated. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, it only indicates that the loop or conditional block is exited. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`; `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element, and one more element `num` has been added to one of the lists; `placed` is `True`; `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`. The loop or conditional block is exited.**
