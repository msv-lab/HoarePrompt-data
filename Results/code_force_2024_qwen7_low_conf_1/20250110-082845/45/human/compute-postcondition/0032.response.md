`group` is a list that has the `num` appended to it. The `num` is the first element of the next group in `groups`. The variable `placed` remains unchanged. After appending `num` to `group`, the `group` now contains the original elements plus `num`.

Output State: **`num` is the first element of the next group in `groups`, `group` is the next group in `groups` with `num` appended, `placed` remains unchanged.**
