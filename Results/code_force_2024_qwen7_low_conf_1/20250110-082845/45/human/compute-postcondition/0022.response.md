Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31}\) for all \(0 \leq j < n\), `groups` is a list where each element is a list of integers that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` for the respective `num`, the list `groups` now contains a new list with `num` as its only element, `num` is the next non-placed element in the list `integers` starting from the first element, and `placed` is `True` if a group was found for the current `num`, otherwise `False` if no group could be found for the current `num`.***
