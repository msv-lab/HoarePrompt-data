`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains greater than 0 because no operations change its value. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
