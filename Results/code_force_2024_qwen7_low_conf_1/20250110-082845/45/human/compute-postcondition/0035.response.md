Postcondition: ***`num` is the first element of the next group in `groups`, `group` is the next group in `groups` with `num` appended, and `placed` is True.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not present and does not provide any additional information, the overall postcondition directly follows from the if part. The if condition ensures that `num` is appended to `group`, and `placed` is set to True.
