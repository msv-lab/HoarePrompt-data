The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or switch case. In this context, since there is no explicit loop or switch case, the state remains the same.

Output State: **`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element and one additional element which is `num`, and `placed` is `True`. We break out of the most internal loop or structure.**
