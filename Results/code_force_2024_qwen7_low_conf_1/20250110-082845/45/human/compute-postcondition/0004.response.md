The code prints the result of the function `func_2(n, integers)`, but since the definition of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value printed. However, we know that `n` is an input integer and `integers` is a list of integers created from the user's input. The `print` function does not assign a value to any variable, it only outputs the result.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of integers created from the user's input, the result of `func_2(n, integers)` is printed**
