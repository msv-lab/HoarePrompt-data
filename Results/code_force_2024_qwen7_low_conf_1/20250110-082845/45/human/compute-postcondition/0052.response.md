Postcondition: ***`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`, then `num` is added to one of the lists in `groups`, and `placed` is set to `True`. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `False`, the state remains unchanged: `num` remains the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` remains a list of lists with each containing at least one element, and `placed` remains `False`.***
