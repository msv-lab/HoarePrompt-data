Output State: **`integers` is an empty list, `groups` is a list of lists where each inner list contains one or more integers that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` for the respective `num`, and `num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`. If the loop did not execute, `integers` is the same list of `n` non-negative integers, `groups` is an empty list, and `num` is any integer from the initial list `integers`.**

### Explanation:
- **After All Iterations:**
  - The loop iterates over each `num` in `integers`. For each `num`, it tries to find a group in `groups` where `func_1(num, group[0])` is true. If such a group is found, `num` is appended to that group, and `placed` is set to `True`. If no such group is found, a new group is created with `num` as its only element, and `placed` remains `False`.
  - Since the loop processes all elements in `integers`, `integers` will eventually become an empty list as all elements are placed into the `groups`.
  - Each group in `groups` will contain one or more integers that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, group[0])`.

- **If the Loop Does Not Execute:**
  - If the list `integers` is empty, the loop will not execute. In this case, `integers` remains as the original list, `groups` remains an empty list, and `num` can be any integer from the initial list `integers` (since there are no elements to process).
