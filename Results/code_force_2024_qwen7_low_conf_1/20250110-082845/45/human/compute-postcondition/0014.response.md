The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function also accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of integers) and `integers` (a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\)).

Based on the provided information, the function will process `t` test cases, each consisting of `n` integers. The specific return value for each test case is not detailed, but given the constraints, it implies that the function processes a list of integers for each test case and likely returns some derived result from these integers. However, without further details on what the function does with these integers, we cannot specify the exact return type or value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `integers`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).**
