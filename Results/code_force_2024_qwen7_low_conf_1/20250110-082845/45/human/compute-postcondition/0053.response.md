Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`.
   - `groups` is a list of lists, with each containing at least one element.
   - `placed` is a boolean variable that determines if `num` has been placed in a group.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each `group` in `groups`.
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_1(num, group[0])` is evaluated.
   - If `func_1(num, group[0])` returns `True`, `num` is added to the group, and `placed` is set to `True`.
   - If `func_1(num, group[0])` returns `False`, the state remains unchanged.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `num` is still the next non-placed integer in `integers`.
   - `groups` remains a list of lists, with each containing at least one element.
   - `placed` is `False` because `num` was not placed in any group during the previous iteration.

4. **Next Iteration Considerations**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `placed` is still `False` (since the loop continues only if `placed` is `False`).
   - `num` should still be the next non-placed integer in `integers`.
   - `groups` should remain a list of lists with each containing at least one element.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`.
- `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element.
- `placed` remains `False`.

So, the final state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element, `placed` is False**.
