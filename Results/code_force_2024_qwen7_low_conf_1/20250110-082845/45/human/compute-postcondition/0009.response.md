According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, meaning there is at least one more iteration remaining.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since one iteration has already occurred), and it must still be greater than 0.

The state adjustments needed are:
- `t` is decremented by 1, making it greater than 0.
- `n` remains as the input integer.
- `integers` remains as the list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the user input.
- The result of `func_2(n, integers)` is not printed within the loop, so no additional state changes are required for this part.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of integers obtained by converting the split input of `user_input` to integers**
