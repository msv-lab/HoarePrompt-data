The code appends the value of `num` to the list `group`. Since `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to True in the initial state, `num` and `group[0]` must be related in a way that satisfies this condition. However, the exact nature of `func_1` is not specified, so we can only say that `num` is appended to `group`.

The value of `num` remains unchanged, and `group` now contains its original elements plus `num`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `group` is a list of integers containing its original elements plus `num`.**
