The code `break` does not change any variable values but breaks out of the current loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Given the initial state, the only change is that we break out of the loop or if statement.

Output State: **`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`; `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element; `placed` is True; `group` is `[num]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
