Output State: **`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists where each list contains at least one element, and `placed` is `True`. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True` for any group, `num` will be added to that group, and `placed` will be set to `True`. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `False` for all groups, the state remains unchanged: `num` remains the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` remains a list of lists with each containing at least one element, and `placed` remains `False`.**
