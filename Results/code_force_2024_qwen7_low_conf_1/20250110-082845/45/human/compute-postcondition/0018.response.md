Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31}\) for all \(0 \leq j < n\); `groups` is a list with either one additional element `num` appended to it; `num` is the first element in the list `integers`; `i` is 1; `placed` is `True` if `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`, otherwise `placed` is `False`; `group` now contains all elements from the original list plus the additional element `num`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
