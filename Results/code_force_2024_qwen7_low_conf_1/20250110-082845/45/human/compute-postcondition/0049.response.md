The code `group.append(num)` adds the value of `num` to the list `group`. According to the initial state, `num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`, `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element, and `placed` is `True`. Also, `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`.

After executing `group.append(num)`, the value of `num` remains the same (as it is added to `group`), and `groups` remains unchanged except for the addition of `num` to `group`. The variable `placed` is still `True`, and the function evaluation `func_1(num, group[0])` is still `True`.

Output State: **`num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`; `groups` is a list of lists with each containing at least one element, and one more element `num` has been added to one of the lists; `placed` is `True`; `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`.**
