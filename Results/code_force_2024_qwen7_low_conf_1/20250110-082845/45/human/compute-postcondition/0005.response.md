According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `integers` is a list of integers created from the user's input.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 because if `t` was exactly 1, it would have executed the current iteration and then `t` would become 0, ending the loop.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of integers created from the user's input**
