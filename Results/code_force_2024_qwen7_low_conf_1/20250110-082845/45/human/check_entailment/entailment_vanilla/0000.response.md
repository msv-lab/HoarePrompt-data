### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Function `func_1(x, y)`**: This function checks whether two numbers `x` and `y` have different bits in the 1st to 31st positions.
   - It iterates through each bit position from 1 to 31.
   - For each bit position `i`, it checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` and `y` are the same using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) and right shift (`>>`).
   - If any bit is the same, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, integers)`**: This function groups the integers such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 1st to 31st positions.
   - It initializes an empty list `groups` to store the groups.
   - For each number in the list of integers:
     - It tries to place the number in an existing group where no two numbers have matching bits in the specified positions.
     - If a suitable group is found, it appends the number to that group and marks it as placed.
     - If no suitable group is found, it creates a new group with the current number.
   - Finally, it returns the number of groups required.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: This function handles the input and calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers.
   - It prints the result of calling `func_2` for the current test case.

### Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic correctly checks if any two numbers have matching bits in the 1st to 31st positions.
   - This ensures that if `func_1(x, y)` returns `True`, `x` and `y` are eligible to be in the same group.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The logic for grouping the numbers is correct. It ensures that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.
   - It handles both placing a number in an existing group and creating a new group when necessary.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The input handling and the call to `func_2` are correct. It processes each test case appropriately.

Given that the logic in each function appears to be correct and the functions are called in a manner that aligns with the problem requirements, the provided code should work as intended.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness is:

**Correctness: **True**
