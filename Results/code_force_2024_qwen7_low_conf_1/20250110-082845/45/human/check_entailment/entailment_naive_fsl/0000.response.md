Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to divide the numbers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. 

- `func_1` checks whether two numbers have any matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit.
- `func_2` uses this function to group the numbers. It iterates through each number and tries to place it in an existing group that satisfies the condition. If no such group exists, it creates a new group.
- `func_3` handles the input and output as per the problem description.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the bit comparison, the implementation appears to cover all necessary cases without any apparent issues. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the solution. Therefore, the program works correctly for all described scenarios.
