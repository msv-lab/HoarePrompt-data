### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the given function summaries against the problem description.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to divide the numbers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit at any position from 1st to 31st bit.
   - The key requirement is to check if two numbers have the same bit at a specific position using `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if two numbers `x` and `y` have the same bit at any position from 1 to 31.
   - It iterates from 1 to 31 and compares the bits at each position.
   - If the bits at any position are the same, it returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function groups the numbers such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit at any position.
   - It initializes an empty list of groups.
   - For each number, it tries to place it in an existing group that satisfies the condition.
   - If no suitable group is found, it creates a new group.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `n` integers.
   - It then calls `func_2` with these inputs and prints the result.

### Analysis of the Code and Function Summaries

- **Function `func_1`**: The logic seems correct for checking if two numbers have the same bit at any position.
- **Function `func_2`**: The logic seems correct for grouping the numbers based on the condition.
- **Function `func_3`**: The logic seems correct for handling multiple test cases and calling `func_2` appropriately.

However, let's consider some potential edge cases and test cases to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Edge Cases and Test Cases

1. **All numbers are the same**: If all numbers are the same, they should all be in different groups because they will always have the same bit at every position.
2. **Numbers with the same bit at all positions**: If all numbers have the same bit at every position, they should be in separate groups.
3. **Numbers with different bits at different positions**: The function should handle these cases correctly by ensuring no two numbers in the same group have the same bit at any position.

Given the function summaries and the provided test cases, the implementation appears to cover all necessary cases without any apparent issues. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis and the provided test cases, the program correctly implements the logic to divide the numbers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit.

**Final: True**
