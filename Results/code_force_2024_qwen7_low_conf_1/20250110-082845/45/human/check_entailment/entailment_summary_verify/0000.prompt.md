You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    for i in range(1, 32):
        if x >> i - 1 & 1 == y >> i - 1 & 1:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, integers):
    groups = []
    for num in integers:
        placed = False
        for group in groups:
            if func_1(num, group[0]):
                group.append(num)
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            groups.append([num])
    return len(groups)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        integers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(func_2(n, integers))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3()` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers (each less than \(2^{31}\)) from standard input. It then calls the function `func_2(n, integers)` with these inputs and prints the result of `func_2`. If there are `t` test cases, the function will process `t` such sets of inputs. The function does not modify the input parameters; it only reads them and uses them to call `func_2`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `t`, `n`, or the integers themselves do not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `t` or `n` being zero, negative, or very large, or integers exceeding \(2^{31}-1\)). If any of these constraints are violated, the behavior is undefined, but the function will continue processing other valid test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to divide the numbers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. 

- `func_1` checks whether two numbers have any matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit.
- `func_2` uses this function to group the numbers. It iterates through each number and tries to place it in an existing group that satisfies the condition. If no such group exists, it creates a new group.
- `func_3` handles the input and output as per the problem description.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the bit comparison, the implementation appears to cover all necessary cases without any apparent issues. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the solution. Therefore, the program works correctly for all described scenarios.
