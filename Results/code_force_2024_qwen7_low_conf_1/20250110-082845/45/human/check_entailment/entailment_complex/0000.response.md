### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks whether two integers `x` and `y` have any matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. It returns `True` if all bits differ and `False` if any bit matches.
   - The function iterates through each bit position from 1 to 31 and compares the corresponding bits using bitwise operations (`>>` and `&`). This ensures that the function works correctly for all valid inputs within the range \(0 \leq x, y < 2^{31}\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly groups the integers based on the condition defined by `func_1`. It ensures that no two integers in the same group have matching bits in the specified positions.
   - The function uses a list of lists (`groups`) to store the groups of integers. For each integer `num`, it tries to add it to an existing group where the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` holds. If it cannot be added to any existing group, a new group is created.
   - The function returns the number of groups needed, which is the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function correctly processes multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers. It then calls `func_2(n, integers)` to determine the minimum number of groups needed and prints the result.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output as per the problem statement. It ensures that the input constraints are respected and processes each test case appropriately.

### Overall:
- All functions are implemented correctly and handle the problem requirements accurately.
- The logic for grouping integers and checking the bit conditions is sound and adheres to the problem statement.
- The overall structure of the program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the required output.

### Conclusion:
Since all functions together correctly implement the solution to the given problem and handle the constraints properly, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
