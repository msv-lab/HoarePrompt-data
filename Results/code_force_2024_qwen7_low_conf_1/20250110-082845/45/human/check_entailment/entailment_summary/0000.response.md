Reasoning:
1. **func_1**: This function correctly checks whether two numbers have different bits in every position from 1 to 31. It iterates through each bit position, compares the bits, and returns `True` if the bits differ in any position. This is essential for ensuring that the condition for forming groups is met.

2. **func_2**: This function correctly implements the logic to form groups based on the `func_1` condition. It tries to add each number to an existing group that satisfies the condition. If no such group exists, it creates a new group. This ensures that the final number of groups is minimized while satisfying the requirement that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any of the 31 least significant bits.

3. **func_3**: This function handles the input and output format as specified. It reads the number of test cases (`t`), processes each test case by reading `n` and the list of integers, and then prints the result of calling `func_2` for each test case. It correctly follows the input and output specifications.

Given that all functions work as intended and collectively meet the requirements of the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
