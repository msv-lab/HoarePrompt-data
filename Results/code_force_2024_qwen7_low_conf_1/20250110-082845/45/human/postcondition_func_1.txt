The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)) and a list `integers` (a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\)). It processes the list `integers` by grouping its elements into sublists based on a condition defined by the function `func_1`. Specifically, for each element `num` in `integers`, it checks if `num` can be added to any existing sublist in `groups` according to the condition `func_1(num, group[0])`. If `num` satisfies the condition with an existing group, it is appended to that group; otherwise, a new group is created for `num`. After processing all elements, the function returns the total number of sublists (or groups) formed.
