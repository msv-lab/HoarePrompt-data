#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers less than \(2^{31}\), and the function checks if any two numbers do not have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit.
def func_1(x, y):
    for i in range(1, 32):
        if x >> i - 1 & 1 == y >> i - 1 & 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{31}\), `y` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{31}\), and the function returns False if all bits from the 1st to the 31st bit in `x` and `y` match. Otherwise, the function returns True.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers less than \(2^{31}\). It iterates through each bit position from the 1st to the 31st bit and checks if the corresponding bits in `x` and `y` are the same. If all bits match, the function returns `False`. If at least one bit differs, the function returns `True`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that are not covered by the actual code. The function correctly implements the described behavior and handles all possible inputs within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and integers is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^{31} for all 0 ≤ j < n.
def func_2(n, integers):
    groups = []
    for num in integers:
        placed = False
        
        for group in groups:
            if func_1(num, group[0]):
                group.append(num)
                placed = True
                break
        
        if not placed:
            groups.append([num])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `integers` is an empty list, `groups` is a list of lists where each inner list contains one or more integers that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` for the respective `num`, and `num` is the next non-placed integer in `integers`. If the loop did not execute, `integers` is the same list of `n` non-negative integers, `groups` is an empty list, and `num` is any integer from the initial list `integers`.
    return len(groups)
    #The program returns the length of the list `groups`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)) and a list `integers` (a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\)). It processes the list `integers` by grouping its elements into sublists based on a condition defined by the function `func_1`. Specifically, for each element `num` in `integers`, it checks if `num` can be added to any existing sublist in `groups` according to the condition `func_1(num, group[0])`. If `num` satisfies the condition with an existing group, it is appended to that group; otherwise, a new group is created for `num`. After processing all elements, the function returns the total number of sublists (or groups) formed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and integers is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        integers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(func_2(n, integers))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the user for each iteration, `integers` is a list of integers for each iteration, the function `func_2(n, integers)` is called for each iteration and its result is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers (each less than \(2^{31}\)) from standard input. It then calls the function `func_2(n, integers)` with these inputs and prints the result of `func_2`. If there are `t` test cases, the function will process `t` such sets of inputs. The function does not modify the input parameters; it only reads them and uses them to call `func_2`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `t`, `n`, or the integers themselves do not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `t` or `n` being zero, negative, or very large, or integers exceeding \(2^{31}-1\)). If any of these constraints are violated, the behavior is undefined, but the function will continue processing other valid test cases.
