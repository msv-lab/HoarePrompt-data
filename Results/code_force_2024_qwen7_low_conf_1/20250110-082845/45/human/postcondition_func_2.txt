The function `func_3()` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers (each less than \(2^{31}\)) from standard input. It then calls the function `func_2(n, integers)` with these inputs and prints the result of `func_2`. If there are `t` test cases, the function will process `t` such sets of inputs. The function does not modify the input parameters; it only reads them and uses them to call `func_2`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `t`, `n`, or the integers themselves do not meet the specified constraints (e.g., `t` or `n` being zero, negative, or very large, or integers exceeding \(2^{31}-1\)). If any of these constraints are violated, the behavior is undefined, but the function will continue processing other valid test cases.
