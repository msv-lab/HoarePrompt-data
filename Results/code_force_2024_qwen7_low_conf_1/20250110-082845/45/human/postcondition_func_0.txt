The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both non-negative integers less than \(2^{31}\). It iterates through each bit position from the 1st to the 31st bit and checks if the corresponding bits in `x` and `y` are the same. If all bits match, the function returns `False`. If at least one bit differs, the function returns `True`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that are not covered by the actual code. The function correctly implements the described behavior and handles all possible inputs within the specified range.
