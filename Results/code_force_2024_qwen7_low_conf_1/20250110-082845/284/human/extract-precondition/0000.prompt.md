You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: The only difference between this and the hard version is that all a_{i} are
even.

After some recent attacks on Hogwarts Castle by the Death Eaters, the Order of
the Phoenix has decided to station n members in Hogsmead Village. The houses
will be situated on a picturesque n\times n square field. Each wizard will
have their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house
will take up the space of one square.

However, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the
weekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0
\leq a_{i} \leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are
built horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},
y_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -
y_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit
another wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built
will be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.

Apart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle
in the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other
wizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each
column of the n\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i
-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \neq x_{j} for all i
\neq j .

The Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses
in such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n
wizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.

If it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard
there is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard
is the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each
wizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the
weekends.

If it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.

Input

The first line contains n (2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses
to be built.

The second line contains n integers a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n} (0 \leq a_{i} \leq n)
. All a_{i} are even.

Output

If there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,
output NO.

If the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.

The next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \leq x_{i},
y_{i} \leq n for each wizard.

The i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the
house of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If
there are multiple such wizards, you can output any.

If there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.

Example

Input

    4
    0 4 2 4

Output

    YES
    4 4
    1 3
    2 4
    3 1
    1 1 1 3

Note

For the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd
at (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .

The distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .

The distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .

The distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .

The distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard
is |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .

The view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the
placement is correct.
