The `houses` list initially contains the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`. The code appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the `houses` list. Given that `x` is 3 and `y` is 2, the new tuple to be appended is `(3, 2)`. After appending this tuple, the `houses` list will contain three elements: `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(3, 2)`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 2, `x` is 3, `houses` is a list containing the tuples `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(3, 2)`**
