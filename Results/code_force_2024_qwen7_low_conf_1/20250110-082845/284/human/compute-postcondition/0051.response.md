The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block context provided in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program would exit the current loop or conditional structure.

Given the initial state and the lack of additional context to indicate what loop or conditional block the `break` statement is part of, the variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`j` is from 0 to n-1, `i` is n, `visits[i]` is `j + 1`, `i` is not equal to `j`, and `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, which is equal to `a[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
