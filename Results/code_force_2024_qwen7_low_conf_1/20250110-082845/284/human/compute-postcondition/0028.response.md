The code updates the value of `visits[i]` to `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 0, and `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[n-1]` and `houses[0]`. Since `j` is 0, `visits[i]` will be updated to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

After the code execution, the following changes occur:
- `visits[i]` is now `1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `j` is 0, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[n-1]` and `houses[0]`, and `visits[i]` is 1.**
