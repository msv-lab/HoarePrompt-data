The line `input = sys.stdin.read` does not modify any existing variables or perform any operations. Instead, it reassigns the built-in `input` function to the method `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from standard input as a single string. This does not change the values of the variables `n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are even integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; the built-in `input` function is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`.**
