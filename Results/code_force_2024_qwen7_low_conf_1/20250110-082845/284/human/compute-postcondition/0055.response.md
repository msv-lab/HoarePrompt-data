`dist` is assigned the value of the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. Given that `j` is 0, `dist` is calculated as `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[0][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[0][1])`. The values of `i` and `visits[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is \( n \), `visits[i]` remains unchanged, `dist` is \( abs(houses[i][0] - houses[0][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[0][1]) \)**
