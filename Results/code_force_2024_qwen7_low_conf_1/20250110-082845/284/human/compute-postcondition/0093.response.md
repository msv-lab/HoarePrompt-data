The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This operation does not affect any variable values. Therefore, the only change is the printed output, but since the output state is focused on the values of the variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `j` is an integer from 0 to `n-1`, `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the index of the house in `houses` whose Manhattan distance to the corresponding house in `houses` equals `a[i]` (if such a house exists) or `-1` (if no such house exists), and we print 'YES' to the console.**
