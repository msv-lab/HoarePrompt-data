Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `y` is `n`
- `x` is `n`
- `houses` is a list containing `n` tuples, each of the form `(i+1, i+1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`
- `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`

### Analysis:
The for loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

#### Initial State:
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- The loop will check if `i` is less than `n` (the condition for the loop).

Since `i` starts at `n-1` and the loop iterates while `i < n`, the loop will only execute once, with `i` being `n-1`.

### States to Adjust:
- Since the loop will only execute once (with `i` being `n-1`), there is no need to adjust the initial value of `i`.
- The other variables (`n`, `y`, `x`, `houses`, `visits`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop executes or not. They remain as they are.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop will execute exactly once with `i` being `n-1`, the only thing that needs to be ensured is that `n` is within the specified range and that the loop condition `i < n` holds true for the single iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute exactly once, with `i` starting at `n-1` and ending the loop after one iteration.
