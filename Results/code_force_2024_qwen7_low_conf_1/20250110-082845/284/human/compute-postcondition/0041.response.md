The code `break` is used to exit the current loop or the most internal block it is in. Since there is no loop or block context provided, it only indicates that the execution would break out of the most internal loop or block it was in. However, the variables `i`, `j`, `dist`, and `visits[i]` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-1 \), `j` is 2, `dist` is \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \); `visits[i]` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or block.**
