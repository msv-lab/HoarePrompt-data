Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( i \) is \( n-1 \)
   - \( n \) is in the range \( 2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)
   - \( j \) is 0
   - \( visits[i] \) is 1 if the Manhattan distance between \( houses[n-1] \) and \( houses[0] \) equals \( a[i] \); otherwise, no change occurs.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop:**
   - The loop variable \( j \) iterates from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( j \) is 0.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( j \) needs to be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of \( j \) will be 1.
   - The values of \( i \) and \( n \) do not change within the loop as they are not modified in the given information.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - \( i \) remains \( n-1 \)
   - \( n \) remains in the range \( 2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)
   - \( j \) becomes 1
   - The condition for \( visits[i] \) does not change since it is based on the initial state and the loop variable \( j \) does not affect this condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `j` is 1, and `visits[i]` is 1 if the Manhattan distance between `houses[n-1]` and `houses[0]` equals `a[i]`; otherwise, no change occurs.**
