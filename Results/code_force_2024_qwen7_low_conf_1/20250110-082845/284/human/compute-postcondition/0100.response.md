Output State: **`houses` is a non-empty list, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `j` is an integer from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the index of the house in `houses` whose Manhattan distance to the corresponding house in `houses` equals `a[i]` (if such a house exists) or `-1` (if no such house exists).
   - We print 'YES' to the console.

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for x, y in houses:
       print(x, y)
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the `houses` list.
   - For each iteration, it prints the values of `x` and `y`.

4. **Output State After the Loop Executes:**
   - The loop prints the coordinates of each house in `houses`.
   - Since the loop only depends on the `houses` list and does not modify any of its elements or introduce new variables that affect the final state, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged after the loop completes.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of how many times the loop executes (as long as `houses` is a non-empty list), the values of `x` and `y` remain the same as they were when the loop started.
   - Therefore, the final output state of the loop is that `houses` is a non-empty list, and `x` and `y` are unchanged.
