Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `j` is an integer from 0 to `n-1`, `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the index of the house in `houses` whose Manhattan distance to the corresponding house in `houses` equals `a[i]` (if such a house exists) or `-1` (if no such house exists).**

Explanation:
- The outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each `i`, the inner loop checks all possible `j` (from `0` to `n-1`) to find if there is a house `houses[j]` such that the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`.
- If such a house is found, `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1`.
- If no such house is found, `visits[i]` remains `-1`.

After all iterations, every `visits[i]` will either be the correct index of a house or remain `-1` if no matching house is found. The value of `i` will be `n` after the outer loop completes, and `j` will be the last index that was checked in the loop.
