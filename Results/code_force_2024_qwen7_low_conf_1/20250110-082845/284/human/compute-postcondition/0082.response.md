Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `visits[0]` either remains unchanged (which could be any value) or is set to 2 based on whether the Manhattan distance between `houses[0]` and `houses[1]` equals `a[0]`.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)` starting from `j = 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently 1, the loop condition `j < n` needs to be satisfied for the loop to continue.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - To enter the next iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `j = 2`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 because `j` starts from 1 and needs to be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `j` changes from 1 to 2.
   - `visits[0]` remains unchanged or could still be set to 2 based on the same condition as before (the Manhattan distance between `houses[0]` and `houses[1]` equals `a[0]`).

Based on this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `visits[0]` either remains unchanged or is set to 2 based on whether the Manhattan distance between `houses[0]` and `houses[1]` equals `a[0]`**
