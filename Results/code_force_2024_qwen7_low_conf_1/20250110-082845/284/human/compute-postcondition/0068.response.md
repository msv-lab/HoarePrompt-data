State before the loop starts: `j` is any integer from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 0, and `visits[i]` contains the correct index of a house if the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`. If no such house is found, `visits[i]` remains unchanged.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from 0 to `n-1`.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

1. `j` must be within the range from 0 to `n-1`.
2. `i` is already given as 0.
3. `visits[i]` must contain the correct index of a house if the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`. If no such house is found, `visits[i]` remains unchanged.

However, since `i` is fixed at 0, we only need to ensure that `visits[0]` meets the condition when the loop runs. But since we are setting up the initial state for the loop, we only need to ensure that `j` is valid.

State: **`j` must be within the range from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 0, and `visits[0]` must either contain the correct index of a house or remain unchanged based on the condition that the Manhattan distance between `houses[0]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[0]`.**
