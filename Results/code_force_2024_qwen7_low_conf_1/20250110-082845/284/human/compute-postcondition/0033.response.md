The code calculates the Manhattan distance between two points `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. Initially, `j` is set to 1. The distance is calculated using the formula `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` remains \( n-1 \)
- \( n \) remains in the range \( 2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)
- \( j \) becomes 1
- The condition for `visits[i]` does not change

After executing the line of code, the value of `j` is updated to 1, and the distance is computed using the coordinates of `houses[i]` and `houses[1]`.

Output State: **`i` remains \( n-1 \), `j` is 1, `dist` is \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \)**
