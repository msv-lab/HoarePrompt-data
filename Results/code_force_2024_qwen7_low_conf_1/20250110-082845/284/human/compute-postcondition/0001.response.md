The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from `sys.stdin.read` (which is the reassigned `input` function) and splits it into a list of strings. This operation affects the `data` variable by assigning it the split result. The initial values of `n` and the list of even integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are even integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string from `sys.stdin.read`.**
