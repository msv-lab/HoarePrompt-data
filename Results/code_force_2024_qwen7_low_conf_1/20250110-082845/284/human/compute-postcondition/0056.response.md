The code `visits[i] = j + 1` updates the value of `visits[i]` to `j + 1`. Given the initial state where `j` is 0 and `i` is \( n \), the value of `visits[i]` will be updated to `0 + 1`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is \( n \), `visits[i]` is 1, `dist` is \( abs(houses[i][0] - houses[0][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[0][1]) \)**
