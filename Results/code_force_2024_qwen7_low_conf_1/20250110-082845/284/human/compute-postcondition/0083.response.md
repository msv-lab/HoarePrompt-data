The code calculates the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the distance is calculated as the absolute difference in the x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in the y-coordinates between `houses[0]` and `houses[1]`. However, the value of `dist` is not assigned to any variable in the given code snippet, so it does not affect any other variables. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `visits[0]` either remains unchanged or is set to 2 based on whether the Manhattan distance between `houses[0]` and `houses[1]` equals `a[0]`.**
