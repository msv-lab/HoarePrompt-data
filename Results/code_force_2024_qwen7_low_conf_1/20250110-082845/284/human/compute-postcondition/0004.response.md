Postcondition: **`n` is an integer with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are even integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string from `sys.stdin.read`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data[1:]` to integers; there exists at least one element in `a` such that the element is greater than 2 * (n - 1)**
