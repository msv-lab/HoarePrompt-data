The code `print(x, y)` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are not defined in the given code snippet, they remain unchanged from their initial values in the precondition. The output of the print statement will be `None` because neither `x` nor `y` have been assigned any values.

Output State: **`houses` is a non-empty list, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged**
