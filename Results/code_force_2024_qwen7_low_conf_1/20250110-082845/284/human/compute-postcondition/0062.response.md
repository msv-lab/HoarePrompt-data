`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1 and `i` is `n`, the value of `visits[i]` becomes `1 + 1`, which is 2. The states of the other variables (`j`, `i`, `visits[i]`, `dist`) are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n`, `visits[i]` is 2, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[n]` and `houses[1]`**
