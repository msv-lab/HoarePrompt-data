Functionality: **The function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, checks if it's possible to visit all houses in a specific order based on given distances, and prints 'YES' along with the visiting order and the distances between consecutive houses if possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and returns `None`.

1. It first reads the input, which consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` even integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It ensures that these integers meet certain constraints: `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `0 ≤ a_i ≤ n`.
2. It then constructs a list of houses with coordinates `(i+1, i+1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
3. For each house, it tries to find another house whose Manhattan distance to the current house matches the corresponding `a_i` value. If such a house is found, it records the index of this house in the `visits` list. If no such house is found for any `a_i`, it prints 'NO'.
4. If all `a_i` values are matched, it prints 'YES', the list of house coordinates, and the visiting order (as indices in the `visits` list).

Potential edge cases:
- If any `a_i` value exceeds `2 * (n - 1)`, the function immediately prints 'NO' and returns, as it violates the problem constraints.
- If no valid visiting order can be determined, the function prints 'NO'.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where multiple valid visiting orders exist. It only checks for the existence of a valid visiting order and prints the first one it finds.**

This summary covers the entire functionality of the function, including its input constraints, the actions it performs, and the potential edge cases and missing functionality.
