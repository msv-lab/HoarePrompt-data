The code updates the value of `dist` to be the Manhattan distance between the points `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. Given the initial state where `j` is 1, `i` is `n`, and `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[n]` and `houses[0]`, the new value of `dist` will be the Manhattan distance between `houses[n]` and `houses[1]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `j` is 1 (unchanged)
- `i` is `n` (unchanged)
- `visits[i]` remains unchanged (unchanged)
- `dist` is now the Manhattan distance between `houses[n]` and `houses[1]`

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n`, `visits[i]` remains unchanged, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[n]` and `houses[1]`**
