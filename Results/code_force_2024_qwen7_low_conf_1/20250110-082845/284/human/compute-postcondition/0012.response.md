The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `houses`. Since the values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, they are assumed to be the current values of `x` and `y` at the time of execution. The initial state does not provide specific values for `x`, but we know that `y` is 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 1, `houses` is a list containing the tuple `(x, 1)`**
