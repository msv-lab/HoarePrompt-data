The `break` statement does not modify any variable values; it only causes the immediate exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `dist` is abs(houses[0][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[0][1] - houses[1][1]), `visits[0]` is 2**
