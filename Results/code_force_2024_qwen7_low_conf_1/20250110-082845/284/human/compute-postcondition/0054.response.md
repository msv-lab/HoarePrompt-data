Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - `i` is \( n \).
   - `visits[i]` contains the correct index if a house is found (i.e., the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`). If no such house is found, `visits[i]` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - For each value of `j`, the loop body (which is currently omitted) checks if there is a house such that the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`.
   - If such a house is found, `visits[i]` is updated with the index of the found house.
   - If no such house is found, `visits[i]` remains unchanged.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` from 0 to \( n-1 \), it means that the current value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is \( n-1 \).
   - The loop will continue if `j` is less than \( n \). Therefore, the next value of `j` should be \( 0 \) (as it wraps around).

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `j` will start from 0 in the next iteration.
   - `i` remains \( n \) as the loop variable `j` does not affect `i`.
   - `visits[i]` remains unchanged because the loop has not yet checked for a match, and since `j` starts from 0, the condition for updating `visits[i]` is not yet met.

6. **Final State:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `i` is \( n \).
   - `visits[i]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 0, `i` is \( n \), and `visits[i]` remains unchanged**.
