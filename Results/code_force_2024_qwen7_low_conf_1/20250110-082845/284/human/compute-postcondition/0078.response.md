The code `visits[i] = j + 1` updates the value of `visits[i]` to `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Therefore, `visits[i]` (which is `visits[0]`) will be updated to `1 + 1`, which is 2.

Other variables remain unaffected by this code. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `dist` is abs(houses[0][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[0][1] - houses[1][1]), `visits[0]` is 2**
