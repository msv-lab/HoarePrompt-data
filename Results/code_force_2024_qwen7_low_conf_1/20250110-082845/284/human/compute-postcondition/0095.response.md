The code `print(x, y)` is executed, but the variables `x` and `y` are not defined or updated in the given snippet. Therefore, the print statement will raise a NameError because `x` and `y` are not defined. Since no variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`houses` is a non-empty list**
