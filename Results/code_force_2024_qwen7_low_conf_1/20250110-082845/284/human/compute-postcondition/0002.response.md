`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`. This means `n` is converted from the first element in the list `data` to an integer. The values of `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are even integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string from `sys.stdin.read`.**
