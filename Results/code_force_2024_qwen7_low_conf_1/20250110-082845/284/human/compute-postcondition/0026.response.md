`dist` is assigned the value of the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. The Manhattan distance is calculated as the absolute difference in the x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in the y-coordinates. Since `i` is `n-1` and `j` is 0, these values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `j` is 0, and `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[n-1]` and `houses[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `j` is 0, and `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[n-1]` and `houses[0]`.**
