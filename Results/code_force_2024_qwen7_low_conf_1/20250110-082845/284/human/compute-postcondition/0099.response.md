The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. However, the values of `x` and `y` are not changed by this code. The `houses` list remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`houses` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged**
