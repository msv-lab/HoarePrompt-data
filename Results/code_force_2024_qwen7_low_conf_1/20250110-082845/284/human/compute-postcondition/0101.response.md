The code `print(' '.join(map(str, visits)))` does the following:
1. It applies the `map` function to the `visits` list, converting each element in `visits` to a string.
2. It then joins these string elements with a space (' ') as the separator.
3. Finally, it prints the resulting string.

Since the initial state includes `houses` being a non-empty list and `x` and `y` being unchanged, the output will be the string representation of the `visits` list with each element separated by a space. However, the actual values of `visits` are not provided, so we cannot specify the exact content of the output string.

Output State: **`houses` is a non-empty list, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, the output is the string representation of the `visits` list with each element separated by a space**
