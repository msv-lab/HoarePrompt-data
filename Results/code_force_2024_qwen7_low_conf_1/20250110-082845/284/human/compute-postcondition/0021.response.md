Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is `i+1`, `x` is `i+1`, `houses` is a list containing `n` tuples, each of the form `(i+1, i+1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, `x` is set to `i + 1` and `y` is set to `i % n + 1`.
- Since `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, `x` and `y` both end up being `i + 1`.
- Therefore, the tuple added to `houses` in each iteration is `(i + 1, i + 1)`.
- After all iterations, `houses` will contain `n` such tuples, specifically `(1, 1), (2, 2), ..., (n, n)`.
