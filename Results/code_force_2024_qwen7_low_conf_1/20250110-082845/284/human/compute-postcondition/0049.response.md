Postcondition: **`j` is from 0 to n-1, `i` is n, `visits[i]` remains unchanged if no house is found, or it contains the correct index if a house is found, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, and the current value of `dist` is equal to `a[i]`**
