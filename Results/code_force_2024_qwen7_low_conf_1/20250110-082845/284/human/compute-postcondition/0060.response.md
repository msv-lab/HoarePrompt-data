Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `visits[i]` remains unchanged.
   - If `i` is not equal to `j`, then `visits[i]` is set to 1.
   - `dist` is set to `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[0][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[0][1])`.
   - If `dist` equals `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `i` is equal to `j`, the values remain unchanged.

2. **Current Iteration**: The loop is iterating over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Next Iteration**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration (`j = 1`).

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - Since `i` is `n` (unchanged), we only need to consider the changes happening within the loop for `j`.
   - At the start of the first iteration, `j` is 0, and `i` is `n`. Let's assume no conditions were met to break out of the loop during this iteration.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - `i` remains `n` (unchanged).
   - `visits[i]` remains unchanged.
   - `dist` is recalculated as `abs(houses[n][0] - houses[0][0]) + abs(houses[n][1] - houses[0][1])` because `i` is `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (when `j` is 1) will be:
- `j` is 1.
- `i` is `n`.
- `visits[i]` remains unchanged.
- `dist` is recalculated based on the new `j` value.

**State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n`, `visits[i]` remains unchanged, `dist` is `abs(houses[n][0] - houses[0][0]) + abs(houses[n][1] - houses[0][1])`**
