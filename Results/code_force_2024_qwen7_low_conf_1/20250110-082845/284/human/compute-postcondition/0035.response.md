The code `break` does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code, the only impact is that the program will exit the nearest such construct. However, since no such construct is present in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-1 \), `j` is 1, `dist` is \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \), `visits[i]` is 2**
