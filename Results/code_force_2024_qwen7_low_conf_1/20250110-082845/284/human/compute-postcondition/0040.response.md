`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. Given that `i` is `n-1` and `j` is 2, the value of `visits[i]` becomes `2 + 1`, which is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is \( n-1 \), `j` is 2, `dist` is \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \); `visits[i]` is 3.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-1 \), `j` is 2, `dist` is \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \); `visits[i]` is 3**
