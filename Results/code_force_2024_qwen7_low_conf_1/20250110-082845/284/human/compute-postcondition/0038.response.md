According to the given code snippet, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `i` remains \( n-1 \)
- `j` is 1
- If `i` does not equal `j`, then `dist` is calculated as \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \).
- If `dist` equals `a[i]`, `visits[i]` is set to 2.
- There is no other change in the state of the program.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from its current value of 1 to 2 (since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged because there is no indication that they change outside of the conditions specified in the problem statement.

State: **`i` remains \( n-1 \), `j` is 2. If `i` does not equal `j`, then `dist` is \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \). If `dist` equals `a[i]`, `visits[i]` is 2.**
