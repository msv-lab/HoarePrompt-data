According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop can execute again as long as `n` remains within its specified range.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` remains in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and that `i` is now 1 (since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 1, `houses` is a list containing the tuple `(x, 1)`**
