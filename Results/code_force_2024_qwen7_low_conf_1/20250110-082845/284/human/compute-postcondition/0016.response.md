The code `houses.append((x, y))` appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `houses`. Given the initial values of the variables: `i` is 1, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 2, `x` is 2, and `houses` is a list containing the tuple `(2, 1)`, the tuple `(2, 2)` will be appended to the list `houses`.

After executing the code, the list `houses` will contain two tuples: `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `y`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 2, `x` is 2, `houses` is a list containing the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`**
