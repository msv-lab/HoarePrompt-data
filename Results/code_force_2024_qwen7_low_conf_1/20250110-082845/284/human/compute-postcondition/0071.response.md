Postcondition: ***`j` must be within the range from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 0, `visits[0]` must either contain the correct index of a house or remain unchanged based on the condition that the Manhattan distance between `houses[0]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[0]`, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, and the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`***
