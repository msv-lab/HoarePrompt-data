Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `y` is 2
   - `x` is 2
   - `houses` is a list containing the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop can execute again if `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 to become 2.
   - The condition on `n` remains the same, but we know it is still valid since the loop can still execute.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `y` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
   - `houses` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is still in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `y` is 2
- `x` is 2
- `houses` is a list containing the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 2, `x` is 2, `houses` is a list containing the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`**
