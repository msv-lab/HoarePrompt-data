`x` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, `x` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `y`, `x`, and `houses`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 2, `x` is 3, `houses` is a list containing the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 2, `x` is 3, `houses` is a list containing the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`**
