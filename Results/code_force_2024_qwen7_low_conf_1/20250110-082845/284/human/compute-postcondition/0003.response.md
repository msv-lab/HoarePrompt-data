The code `a = list(map(int, data[1:]))` converts the elements in the slice of the list `data` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end into integers and assigns them to the list `a`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

- `data` is a list of strings.
- `data[1:]` slices the list starting from the second element.
- `map(int, data[1:])` applies the `int` function to each element in the sliced list.
- `list(map(int, data[1:]))` converts the map object into a list.

Since the initial values of `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are even integers within the range `[0, n]`, the elements in `data[1:]` will also be converted to even integers between 0 and `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are even integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string from `sys.stdin.read`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data[1:]` to integers.**
