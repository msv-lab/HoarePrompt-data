`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. According to the precondition, `i` is 0, so `visits[0]` is updated to `j + 1`. The Manhattan distance condition between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]` remains valid, and the other conditions also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` must be within the range from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 0, `visits[0]` is `j + 1`, `i` is not equal to `j`, the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`**
