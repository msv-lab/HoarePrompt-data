The code `visits[i] = j + 1` updates the value of `visits[i]` to `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is \( n-1 \) and `j` is 1. Therefore, `visits[i]` becomes \( 1 + 1 = 2 \). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-1 \), `j` is 1, `dist` is \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \), `visits[i]` is 2**
