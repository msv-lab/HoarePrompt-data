The code initializes a list `visits` with `-1` for each index ranging from `0` to `n-1`. This means that every element in the `visits` list is set to `-1`. 

- `i` remains `n-1`
- `n` remains in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `y` remains `i+1`, which is `(n-1)+1 = n`
- `x` remains `i+1`, which is `(n-1)+1 = n`
- `houses` remains a list containing `n` tuples, each of the form `(i+1, i+1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`

Therefore, after the code execution, the only new variable is `visits`, which is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `houses` is a list containing `n` tuples, each of the form `(i+1, i+1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`, `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.**
