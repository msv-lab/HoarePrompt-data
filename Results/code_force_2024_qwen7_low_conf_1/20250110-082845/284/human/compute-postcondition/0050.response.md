The code `visits[i] = j + 1` updates the value of `visits[i]` to `j + 1`. Based on the initial state, `j` is from 0 to n-1, and `i` is n. The value of `visits[i]` is updated to `j + 1`, but the specific value of `j` is not known. However, since `j` is within the range 0 to n-1, `j + 1` will be in the range 1 to n.

The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is from 0 to n-1, `i` is n, `visits[i]` is `j + 1`, `i` is not equal to `j`, and `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, which is equal to `a[i]`**
