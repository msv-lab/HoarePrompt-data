According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is any integer from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, and `visits[i]` contains the correct index of a house if the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`. Since `i` is `n` now, the condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied, and the loop will not execute again.

However, we need to adjust the states to reflect the end of the current iteration and prepare for the next one. Specifically, we need to reset `i` to 0 to start the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`j` is any integer from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 0, and `visits[i]` contains the correct index of a house if the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`. If no such house is found, `visits[i]` remains unchanged.**
