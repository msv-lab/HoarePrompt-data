The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `j` is an integer from 0 to `n-1`, `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the index of the house in `houses` whose Manhattan distance to the corresponding house in `houses` equals `a[i]` (if such a house exists) or `-1` (if no such house exists). The value `-1` exists in the `visits` list, and the console prints 'NO'**.
