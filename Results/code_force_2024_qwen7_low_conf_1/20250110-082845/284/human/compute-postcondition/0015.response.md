The code `y = i % n + 1` impacts the program by updating the value of `y`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 1, and `x` is 2, `houses` is a list containing the tuple `(x, 1)`, the calculation for `y` is `1 % n + 1`. Since `i` is 1, `1 % n` will always be 1 (because the remainder when 1 is divided by any number n in the given range is always 1). Therefore, `y` will be `1 % n + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 2, `x` is 2, `houses` is a list containing the tuple `(x, 1)`**
