The code calculates the Manhattan distance between the points `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. Since `i` is not equal to `j`, and `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`, `i` will also be within this range. However, the values of `i` and `j` themselves do not change. The variable `dist` is assigned the Manhattan distance, which is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points.

Output State: **`j` is from 0 to n-1, `i` is n, `visits[i]` remains unchanged if no house is found, or it contains the correct index if a house is found, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`**
