The code `break` does not assign any new values to variables but breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is mentioned in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program would break out of any such structure it might be in. However, since no such structure is present in the given code, the variables `i`, `n`, `j`, `dist`, and `visits` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `j` is 0, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[n-1]` and `houses[0]`, and `visits[i]` is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
