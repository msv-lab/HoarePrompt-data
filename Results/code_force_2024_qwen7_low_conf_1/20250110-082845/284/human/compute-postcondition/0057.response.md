The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the loop or the most internal if statement to terminate. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged after the execution of the `break` statement.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is \( n \), `visits[i]` is 1, `dist` is \( abs(houses[i][0] - houses[0][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[0][1]) \) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
