The code `y = i % n + 1` updates the value of `y`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), we can calculate `y` as follows:

- `i % n` evaluates to `0 % n`, which is `0`.
- Adding `1` to `0` gives `1`.

Therefore, `y` is set to `1`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `y` is 1**
