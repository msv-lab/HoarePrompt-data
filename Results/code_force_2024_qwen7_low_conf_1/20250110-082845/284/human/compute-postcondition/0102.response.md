Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `j` is an integer from 0 to `n-1`, `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the index of the house in `houses` whose Manhattan distance to the corresponding house in `houses` equals `a[i]` (if such a house exists) or `-1` (if no such house exists). If the value `-1` exists in the `visits` list, the console prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is the string representation of the `visits` list with each element separated by a space.**
