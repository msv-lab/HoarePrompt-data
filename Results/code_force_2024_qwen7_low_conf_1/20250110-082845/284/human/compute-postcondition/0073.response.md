The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match statement. Since there is no loop or match statement in the given code, it simply ends the current context without changing any variable values. The conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` must be within the range from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 0, `visits[0]` is `j + 1`, `i` is not equal to `j`, the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`.**
