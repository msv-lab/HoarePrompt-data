Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `visits[i]` is the index of the house in `houses` whose Manhattan distance to `houses[n-1]` equals `a[i]` (if such a house exists)
   - `j` is the last index that was checked in the loop. If no such house exists, `visits[i]` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will become `n` in the next iteration.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `visits` and `houses` arrays remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since we are only asked to adjust the state, we assume they stay the same.
   - `j` is updated in the loop body, so it needs to be adjusted according to the loop logic.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` becomes `n`.
   - `visits[i]` remains unchanged if no house is found, or it will contain the correct index if a house is found.
   - `j` will be updated to the last index that was checked in the loop during the current iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visits[i]` is the index of the house in `houses` whose Manhattan distance to `houses[n-1]` equals `a[i]` (if such a house exists), and `j` is the last index that was checked in the loop.**
