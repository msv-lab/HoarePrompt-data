The code initializes an empty list called `houses`. This does not change the values of `n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `data`, or `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `houses` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are even integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string from `sys.stdin.read`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data[1:]` to integers; all elements `ai` in `a` satisfy the condition ai ≤ 2 * (n - 1); `houses` is an empty list**
