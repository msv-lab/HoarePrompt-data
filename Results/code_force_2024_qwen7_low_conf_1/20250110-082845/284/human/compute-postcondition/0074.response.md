Postcondition: ***`j` must be within the range from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 0, `visits[0]` is `j + 1`, `i` is not equal to `j`, the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`, if the distance condition is met. Otherwise, the original state where `visits[0]` either contains the correct index of a house or remains unchanged based on the condition that the Manhattan distance between `houses[0]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[0]` is preserved.***
