According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `houses`. The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the `houses` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `houses` is a non-empty list.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop will continue as long as there are tuples left in the `houses` list.
2. Since `houses` is a non-empty list at the end of the previous iteration, it means that there is at least one tuple left in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `houses` list must still contain at least one tuple. Therefore, we can conclude that at the start of the next iteration, `houses` will be a non-empty list, but we do not know the exact number of elements left in the list. However, since it was non-empty at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain non-empty.

State: **`houses` is a non-empty list**
