First, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State: `i` remains \( n-1 \), `j` is 2. If `i` does not equal `j`, then `dist` is \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \). If `dist` equals `a[i]`, `visits[i]` is 2.

Code Snippet:
```python
dist = abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])
```

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The value of `i` is \( n-1 \) and the value of `j` is 2.
2. Since `i` is \( n-1 \) and `j` is 2, and \( i \neq j \) (because \( n-1 \neq 2 \)), the condition `i` does not equal `j` is satisfied.
3. According to the initial state, `dist` should be \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \).
4. The code assigns this value to `dist`.

So, the updated values are:
- `i` remains \( n-1 \)
- `j` remains 2
- `dist` is assigned the value \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \)

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-1 \), `j` is 2, `dist` is \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \)**
