Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visits[i]` is the index of the house in `houses` whose Manhattan distance to `houses[n-1]` equals `a[i]` (if such a house exists), and `j` is the last index that was checked in the loop. If no such house exists, `visits[i]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each `j`, it checks if `i` is not equal to `j`.
- If `i` is not equal to `j`, it calculates the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`.
- If this distance equals `a[i]`, it sets `visits[i]` to `j + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
- After the loop completes, `visits[i]` will hold the index of the house in `houses` whose Manhattan distance to `houses[n-1]` equals `a[i]` (if such a house exists). Otherwise, it will remain unchanged.
- The value of `j` will be the last index that was checked in the loop.

Since the loop will eventually check all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, the final state of `visits[i]` will be determined by whether any house meets the condition or not.
