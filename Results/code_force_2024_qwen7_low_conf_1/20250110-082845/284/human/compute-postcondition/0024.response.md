According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Given the initial state where `i` is `n-1` and `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means `n` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied given the range.

However, we also need to set the initial value of the loop variable `j` to 0, since the loop will start with `j = 0`.

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `j` is 0**
