Postcondition: ***`i` remains \( n-1 \), `j` is 2. If `i` does not equal `j`, `dist` is \( abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[1][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[1][1]) \). If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is 3 and the most internal loop or block is broken. No changes occur in the state of the program if `i` equals `j`.***
