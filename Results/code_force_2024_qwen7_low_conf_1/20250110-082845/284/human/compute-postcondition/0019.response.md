The code updates the value of `y` to be `i % n + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), the expression `i % n + 1` simplifies to `2 % n + 1`. Since `2 % n` will always be 2 when `n` is 2 (as per the given range constraint and initial values), `y` will be `2 % 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`. 

The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `x`, and `houses`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is 2, `x` is 3, `houses` is a list containing the tuples `(2, 1)` and `(2, 2)`**
