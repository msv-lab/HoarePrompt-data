Postcondition: ***`j` must be within the range from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 0, and `visits[0]` either contains the correct index of a house or remains unchanged based on the condition that the Manhattan distance between `houses[0]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[0]`. If `i` is not equal to `j`, `visits[0]` is set to `j + 1` and the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` must equal `a[i]`. Otherwise, the original state where `visits[0]` either contains the correct index of a house or remains unchanged is preserved.***
