Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, and `visits[i]` either contains the correct index of a house or remains unchanged based on the condition that the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`. For each `i`, if there exists a `j` such that the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1`. Otherwise, `visits[i]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
1. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. Inside the loop, the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` is calculated.
3. If this distance equals `a[i]`, `visits[i]` is updated to `j + 1` and the loop breaks.
4. After the loop completes for a particular `i`, `visits[i]` will either be the correct index of a house (if the condition is met) or it will retain its original value (unchanged).
5. Since the loop runs for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the final state of `visits` will be determined by whether the condition was met for each `i`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will have the value `n-1`, `j` will have cycled through all possible values from `0` to `n-1`, and `visits[i]` will either contain the correct index of a house or remain unchanged based on the condition specified.
