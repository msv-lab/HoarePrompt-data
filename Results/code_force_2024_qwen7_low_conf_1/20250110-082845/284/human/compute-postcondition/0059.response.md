Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `i` is `n`, and `visits[i]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to `j`, then `visits[i]` is set to 1, `dist` is set to `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[0][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[0][1])`. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is equal to `j`, the values remain unchanged.***
