To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` becomes `n`.
   - `visits[i]` remains unchanged if no house is found, or it will contain the correct index if a house is found.
   - `j` will be updated to the last index that was checked in the loop during the current iteration.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, `j` must range from `0` to `n-1` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `i` initially becomes `n`, but since the loop is iterating over `j`, we need to ensure `i` is set appropriately for the next iteration.
   - `visits[i]` needs to be considered for the next iteration, as its value might affect the loop's behavior (e.g., if a house is found, its index is stored).

Based on these points, the necessary states to adjust are:
- `j` must range from `0` to `n-1` for the loop to execute.
- `i` should be reset to `n` for the next iteration.
- `visits[i]` must be consistent with the state after the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State:**
- `j` is from `0` to `n-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `visits[i]` remains unchanged if no house is found, or it contains the correct index if a house is found.

Putting it all together:

**State: **`j` is from 0 to n-1, `i` is n, `visits[i]` remains unchanged if no house is found, or it contains the correct index if a house is found.**
