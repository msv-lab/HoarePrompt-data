Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading and Validation**:
   - The program reads the input values correctly using `sys.stdin.read` and splits them into `n` and the list `a`.
   - It checks if any `a_i` exceeds `2 * (n - 1)`. If it does, the program immediately outputs `NO`, which aligns with the requirement that wizards cannot be more than `2 * (n - 1)` away from their houses.

2. **Placing Houses**:
   - The program places the houses in a simple pattern where each house is placed at coordinates `(i + 1, i % n + 1)`. This ensures that no two houses share the same column (`x` coordinate).

3. **Determining Visits**:
   - For each wizard, the program calculates the Manhattan distance to all other houses and checks if the distance matches `a_i`.
   - If a matching house is found, it records the index of the visiting house plus one in the `visits` list. If no match is found, the `visits` list will contain `-1`.

4. **Output**:
   - If any wizard fails to find a valid visiting house (`-1` in the `visits` list), the program outputs `NO`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `YES` followed by the coordinates of each house and the indices of the houses that each wizard will visit.

Given these steps, the program adheres to all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
