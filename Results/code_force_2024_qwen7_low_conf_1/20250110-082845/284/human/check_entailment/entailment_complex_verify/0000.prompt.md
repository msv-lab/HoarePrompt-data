You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The only difference between this and the hard version is that all a_{i} are
even.

After some recent attacks on Hogwarts Castle by the Death Eaters, the Order of
the Phoenix has decided to station n members in Hogsmead Village. The houses
will be situated on a picturesque n\times n square field. Each wizard will
have their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house
will take up the space of one square.

However, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the
weekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0
\leq a_{i} \leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are
built horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},
y_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -
y_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit
another wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built
will be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.

Apart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle
in the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other
wizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each
column of the n\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i
-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \neq x_{j} for all i
\neq j .

The Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses
in such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n
wizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.

If it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard
there is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard
is the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each
wizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the
weekends.

If it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.

Input

The first line contains n (2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses
to be built.

The second line contains n integers a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n} (0 \leq a_{i} \leq n)
. All a_{i} are even.

Output

If there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,
output NO.

If the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.

The next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \leq x_{i},
y_{i} \leq n for each wizard.

The i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the
house of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If
there are multiple such wizards, you can output any.

If there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.

Example

Input

    4
    0 4 2 4

Output

    YES
    4 4
    1 3
    2 4
    3 1
    1 1 1 3

Note

For the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd
at (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .

The distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .

The distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .

The distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .

The distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard
is |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .

The view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the
placement is correct.

If the value `-1` exists in the `visits` list, the console prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is the string representation of the `visits` list with each element separated by a space.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, checks if it's possible to visit all houses in a specific order based on given distances, and prints 'YES' along with the visiting order and the distances between consecutive houses if possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and returns `None`.

1. It first reads the input, which consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` even integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It ensures that these integers meet certain constraints: `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `0 ≤ a_i ≤ n`.
2. It then constructs a list of houses with coordinates `(i+1, i+1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
3. For each house, it tries to find another house whose Manhattan distance to the current house matches the corresponding `a_i` value. If such a house is found, it records the index of this house in the `visits` list. If no such house is found for any `a_i`, it prints 'NO'.
4. If all `a_i` values are matched, it prints 'YES', the list of house coordinates, and the visiting order (as indices in the `visits` list).

Potential edge cases:
- If any `a_i` value exceeds `2 * (n - 1)`, the function immediately prints 'NO' and returns, as it violates the problem constraints.
- If no valid visiting order can be determined, the function prints 'NO'.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where multiple valid visiting orders exist. It only checks for the existence of a valid visiting order and prints the first one it finds.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple wizards can visit the same house. According to the problem description, each wizard \(i\) wants to visit the house that is exactly \(a_i\) away from their own house, and the house of no other wizard should block the view, meaning that in each column, there can be at most one house.

In the given solution, the program calculates the positions of the houses and then tries to assign the visits. However, it does not ensure that the visited house is the only one in its column. For example, consider the following input:

```
4
0 2 2 2
```

In this case, if the houses are placed as follows:
- Wizard 1: (1, 1)
- Wizard 2: (1, 3)
- Wizard 3: (3, 1)
- Wizard 4: (3, 3)

The distances are:
- Distance from Wizard 1 to Wizard 1: \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- Distance from Wizard 2 to Wizard 1: \(|1-1| + |3-1| = 2\)
- Distance from Wizard 3 to Wizard 1: \(|3-1| + |1-1| = 2\)
- Distance from Wizard 4 to Wizard 1: \(|3-1| + |3-1| = 4\)

This satisfies the distance requirement, but Wizard 2 and Wizard 3 both visit the same column (column 1), which violates the condition that no two houses can be in the same column.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the visited house is the only one in its column.
