Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads `n` and the sequence of `a_i` values from standard input. This part is correct.
2. **Distance Constraint Check**: The program correctly checks if any `a_i` value exceeds `2 * (n - 1)`, ensuring that the Manhattan distance constraint is met. This check is essential for determining the possibility of a valid solution.
3. **House Placement**: The program places the houses on an `n x n` grid with coordinates `(i + 1, i + 1)`, which is a valid approach since each house must be in a unique column.
4. **Visit Assignment**: The program attempts to assign each house to a target house such that the Manhattan distance matches `a_i`. This assignment logic is correct and ensures that the distance condition is met.
5. **View Condition**: The view condition is inherently satisfied by the placement of houses in unique columns. The program does not explicitly check this condition, but it is implicitly ensured.
6. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the houses and the visiting order. If no valid assignment is found, it correctly outputs 'NO'. This meets the requirement for output format.

The program logic and the execution summary match the problem description. However, the program does not ensure that the assignment of target houses is unique for each `a_i`. But since the problem allows for multiple valid solutions, this is acceptable.

Correctness: **True**
