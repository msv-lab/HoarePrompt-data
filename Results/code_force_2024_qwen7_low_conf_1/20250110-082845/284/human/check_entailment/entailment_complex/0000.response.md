Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The program correctly checks if any `a_i` value exceeds `2 * (n - 1)`, which would violate the problem constraints. If such a value is found, the program correctly outputs 'NO' and returns.

2. **House Placement**: The program places the houses in a grid with coordinates `(i+1, i+1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. This ensures that each house occupies a unique column, satisfying the requirement that no two houses share the same column.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the Manhattan distance between each pair of houses to check if it matches the corresponding `a_i` value. If a match is found, it records the index of the visited house in the `visits` list. This process ensures that each wizard can visit a house that is exactly `a_i` units away.

4. **Output**: If all `a_i` values are matched, the program correctly outputs 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the houses and the visiting order. If no valid visiting order is found, it correctly outputs 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the basic edge case where an `a_i` value is invalid by immediately returning 'NO'. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where multiple valid visiting orders exist, but it does not claim to do so, and the problem statement does not require handling all valid configurations.

Given that the program correctly follows the logic and constraints specified in the problem statement, and it outputs the correct responses for both valid and invalid configurations, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
