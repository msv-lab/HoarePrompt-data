### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the logic of the `func_1` function in detail:

1. **Case when `m == k` or `k > n`:**
   - As stated, if `m == k` or `k > n`, Bob can always repaint parts to make all parts the same color. Therefore, returning 'NO' is correct.
   
2. **Case when `m > k`:**
   - If `m > k`, it means there are more colors than the number of parts Bob can repaint. Bob cannot repaint enough parts to match the existing color distribution. Thus, returning 'YES' is correct.

3. **Case when `m < k` but `k <= n`:**
   - This case is indeed not explicitly covered in the function. According to the problem, if `m < k`, Bob still has the ability to repaint up to `k` parts, which could potentially make all parts the same color. Therefore, the function should return 'NO' in this case.

Given the problem statement and the examples provided, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the `m < k` but `k <= n` case. Let's consider the following test cases to illustrate the issue:

- For `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`: Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`. Bob can choose to repaint up to 3 parts, but he cannot make all parts the same color (since he can only change up to 2 parts to the other color).
- For `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 4`: Bob can repaint up to 4 parts, but since there are only 2 colors and 2 of the parts are already painted differently, Bob can still make all parts the same color by repainting 2 parts.

The function incorrectly returns 'NO' in the first case (`m < k`) and 'YES' in the second case (`m < k` but `k > n`), which contradicts the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function does not handle the `m < k` but `k <= n` case correctly. Given the problem constraints and the need to cover all edge cases, the function needs to return 'NO' in the `m < k` but `k <= n` case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
