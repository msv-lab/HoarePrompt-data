Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where `m > k` and `k <= n`. According to the problem description, if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, the answer should be 'YES'. However, the current implementation returns 'NO' in this scenario. 

For example, consider the test case `(n=5, m=3, k=2)`. In this case, Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that makes it impossible for Bob to make all parts the same color, such as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`. The program, however, incorrectly returns 'NO' because it checks `if m == k or k > n` and returns 'NO', even though `m > k`.

To fix this, the condition checking `m > k` should return 'YES'. Here is the corrected version:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if m == k or k >= n:
        return 'NO'
    else:
        return 'YES'
```

This ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem.
