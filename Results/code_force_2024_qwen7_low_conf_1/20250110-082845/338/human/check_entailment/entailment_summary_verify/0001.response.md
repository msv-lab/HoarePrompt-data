### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the logic of the `func_1` function based on the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Case when `m == k` or `k > n`:**
   - If `m == k`, Bob can potentially repaint all parts to match the existing colors, making it impossible for Alice to prevent him from making all parts the same color. Thus, the output 'NO' is correct.
   - If `k > n`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, again making it impossible for Alice to prevent him from making all parts the same color. The output 'NO' is correct.

2. **Case when `m > k`:**
   - If `m > k`, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to match the existing color distribution. Since there are more colors than the number of parts Bob can repaint, Bob cannot make all parts the same color. Therefore, the output 'YES' is correct.

3. **Case when `m < k` but `k <= n`:**
   - According to the problem statement, if `m < k` but `k <= n`, Alice can still paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. This is because even though `m < k`, the number of parts `n` limits the number of unique colors Alice can use. The current implementation correctly returns 'NO' in this case.

However, the original assessment overlooked the fact that the function does not handle the case where `m < k` and `k > n` explicitly. Given the problem constraints and the examples, the function should be able to handle this case without issues, as it correctly returns 'NO' when `m < k` and `k <= n`.

### Final Evaluation:
The function `func_1` correctly handles all the primary cases specified in the problem statement and examples. Although the original assessment noted that the function did not explicitly handle the case where `m < k` and `k <= n`, this case is covered by the existing logic.

Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description and examples provided.

**Final: True**
