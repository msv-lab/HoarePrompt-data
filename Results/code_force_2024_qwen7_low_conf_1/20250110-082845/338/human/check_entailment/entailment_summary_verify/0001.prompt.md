You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if m == k or k > n:
        return 'NO'
    elif m > k:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
- The function does not handle cases where `n`, `m`, or `k` are outside their specified ranges (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50). If such inputs are given, the function will still execute based on the provided conditions but will not enforce these constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic of the `func_1` function and compare it with the problem statement and examples.

1. **Case when `m == k` or `k > n`:**
   - If `m == k`, it means Bob can repaint exactly as many parts as there are different colors. This allows Bob to repaint parts to match the existing color of any part he chooses.
   - If `k > n`, Bob can repaint more parts than there are parts in total. This also means Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color.
   - In both cases, the output is correctly set to 'NO' because Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

2. **Case when `m > k`:**
   - If `m > k`, it means Bob cannot repaint enough parts to match the color distribution created by Alice. Since there are more colors than the number of parts Bob can repaint, Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
   - The output is correctly set to 'YES' because Alice can create a color distribution that Bob cannot match.

3. **Case when `m < k` but `m <= n`:**
   - This case is not explicitly covered in the function. According to the problem, this case should follow the same logic as `m > k`. However, the current implementation does not handle this case, which could lead to incorrect results if `m < k` and `k <= n`.

Given the problem constraints and examples, the function `func_1` correctly handles the primary conditions specified. However, the function does not handle the case where `m < k` but `k <= n`. This is a minor oversight since the problem specifies `1 <= m, k <= n <= 50`, and the given examples do not cover this scenario. 

Since the primary logic is correct and covers the major cases, we can conclude that the function is mostly correct, but it may fail for specific edge cases not covered in the given examples.

Correctness: **False**
