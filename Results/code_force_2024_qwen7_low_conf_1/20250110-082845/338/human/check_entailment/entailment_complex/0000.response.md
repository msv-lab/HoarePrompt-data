Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1(n, m, k)`**:
   - **Case 1**: If \( m == k \) or \( k > n \), the function returns 'NO'. This is correct because:
     - If \( m == k \), it means that Bob can repaint exactly as many parts as there are different colors, allowing him to achieve his goal of making all parts the same color.
     - If \( k > n \), it implies that Bob can repaint more than the total number of parts, which is not possible since there are only \( n \) parts. Thus, he can always achieve his goal.
   - **Case 2**: If \( m > k \), the function returns 'YES'. This is correct because:
     - If there are more colors (\( m > k \)) than the number of parts Bob can repaint (\( k \)), it is impossible for Bob to make all parts the same color.
   - **Case 3**: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'NO', which is also correct because it covers all other scenarios where Bob can potentially make all parts the same color.

2. **Handling Input Constraints**:
   - The function does not explicitly check if \( 1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50 \). However, based on the logic used, it implicitly handles these constraints:
     - If \( n \) were less than \( m \) or \( k \), the conditions \( m == k \) or \( k > n \) would trigger the 'NO' response, aligning with the problem constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as \( n = 1 \) (where Bob can always achieve his goal regardless of \( m \) and \( k \)).
   - It also handles cases where \( m \) and \( k \) are within their valid ranges but still correctly determines the output.

Given the above reasoning, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all valid inputs according to the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
