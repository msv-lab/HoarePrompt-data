Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic of the `func_1` function and compare it with the problem statement and examples.

1. **Case when `m == k` or `k > n`:**
   - If `m == k`, it means Bob can repaint exactly as many parts as there are different colors. This allows Bob to repaint parts to match the existing color of any part he chooses.
   - If `k > n`, Bob can repaint more parts than there are parts in total. This also means Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color.
   - In both cases, the output is correctly set to 'NO' because Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

2. **Case when `m > k`:**
   - If `m > k`, it means Bob cannot repaint enough parts to match the color distribution created by Alice. Since there are more colors than the number of parts Bob can repaint, Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
   - The output is correctly set to 'YES' because Alice can create a color distribution that Bob cannot match.

3. **Case when `m < k` but `m <= n`:**
   - This case is not explicitly covered in the function. According to the problem, this case should follow the same logic as `m > k`. However, the current implementation does not handle this case, which could lead to incorrect results if `m < k` and `k <= n`.

Given the problem constraints and examples, the function `func_1` correctly handles the primary conditions specified. However, the function does not handle the case where `m < k` but `k <= n`. This is a minor oversight since the problem specifies `1 <= m, k <= n <= 50`, and the given examples do not cover this scenario. 

Since the primary logic is correct and covers the major cases, we can conclude that the function is mostly correct, but it may fail for specific edge cases not covered in the given examples.

Correctness: **False**
