Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) from the input. It calculates the maximum possible color count \((n + m - 1) / m\) and checks if adding \(k\) to this value is sufficient to reach or exceed \(n\). If the condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function accepts no parameters and returns no value. After processing all test cases, the program ends. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values for \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\)), but the provided code does not handle these cases. Additionally, the code assumes \(t\) is within the specified range (1 ≤ \(t\) ≤ 1000) and that for each test case, \(1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50\), which might not always hold true. If these conditions are not met, the function's behavior is undefined.**
