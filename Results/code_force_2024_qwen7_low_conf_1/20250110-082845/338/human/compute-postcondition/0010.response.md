The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means that the values of `t`, `max_color`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.

- `t` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is now an integer input from the user.
- `m` is now an integer input from the user.
- `k` is now an integer input from the user.
- `max_color` is calculated as `(n + m - 1) / m` based on the new values of `n` and `m`.
- `i` is set to the value of `t`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`.
- `i` is `t`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`; `i` is `t`**
