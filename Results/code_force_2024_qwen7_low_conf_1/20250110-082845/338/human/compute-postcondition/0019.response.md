The code prints 'YES', but this does not affect the values of the variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\), `i` is `t + 1`**
