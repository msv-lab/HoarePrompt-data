The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables. The only change is the print statement itself.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\), `i` is `t + 1`, print statement outputs 'NO'**
