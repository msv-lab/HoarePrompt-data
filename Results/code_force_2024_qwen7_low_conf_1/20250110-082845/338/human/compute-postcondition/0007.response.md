The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. These are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. 

- Case_1: If the conditions are not met leading to a 'NO' return, the function returns 'NO'.
- Case_2: If certain conditions are met leading to a 'YES' return, the function returns 'YES'.
- Case_3: If other conditions do not meet the criteria leading to a 'NO' return, the function returns 'NO'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (with the constraints 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50), and based on specific conditions, return either 'YES' or 'NO'.
