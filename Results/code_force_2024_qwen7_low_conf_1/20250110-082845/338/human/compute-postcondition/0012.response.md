The code simply prints 'NO', which does not affect any of the variables. The output of the print statement is shown but does not change the values of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`; `i` is `t`; printed value is 'NO'**
