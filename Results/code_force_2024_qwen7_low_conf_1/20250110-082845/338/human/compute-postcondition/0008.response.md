Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (with the constraints 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50). It checks specific conditions and returns either 'YES' or 'NO'. Specifically:
- If `m == k` or `k > n`, the function returns 'NO'.
- If `m > k`, the function returns 'YES'.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the function also returns 'NO'.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program will have returned either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the input values. There are no other changes to the program state besides the return value.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where `n`, `m`, or `k` are outside their specified ranges (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50). If such inputs are given, the function will still execute based on the provided conditions but will not enforce these constraints.**

This summary focuses on the actual functionality of the code and includes potential edge cases where input values might violate the stated constraints.
