Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes all its iterations.

### Initial State
- \( t \) is an integer input.
- \( n, m, k \) are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50 \).

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    max_color = (n + m - 1) / m
    if max_color + k >= n:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
```

### Analysis of the Loop

1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for \( t \) times.
   - In each iteration, it takes three integers \( n, m, k \) as input and computes `max_color`.
   - The condition `max_color + k >= n` is checked.
   - Depending on the result of this condition, either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed.

2. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - Since the loop runs exactly \( t \) times, after all iterations, the state of the variables \( n, m, k \) will depend on the inputs in each iteration.
   - The variable `max_color` is computed in each iteration and used to decide the output ('NO' or 'YES').
   - The variable `i` will be equal to \( t \) after the last iteration, but it does not affect the final state of the variables \( n, m, k \).
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the loop, the following conditions will hold:
- \( t \) is an integer input.
- \( n, m, k \) are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50 \) (these constraints apply to each input \( n, m, k \) within the loop, but the final state will reflect the inputs processed).
- For each iteration, if `max_color + k >= n`, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is 'YES'.

Since the loop processes \( t \) inputs and each input sets the value of \( n, m, k \), the final state will be determined by the last set of inputs.

### Output State
**Output State:**
**`t` is an integer input, `n, m, k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50 \). For each iteration, if \((n + m - 1) / m + k \geq n\), the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is 'YES'.**

This captures the final state of the variables and the decision made by the loop based on the last set of inputs.
