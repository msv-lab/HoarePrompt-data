The code simply prints 'YES' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`; `i` is `t`; print statement outputs 'YES'**
