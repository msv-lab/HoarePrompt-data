The code snippet reads three integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This means the values of `t`, `max_color`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

The previous values of `t`, `max_color`, and `i` are:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1
- `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\)
- `i` is `t + 1`

After the code is executed, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the new input values, while `t`, `max_color`, and `i` retain their previous values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\), `i` is `t + 1`**
