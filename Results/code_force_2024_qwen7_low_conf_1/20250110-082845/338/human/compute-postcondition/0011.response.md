The code `max_color = (n + m - 1) / m` does not change the value of `max_color` because it is already set to `(n + m - 1) / m`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `max_color` is `(n + m - 1) / m`; `i` is `t`**
