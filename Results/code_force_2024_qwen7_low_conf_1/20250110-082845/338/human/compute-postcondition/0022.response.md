The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function is part of a larger context where `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are used. Given the constraints, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50.

Since the function definition itself does not take any parameters, the return value is not specified in the given context. The output mentioned is related to the behavior of the function when called with appropriate parameters in a loop or test case context.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to be determined based on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` passed to it. Given the constraints, it likely processes multiple test cases where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes `n`, `m`, and `k`.**
