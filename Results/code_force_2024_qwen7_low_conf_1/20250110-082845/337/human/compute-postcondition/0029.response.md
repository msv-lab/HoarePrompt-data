`total_value` is updated by adding `max_balls` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `total_value` was unchanged, and now it is updated to `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`. The other variables (`mask`, `max_balls`, and `n`) remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`mask` is `mask + n - 1`, `max_balls` is the maximum value among `a[i]` where `mask & 1 << i` is true, `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`, and `n` is greater than 0.**
