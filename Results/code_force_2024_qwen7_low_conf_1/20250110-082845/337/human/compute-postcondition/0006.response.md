The code snippet `max_balls = max(max_balls, a[i])` impacts the program by updating the value of `max_balls` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`. However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `a` is an array where `i` is a valid index.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `i` is 0
- The expression `(mask & 1 << i)` evaluates to a non-zero value

From the condition `(mask & 1 << i)` evaluating to a non-zero value, we know that `mask & (1 << 0)` is non-zero, which means `mask` has the least significant bit set to 1. This is a valid condition, but does not affect the values of `n` and `i`.

Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`. The value of `max_balls` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is 0, `max_balls` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[0]`.**
