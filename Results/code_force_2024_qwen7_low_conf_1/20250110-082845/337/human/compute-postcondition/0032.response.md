According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs `n` times, and since `n` is specified as being greater than 0, the loop can execute if this condition holds true.

The current states provided are:
- `mask` is `mask + n`
- `max_balls` is 0
- `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`
- `n` is greater than 0

The loop itself doesn't affect the values of `mask`, `max_balls`, or `total_value` directly (since the loop body is omitted). However, the loop can only execute if `n` is greater than 0, which is already given as a condition.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for these states as they are already correctly specified to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`mask` is `mask + n`, `max_balls` is 0, `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`, and `n` is greater than 0**
