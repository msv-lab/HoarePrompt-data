The code updates the `max_balls` variable by taking the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`. Given that the `i`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, it means that `i` is a valid index for the array `a`. However, the initial value of `max_balls` is 0, so `max_balls` will be updated to `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 0.

Since the initial state includes that `n` must be greater than 0 and the current value of `mask` has the `i`-th bit set to 1, these conditions remain true post-execution. The `total_value` remains unchanged, and `mask` is updated by adding 1, which changes only the least significant bit of `mask`.

Output State: **`mask` is `mask + 1`, `max_balls` is `a[i]` if `a[i] > 0`, else `0`, `total_value` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0**
