According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to \(n-1\). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). The loop body checks if `mask & 1 << i != 0`. If this condition is true, then `max_balls` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[0]`.

Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, for the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1. Therefore, we need to check the condition `mask & 1 << 1` in the next iteration.

Given the condition `mask & 1 << i != 0`, for `i = 1`, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is 1, `max_balls` remains unchanged if the condition `mask & 1 << 1` is not met**.
