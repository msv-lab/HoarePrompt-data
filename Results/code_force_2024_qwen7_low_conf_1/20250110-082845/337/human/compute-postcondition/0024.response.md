Postcondition: ***`mask`, `max_balls`, `total_value`, and `n` are as follows: If the `(i+1)`-th bit of `mask` is set (`mask & 1 << (i+1) != 0`), then `max_balls` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`; otherwise, `max_balls` remains unchanged. `total_value` and `n` remain unchanged, with `n` still being greater than 0.***
