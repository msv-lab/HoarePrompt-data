Postcondition: **`mask` is `mask + n`, `max_balls` is the maximum of the original `max_balls` and `a[i]`, and `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`. This is true if and only if the bit at position `i` in `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << i != 0`). Otherwise, the original values of `mask`, `max_balls`, and `total_value` remain unchanged.**
