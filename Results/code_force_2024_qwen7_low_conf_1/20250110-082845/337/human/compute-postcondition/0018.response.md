According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. 

- The state `mask` is given as `mask + 1`, which implies that `mask` is being incremented by 1 at some point before or during the loop. However, this does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute.
- The state `max_balls` is 0, which does not necessarily prevent the loop from executing unless there is additional logic that depends on `max_balls`.
- The state `total_value` remains unchanged, meaning its value is not modified outside of the loop itself and does not affect the loop's execution.

Given these points, the critical factor for the loop to execute is the value of `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`mask` is `mask + 1`, `max_balls` is 0, `total_value` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0**
