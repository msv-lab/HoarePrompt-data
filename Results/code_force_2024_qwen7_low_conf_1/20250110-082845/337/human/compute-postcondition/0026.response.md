The code updates `max_balls` to be the maximum value between its current value and `a[i]`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `a[i]` or the current value of `max_balls`, we can denote `max_balls` as the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`.

The other variables (`mask`, `total_value`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mask` is unchanged, `max_balls` is the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`, `total_value` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`**
