The code updates the value of `max_balls` to be the maximum between its current value and `a[i]`. The previous value of `a[i]` is unknown, but the updated value of `max_balls` will be the maximum of the original `max_balls` and `a[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `mask` is `mask + n`, `max_balls` is the maximum of the original `max_balls` and `a[i]`, and `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`.

Output State: **`mask` is `mask + n`, `max_balls` is the maximum of the original `max_balls` and `a[i]`, and `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`**
