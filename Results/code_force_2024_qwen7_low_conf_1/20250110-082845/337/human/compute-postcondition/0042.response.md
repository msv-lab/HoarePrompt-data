Output State: **`mask` is `mask + n`, `max_balls` is the maximum value among the bits in `mask` that are set (i.e., where `mask & 1 << i != 0`), and `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`.** 

Explanation:
- The variable `mask` starts as `mask + n` and remains this way throughout the loop.
- The variable `max_balls` is updated during each iteration of the loop if the bit at position `i` in `mask` is set (`mask & 1 << i != 0`). It takes the maximum value between its current value and `a[i]`.
- The variable `total_value` is updated during each iteration of the loop if the bit at position `i` in `mask` is set. It is incremented by `max_balls` modulo `MOD`.

If the loop does not execute at all (which happens if none of the bits in `mask` are set to 1), then the values of `mask`, `max_balls`, and `total_value` remain as they were in the initial state:
- `mask` is still `mask + n`.
- `max_balls` is still 0.
- `total_value` is still `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`, which simplifies to just `total_value % MOD` since `max_balls` is 0.
