Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\). It calculates and returns the sum of the maximum values of all possible non-empty subsets of `a`. This is achieved through a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over all possible bit masks (subsets) of the list `a`, and the inner loop determines the maximum value for each subset represented by the current bit mask. The result is accumulated in `total_value`, which is then returned modulo \(998244353\).**

This functionality covers the following:
- The function considers all \(2^n - 1\) non-empty subsets of the input list `a`.
- For each subset, it finds the maximum element.
- It sums these maximum values across all subsets.
- The final result is returned modulo \(998244353\).

Edge cases and considerations:
- If `n` is 0, the function will return 0 because there are no non-empty subsets to consider.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within a specific range, which is typical for problems requiring results under a large prime number to prevent overflow.
