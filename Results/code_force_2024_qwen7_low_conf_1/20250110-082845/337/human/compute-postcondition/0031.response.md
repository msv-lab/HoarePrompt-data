The variable `max_balls` is assigned the value `0`. This means that the previous value of `max_balls` is no longer relevant and is replaced by `0`. The other variables (`mask`, `total_value`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`mask` is `mask + n`, `max_balls` is 0, `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`, and `n` is greater than 0**
