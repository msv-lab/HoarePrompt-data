To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and follow a step-by-step approach.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `mask`: The current value of the mask.
  - `max_balls`: Updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[i]` if the `(i+1)`-th bit of `mask` is set.
  - `total_value`: Remains unchanged.
  - `n`: Remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `mask`: Current value.
   - `max_balls`: Updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[i]` if the `(i+1)`-th bit of `mask` is set.
   - `total_value`: Unchanged.
   - `n`: Unchanged and still greater than 0.

2. **Determine the Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - Since `n` remains unchanged and is greater than 0, the loop can continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Update the State for Next Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented from `i` to `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `mask` remains unchanged.
   - `max_balls` remains unchanged.
   - `total_value` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still greater than 0.

### Final State for Next Iteration:
- `mask`: Unchanged.
- `max_balls`: Unchanged.
- `total_value`: Unchanged.
- `n`: Still greater than 0.
- `i`: Incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`mask` is unchanged, `max_balls` is unchanged, `total_value` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
