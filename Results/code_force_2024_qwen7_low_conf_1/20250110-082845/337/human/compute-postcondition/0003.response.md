The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `max_balls`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `mask`, `a`, `MOD`, or `total_value`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `mask` is 0, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 5000, `MOD` is 998244353, `total_value` is 0, `max_balls` is 0**
