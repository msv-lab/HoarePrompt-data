Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop requires `n` to be a positive integer because `range(n)` will run from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Given the initial state, `n` is already an integer between 1 and 5000.

3. **Variables `mask`, `a`, `MOD`, `total_value`, and `max_balls`:**
   - These variables are not directly involved in the loop condition but will be used within the loop body.
   - Since the problem does not specify any conditions on these variables for the loop to execute, we don't need to adjust them for the loop to start.

Based on the above analysis, the only state adjustment needed is ensuring that `i` starts at 0 and the loop can execute as long as `i < n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `i` is 0**
