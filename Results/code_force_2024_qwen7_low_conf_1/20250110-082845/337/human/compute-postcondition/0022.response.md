Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - `mask` is `mask + 1`, meaning `mask` has incremented by 1.
   - The i-th bit of `mask` is checked using `mask & 1 << i != 0`.
   - If the i-th bit is set, `max_balls` is set to `a[i]` if `a[i] > 0`, otherwise `max_balls` is set to `0`.
   - `total_value` remains unchanged.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `range(n)`, the value of `i` will increase by 1 each iteration.
   - If `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k+1`.

3. **Check the New Bit in `mask`:**
   - The new bit to check is the `(i+1)`-th bit of `mask`.

4. **Update the State:**
   - If the `(i+1)`-th bit of `mask` is set (`mask & 1 << (i+1) != 0`), then `max_balls` is updated similarly to the previous state.
   - If the `(i+1)`-th bit is not set, `max_balls` remains unchanged.
   - `total_value` remains unchanged.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mask` is `mask + 2` (incremented by 1 from the previous state), if the `(i+1)`-th bit of `mask` is set, then `max_balls` is set to `a[i+1]` if `a[i+1] > 0`, otherwise `0`. `total_value` remains unchanged and `n` must be greater than 0.**
