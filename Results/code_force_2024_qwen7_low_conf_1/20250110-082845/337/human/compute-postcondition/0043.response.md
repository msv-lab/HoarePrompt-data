The code `total_value = (total_value + max_balls) % MOD` updates the value of `total_value` by adding `max_balls` to it and then taking modulo `MOD`. The variables `mask` and `max_balls` are not directly affected by this line of code, so their values remain unchanged.

The previous value of `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`, which means `total_value` is updated to this new value. 

Output State: **`mask` is `mask + n`, `max_balls` is the maximum value among the bits in `mask` that are set, `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`**
