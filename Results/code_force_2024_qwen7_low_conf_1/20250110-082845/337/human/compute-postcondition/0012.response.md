The code updates `max_balls` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`, where `i` is 2. Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is 2, and `max_balls` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[1]` (since the condition `mask & 1 << 1` must be true for the if part to execute), the code will update `max_balls` to be the maximum of `max_balls` and `a[2]`.

Since the exact value of `a[2]` is not specified, the only thing we can definitively say is that `max_balls` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[2]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is 2, `max_balls` is the maximum of its current value and `a[2]`**
