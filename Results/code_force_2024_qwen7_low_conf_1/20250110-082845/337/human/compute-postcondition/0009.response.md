The code snippet updates `max_balls` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`. However, the variable `a` and its content are not defined in the initial state, and the variable `mask` is also not defined. Given the conditions, the only variable that gets updated is `max_balls`, which now holds the maximum value between its current value and `a[i]`.

Since `i` is initially set to 1, the value of `a[1]` will be considered for updating `max_balls`. The value of `max_balls` could be any integer from the initial state, but it will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is 1, `max_balls` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[1]`.**
