The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 5000.

After executing the function body, the function returns `total_value`, which is the sum of all elements that were originally present in the variable 'total'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, compute the sum of all elements in `a`, and return this sum as `total_value`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns the sum of all elements in `a`.**
