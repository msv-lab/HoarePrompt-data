According to the code, the loop iterates over all possible values of `mask` from `0` to `(1 << n) - 1`. The loop starts with `mask` as `0` and increments `mask` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `mask` is `mask + n - 1`
- `max_balls` is the maximum value among `a[i]` where `mask & 1 << i` is true
- `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`
- `n` is greater than 0

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `mask` to be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Value of `mask`**: The initial value of `mask` in the first iteration is `0`.
2. **Incrementing `mask`**: In each iteration, `mask` is incremented by 1. So, if the previous value of `mask` was `mask_prev`, the new value of `mask` will be `mask_prev + 1`.

Given that the previous value of `mask` was `mask + n - 1`, the next value of `mask` will be:
\[ \text{new\_mask} = (\text{mask} + n - 1) + 1 = \text{mask} + n \]

Since `mask` is incremented by `n`, the new value of `mask` should be checked to ensure it is still within the range `[0, (1 << n) - 1]`.

The other states (`max_balls`, `total_value`, and `n`) remain unchanged because the loop body does not modify them.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `mask` is `mask + n`
- `max_balls` remains the same
- `total_value` remains the same
- `n` remains the same

State: **`mask` is `mask + n`, `max_balls` is the maximum value among `a[i]` where `mask & 1 << i` is true, `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`, and `n` is greater than 0**
