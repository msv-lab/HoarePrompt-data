The code updates the value of `max_balls` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`. The initial state is given as follows:
- `mask` is `mask + n`
- `max_balls` is 0
- `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD`
- `n` is greater than 0
- The bit at position `i` in `mask` is set.

After executing the code snippet, `max_balls` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `a[i]`. Since `max_balls` was initially 0, it will be updated to `a[i]`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `max_balls` is now `a[i]`
- All other variables (`mask`, `total_value`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mask` is `mask + n`, `max_balls` is `a[i]`, `total_value` is `(total_value + 0) % MOD`, and `n` is greater than 0.**
