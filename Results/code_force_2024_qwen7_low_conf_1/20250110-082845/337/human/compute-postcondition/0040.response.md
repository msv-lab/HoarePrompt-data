The code `max_balls = max(max_balls, a[i])` updates the value of `max_balls` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`. The value of `max_balls` is determined by the condition involving `a[j + 1]` and `mask`, but this code does not depend on those conditions. Therefore, the value of `max_balls` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`.

The states of the other variables (`mask`, `total_value`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`mask` is `mask + n`, `max_balls` is the maximum of `max_balls` and `a[i]`, `total_value` is `(total_value + max_balls) % MOD` if the bit at position `j + 1` in `mask` is set, otherwise `total_value` remains the same**
