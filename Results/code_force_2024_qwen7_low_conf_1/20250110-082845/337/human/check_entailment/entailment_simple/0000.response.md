Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of colors `n` and the number of balls for each color `a`.
   - It processes the input within the specified constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 5000` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000`).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the sum of values over all \(2^n\) possible sets of colors.
   - It uses bitwise operations to iterate through all possible subsets of the colors (represented by `mask`).
   - For each subset, it determines the maximum number of balls for the subset, which corresponds to the minimum number of groups needed for that subset.
   - The result is accumulated and returned modulo \(998244353\).

3. **Logical Correctness:**
   - The program correctly computes the value for each subset of colors as the maximum number of balls in that subset.
   - The sum of these values is computed correctly and returned modulo \(998244353\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the empty set correctly, where the value is \(0\).
   - It correctly handles cases where the subset contains one or more colors.
   - It correctly handles the constraints on the number of colors and the number of balls.

Since the program correctly implements the described algorithm and logic without any missing or incorrect steps, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
