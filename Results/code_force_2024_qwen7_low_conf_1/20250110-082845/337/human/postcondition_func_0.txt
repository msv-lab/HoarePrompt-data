The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in `a` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\). It calculates and returns the sum of the maximum values of all possible non-empty subsets of `a`. This is achieved through a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over all possible bit masks (subsets) of the list `a`, and the inner loop determines the maximum value for each subset represented by the current bit mask. The result is accumulated in `total_value`, which is then returned modulo \(998244353\).
