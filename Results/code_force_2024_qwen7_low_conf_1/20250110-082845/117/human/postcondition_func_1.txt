The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads two inputs: `n` (a positive integer) and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B'). It then calls `func_1(n, s)` to count the number of 'B' characters in `s` for each test case and stores these counts in a list named `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in `results`. If `t` is less than the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the function still executes as long as `t` is a positive integer. The function does not accept any parameters directly and does not return any value.
