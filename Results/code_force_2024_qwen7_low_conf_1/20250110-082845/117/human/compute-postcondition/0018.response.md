`b` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'; `a` is the integer entered by the user; `b` is the string entered by the user; `c` is the reversed string of `b`, and `b` is the input string from the user.**
