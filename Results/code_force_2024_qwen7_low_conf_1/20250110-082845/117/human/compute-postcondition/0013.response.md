The code snippet `print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))` performs the following operations:

1. `c.index('B')` finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the reversed string `c`.
2. `b.index('B')` finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `b`.
3. The result of the expression `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')` is printed.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are dependent on user input or some previous state, and these values are not specified, we can only express the final result in terms of these variables. However, we can still provide the output state based on the given conditions.

The initial state includes:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'
- `a` is an integer
- `b` is the string entered by the user
- `c` is the reversed string of `b`

The code does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, and `s`. It calculates and prints the value of `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', the value of `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')` is printed.**
