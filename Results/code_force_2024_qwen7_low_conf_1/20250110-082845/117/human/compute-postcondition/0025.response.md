Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a string `b` (which is the same as `s`), reverses the string `b`, and checks if the count of 'B' characters in the reversed string `c` is greater than 1. If it is, the function prints `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. If the count is not greater than 1, it simply prints `a`. There is no explicit return value; the function prints the result for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `b` contains only one 'B' or no 'B', in which case the function will always print `a`. Additionally, the function assumes that the input constraints are met (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 10`, and `s` contains at least one 'B'), and it does not handle cases where these constraints might not be satisfied.**
