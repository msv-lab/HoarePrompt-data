Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is an input integer, `c` is the reversed string of `b` and converted to a string type. The current count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1.***
