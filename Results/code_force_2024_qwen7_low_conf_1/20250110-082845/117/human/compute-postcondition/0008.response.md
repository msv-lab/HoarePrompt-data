Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is an integer, `c` is the reversed string of `b` and converted to a string type. If `c.count('B') > 1`, the output of the print statement is `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. If `c.count('B') \(\leq\) 1`, the output of the print statement is `a`.**
