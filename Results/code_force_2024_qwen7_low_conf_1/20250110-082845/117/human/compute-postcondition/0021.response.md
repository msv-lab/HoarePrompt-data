The code `print(a)` simply prints the value of `a`. The value of `a` is an integer entered by the user, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the fact that `a` has been printed, but its specific value is not known since it depends on the user's input. However, we can state that `a` is an integer entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is the string entered by the user, `c` is the reversed string of `b`. The value of `a` has been printed.**
