`a` is assigned the value of the newly entered integer using `int(input())`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'; `a` is the integer entered by the user; `b` is the string entered by the user; `c` is the reversed string of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\); `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'; `a` is the integer entered by the user; `b` is the string entered by the user; `c` is the reversed string of `b`.**
