Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved**: The variables involved in the for loop are `t`, `n`, and `s`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each test case defined by the variable `t`. This means the loop will run as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Loop Execution Requirement**: For each iteration of the loop, the following conditions must hold:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\).
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', and at least one character is 'B'.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop runs for each test case defined by `t`, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Within each test case, `n` must be within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10\).
   - For the string `s`, it must have a length `n` and consist only of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'**.
