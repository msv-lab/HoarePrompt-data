The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, it implies that the function processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `t` (such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), a positive integer `n` (such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\)), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'.

The function returns different values based on the input for each test case:
- Case_1: For each test case, the function processes `t`, `n`, and `s`.
- Case_2: The function returns a specific value or result for each test case based on the given constraints and the string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', and return a specific value or result for each test case.
