`a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `a` is now an integer entered by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `c`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is an integer, `c` is the reversed string of `b` and converted to a string type, `a` is an integer entered by the user.**
