Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is an integer, `b` is the string entered by the user, `c` is the reversed string of `b`. If the reversed string `c` has more than one 'B', the value of `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `a` is printed.***
