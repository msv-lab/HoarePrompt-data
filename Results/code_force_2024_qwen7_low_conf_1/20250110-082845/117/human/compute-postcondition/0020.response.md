The code snippet prints the value of `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. Here, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is a string entered by the user, and `c` is the reversed string of `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are not affected by this code.

- `a` is an integer entered by the user.
- `b` is a string entered by the user.
- `c` is the reversed string of `b`.

The index of 'B' in `b` and `c` will be calculated and subtracted from `a`. Since the exact values of `b` and `a` are not specified, we will keep them as they are.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is the integer entered by the user, `b` is the string entered by the user, `c` is the reversed string of `b`, and the output is `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`.**
