The code `c = str(b[-1::-1])` reverses the string `b` and converts it to a string type. Since `b` is an input string, its original value is not specified, but it will be reversed and stored in `c`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is an input integer, `c` is the reversed string of `b` and converted to a string type**.
