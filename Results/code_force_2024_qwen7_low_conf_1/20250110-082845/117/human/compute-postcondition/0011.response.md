`b` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `b` now holds the string entered by the user. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is an integer, `c` is the reversed string of `b` and converted to a string type, `b` is the string entered by the user.**
