Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is the string entered by the user, `c` is the reversed string of `b`. After all iterations of the loop, if the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1 for any iteration, the output will be the difference `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')` for that iteration, otherwise, `a` will be printed for all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for each test case defined by `t`.
- For each test case, `n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are defined.
- The condition `c.count('B') > 1` checks if there are more than one 'B' in the reversed string `c`.
- If this condition is true, `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')` is printed.
- If this condition is false, `a` is printed.
- Since the loop runs for each test case and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on user input, the final values of these variables will reflect the last iteration's inputs unless the condition `c.count('B') > 1` was met in any previous iteration, in which case the output will be the value calculated from that iteration.
