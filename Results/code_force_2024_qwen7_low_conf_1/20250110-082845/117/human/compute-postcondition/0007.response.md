The code `print(a)` simply prints the value of the variable `a`. This does not change the value of `a` or any other variable. The other variables remain in their initial states as per the initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is printed, `c` is the reversed string of `b` and converted to a string type, and the count of 'B' in `c` is less than or equal to 1**
