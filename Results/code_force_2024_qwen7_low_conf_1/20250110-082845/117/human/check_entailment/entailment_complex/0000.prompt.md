You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = input()
        
        c = str(b[-1::-1])
        
        if c.count('B') > 1:
            print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is the string entered by the user, `c` is the reversed string of `b`. After all iterations of the loop, if the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1 for any iteration, the output will be the difference `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')` for that iteration, otherwise, `a` will be printed for all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a string `b` (which is the same as `s`), reverses the string `b`, and checks if the count of 'B' characters in the reversed string `c` is greater than 1. If it is, the function prints `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. If the count is not greater than 1, it simply prints `a`. There is no explicit return value; the function prints the result for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `b` contains only one 'B' or no 'B', in which case the function will always print `a`. Additionally, the function assumes that the input constraints are met (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 10`, and `s` contains at least one 'B'), and it does not handle cases where these constraints might not be satisfied.
