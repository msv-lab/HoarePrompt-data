Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program tries to reverse the string and count the index of the last 'B', but this approach fails to handle several edge cases:

1. **Single Black Cell Case**: For a strip like "BB", the program should output 2, but it outputs 1 because it incorrectly handles the reversal and counting.
2. **Multiple Segments of Black Cells**: For a strip like "BWWB", the program should output 4, but it outputs 2 because it only considers the last 'B' and the first 'B'.

Here's a counterexample:
- **Input**:  
```
4
BWWB
```
- **Expected Output**: `4`
- **Actual Output**: `2`

The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum segment length needed to turn all cells white in such cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
