Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The goal is to find the minimum length of a segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.
   - The solution should consider the positions of black cells ('B') and ensure that the minimum segment length covers all black cells.

2. **Given Program**:
   - The program calculates the index of the last 'B' and the first 'B' in the string and uses these indices to compute the segment length.
   - Specifically, the code:
     ```python
     c = str(b[-1::-1])
     if c.count('B') > 1:
         print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))
     else:
         print(a)
     ```
   - This approach does not correctly determine the minimum segment length needed to turn all cells white.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case "WBBWBW" (6 cells). According to the problem, the minimum length is 4, as painting from the 2nd to the 5th cell turns all cells white.
   - However, the program would reverse the string to "WBWBWW" and find the indices of the first and last 'B' (which are 1 and 5 respectively), then calculate `6 - 5 - 1 = 0`, which is incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this correctly, one should identify the first and last occurrence of 'B' and compute the distance between them plus one (since both ends need to be included in the segment).
   - The correct logic would be:
     ```python
     first_b = b.find('B')
     last_b = b.rfind('B')
     print(last_b - first_b + 1)
     ```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum segment length required to turn all cells white. Therefore, the program is **False** according to the problem description.
