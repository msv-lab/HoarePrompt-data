You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

# Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = input()
        c = str(b[-1::-1])
        if c.count('B') > 1:
            print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))
        else:
            print(a)





# Execution Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a string `b` (which is the same as `s`), reverses the string `b`, and checks if the count of 'B' characters in the reversed string `c` is greater than 1. If it is, the function prints `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. If the count is not greater than 1, it simply prints `a`. There is no explicit return value; the function prints the result for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `b` contains only one 'B' or no 'B', in which case the function will always print `a`. Additionally, the function assumes that the input constraints are met (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 10`, and `s` contains at least one 'B'), and it does not handle cases where these constraints might not be satisfied.
