You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: You have been asked to organize a very important art conference. The first
step is to choose the dates.

The conference must last for a certain number of consecutive days. Each day,
one lecturer must perform, and the same lecturer cannot perform more than
once.

You asked n potential lecturers if they could participate in the conference.
Lecturer i indicated that they could perform on any day from l_i to r_i
inclusive.

A certain segment of days can be chosen as the conference dates if there is a
way to assign an available lecturer to each day of the segment, assigning each
lecturer to no more than one day.

For each k from 1 to n , find how many ways there are to choose a segment of k
consecutive days as the conference dates.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer n — the number of potential
lecturers (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ).

Each of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i — the segment of
available days for the i th lecturer (1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ).

Output

Print n integers, where the k th number denotes the number of ways to select a
segment of k consecutive days as conference dates.

Note

In the first testcase, a one-day conference can be organized on any of the
days from 1 to 6 . A two-day conference can be organized from day 2 to day 3 ,
as well as from day 4 to day 5 .

In the second testcase, five lecturers can perform only from day 1 to day 3 ,
so it will not be possible to organize a conference longer than three days.

```
def func_1(n, lecturers):
```
