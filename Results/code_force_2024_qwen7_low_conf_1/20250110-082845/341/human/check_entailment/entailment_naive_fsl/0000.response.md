Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple lecturers available on the same day. The current implementation assumes that availability is cumulative, but it does not ensure that the same lecturer is not assigned to more than one day. Specifically, the `available_days` array is updated based on the availability ranges of lecturers, but it does not prevent overlapping assignments.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 3
1 3
1 3
1 3
1 3
```

The output should be:

```
3
2
1
0
0
```

However, the provided program might not correctly handle this case due to the way availability is accumulated. The correct approach would involve maintaining a set of available lecturers for each day and ensuring that each day is assigned to a unique lecturer within the given constraints.
