You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have been asked to organize a very important art conference. The first
step is to choose the dates.

The conference must last for a certain number of consecutive days. Each day,
one lecturer must perform, and the same lecturer cannot perform more than
once.

You asked n potential lecturers if they could participate in the conference.
Lecturer i indicated that they could perform on any day from l_i to r_i
inclusive.

A certain segment of days can be chosen as the conference dates if there is a
way to assign an available lecturer to each day of the segment, assigning each
lecturer to no more than one day.

For each k from 1 to n , find how many ways there are to choose a segment of k
consecutive days as the conference dates.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer n — the number of potential
lecturers (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ).

Each of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i — the segment of
available days for the i th lecturer (1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ).

Output

Print n integers, where the k th number denotes the number of ways to select a
segment of k consecutive days as conference dates.

Note

In the first testcase, a one-day conference can be organized on any of the
days from 1 to 6 . A two-day conference can be organized from day 2 to day 3 ,
as well as from day 4 to day 5 .

In the second testcase, five lecturers can perform only from day 1 to day 3 ,
so it will not be possible to organize a conference longer than three days.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `result[k]` is the number of windows of size `k` where the sum of the available lecturers is at least `k`, `lecturers`, `availability`, `current_available`, `available_days`, `max_day`, and `k` remain unchanged.
    return result[1:]
    #`The program returns a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the number of windows of size `k` (from 1 to `n`) where the sum of the available lecturers is at least `k`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, and `lecturers`, a list of tuples where each tuple `(l_i, r_i)` represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer. The function calculates and returns a list of `n` integers, where each integer represents the number of windows of size `k` (from 1 to `n`) where the sum of the available lecturers is at least `k`. 

After processing, the function performs the following steps:
1. It initializes a list `availability` to track the net number of lecturers available on each day within the range from 1 to 200,000.
2. It updates the `availability` list based on the ranges provided by the lecturers.
3. It computes the cumulative sum of available lecturers up to each day and stores these values in the `available_days` list.
4. For each window size `k` from 1 to `n`, it counts the number of contiguous subarrays (windows) of length `k` where the sum of available lecturers is at least `k`.
5. Finally, it returns a list containing the count of such windows for each `k` from 1 to `n`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples. If `n` is zero or `lecturers` is empty, the function will still process and return an empty list for `n` if `n > 0`, or an empty list for `n = 0` if `lecturers` is empty.
- The function correctly handles overlapping intervals and negative counts in the `availability` list, ensuring accurate cumulative sums.
- All necessary logic to handle the given annotations and compute the required results is present. No additional missing functionality is identified.
