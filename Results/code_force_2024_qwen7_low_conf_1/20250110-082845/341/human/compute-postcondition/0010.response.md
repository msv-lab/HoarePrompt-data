The code decrements `availability[r + 1]` by 1. Here, `r` is the second element of the next tuple in `lecturers`. Since `availability[l]` was previously incremented by 1, and `l` is the first element of the next tuple in `lecturers`, these values remain unchanged. The value of `n` is a positive integer, and `lecturers` remains a non-empty list of tuples.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples with at least two tuples, `availability[l]` is incremented by 1, `l` is the first element of the next tuple in `lecturers`, `r` is the second element of the next tuple in `lecturers`, `availability[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
