Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1:k + 1]`.
- `count` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `result[2]` is yet to be calculated.
- `available_days`, `start`, and `k` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for start in range(2, max_day - k + 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Range of `start`:**
   - The loop iterates over `start` from `2` to `max_day - k + 2`.

2. **Initial State of `start`:**
   - The initial value of `start` should be within the range `[2, max_day - k + 2]`.

3. **Variables that Change within the Loop:**
   - `current_window_sum` will change as `start` changes.
   - `count` will also change based on the new value of `current_window_sum`.

4. **Initialization of `result[2]`:**
   - Since `result[2]` is yet to be calculated, we need to ensure that it gets updated during the loop.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `available_days`, `start`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

### Adjusted States:
- `start` must be initialized to `2` (the starting point of the loop).
- `current_window_sum` and `count` will be recalculated for each new value of `start`.
- `result[2]` needs to be calculated and stored after each iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1:k + 1]`, `count` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, `start` is 2, `result[2]` is yet to be calculated, and `available_days` and `k` remain unchanged.**

So, the final state before the loop starts is:
```
State: **`current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1:k + 1]`, `count` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, `start` is 2, `result[2]` is yet to be calculated, and `available_days` and `k` remain unchanged.**
