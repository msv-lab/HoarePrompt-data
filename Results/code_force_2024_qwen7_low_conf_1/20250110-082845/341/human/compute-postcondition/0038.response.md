`count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_window_sum` is updated by adding `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]`; `available_days` remains unchanged; `start` is now `start + 1`; `k` remains unchanged; and `count` is incremented by 1.
