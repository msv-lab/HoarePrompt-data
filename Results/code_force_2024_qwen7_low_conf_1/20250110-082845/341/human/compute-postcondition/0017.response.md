According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `day` and `max_day`. The loop iterates from `1` to `max_day + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `day` is the current value of the loop variable, and it should be incremented to the next value for the loop to continue.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (this does not change within the loop)
- `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples (this does not change within the loop)
- `availability` is a list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day (this does not change within the loop)
- `current_available` is `availability[day]` (this value changes with each iteration)
- `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1` where the value at index `day` is now `current_available` (this list is updated with each iteration)
- `max_day` is a positive integer (this does not change within the loop)

At the end of the last iteration:
- `day` is the current value, which means the loop has just completed for this `day`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `day` must be incremented to the next value, which would be `day + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `day` will be `day + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day, `current_available` is `availability[day + 1]`, `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1` where the value at index `day + 1` is now `current_available`, `max_day` is a positive integer**
