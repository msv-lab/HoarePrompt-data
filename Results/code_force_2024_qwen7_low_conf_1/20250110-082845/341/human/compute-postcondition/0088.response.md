The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, and `lecturers`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple (l_i, r_i) represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer, with 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 2⋅10^5. The function returns a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the number of windows of size `k` (from 1 to `n`) where the sum of the available lecturers is at least `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer) and `lecturers` (a list of tuples), and returns a list of `n` integers indicating the number of windows of size `k` (from 1 to `n`) where the sum of the available lecturers is at least `k`.**
