Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `max(m, n) > 1` and `ans` is undefined.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop is defined as `for i in range(max(m, n), 0, -1)`.

3. **Loop Execution**: 
   - The loop starts from `max(m, n)` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches 0.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be greater than 0.

4. **Determining `i` at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's denote `k = max(m, n)`.
   - At the start of the first iteration, `i` would be `k`.
   - After each iteration, `i` decreases by 1.
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `k - 1`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Continues**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than 0.
   - Hence, `k - 1 > 0`, which simplifies to `k > 1`.
   - Since `k = max(m, n)`, it means `max(m, n) > 1`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `max(m, n)` remains the same since the condition `max(m, n) > 1` must still hold.
   - `i` is now `k - 1` (or `max(m, n) - 1`).
   - `ans` is still undefined because the loop body is omitted, and no assignment to `ans` has occurred yet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`max(m, n) > 1`, `i` is `max(m, n) - 1`, `ans` is undefined.**

State: **`max(m, n) > 1`, `i` is `max(m, n) - 1`, `ans` is undefined**
