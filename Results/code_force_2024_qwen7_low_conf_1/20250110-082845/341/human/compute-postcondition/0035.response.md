Postcondition: ***`current_window_sum` is updated by adding the value of `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged. If `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, `count` is incremented by 1.***
