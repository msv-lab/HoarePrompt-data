To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and analyze the loop condition.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples.
- `availability` is a list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day.
- `current_available` is `availability[day + 1] + availability[day]`.
- `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1` where the value at index `day` is now `availability[day + 1] + availability[day]`.
- `max_day` is a positive integer.

The loop iterates over `day` from `1` to `max_day + 1` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- The loop variable `day` was incremented by 1, so if the loop is about to execute again, `day` will be `day + 1`.

Since the loop runs from `1` to `max_day + 1`, the loop will continue as long as `day < max_day + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- Let's assume `day` was `k` (where `1 <= k <= max_day`).
- For the loop to execute again, `day` must be less than `max_day + 1`, so `day` must be `k + 1`.

Therefore, we need to update the state such that `day` is `k + 1`.

The state remains the same for `n`, `lecturers`, `availability`, `current_available`, `available_days`, and `max_day` since these values do not change within the loop.

So, the state adjustment needed is:
- `day` must be `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `day` at the end of the previous iteration).

Let's represent this:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day, `current_available` is `availability[day + 1] + availability[day]`, `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1` where the value at index `day` is now `availability[day + 1] + availability[day]`, `max_day` is a positive integer, `day` is `day + 1`**
