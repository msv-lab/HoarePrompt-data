Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute.

1. **Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `n`: A positive integer.
   - `lecturers`: A non-empty list of tuples.
   - `availability`: A list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day, with indices ranging from 1 to 200000.
   - `current_available`: An integer set to 0.
   - `available_days`: A list of zeros with a length of `max_day + 1`.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for day in range(1, max_day + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each day from 1 to `max_day`.
   - Each iteration updates the `current_available` variable based on the availability of lecturers for that specific day.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, the range of the loop (`range(1, max_day + 1)`) must be valid.
   - The `max_day` must be a positive integer because the loop starts from 1 up to `max_day + 1`.

Given these points, let's formulate the required state adjustments:

- The `max_day` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) to ensure that there are days to iterate over.
- The `current_available` should be initialized to 0, as stated in the problem.
- The `available_days` list should be initialized to a list of zeros with a length of `max_day + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day, `current_available` is 0, `available_days` is a list of zeros with length `max_day + 1`, `max_day` must be a positive integer**
