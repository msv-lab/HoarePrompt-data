The code `print(ans[i])` prints the value of `ans[i]`, but does not change the value of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\), `nnn` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, and `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is already computed; `ans[i]` is printed.**
