The code `d[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `d[r + 1]` by 1. The previous value of `r` is unknown, but it does not affect the other variables. Thus, the Output State is: `nnn` is 0, `i` is within the range `[1, n + 1]`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `pq` is a heap queue containing elements greater than or equal to `i` and is empty if no elements were pushed, `b[l] = r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1.
