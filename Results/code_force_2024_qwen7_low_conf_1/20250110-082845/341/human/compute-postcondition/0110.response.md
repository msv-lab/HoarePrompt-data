`c[r]` is incremented by 1. Since `r` is the second element of `a[i]`, `c[r]` was originally increased by 2 in the previous state, so now `c[r]` will be `c[r] + 1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nnn` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered; `b[l]` is `r`; `c[r]` is increased by 3; `d[r + 1]` is its original value; `d[l]` is incremented by 2; `l` is the first element of `a[i]`; `r` is the second element of `a[i]`.**
