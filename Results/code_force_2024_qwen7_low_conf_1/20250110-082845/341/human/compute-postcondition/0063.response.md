Postcondition: ***`current_window_sum` is updated to its old value plus `available_days[start + k - 1]` minus `available_days[start - 1]`; `count` is 3 if the updated `current_window_sum` was at least `k` and is incremented by 1, otherwise `count` is 2; `result[k]` is 1 if the updated `current_window_sum` is at least `k`, otherwise `result[k]` is 0; `available_days` remains unchanged; `k` remains unchanged; `start` is `max_day - k + 3` and must be between 2 and `max_day - k + 3` inclusive.***
