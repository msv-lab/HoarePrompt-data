The code initializes a list `availability` with zeros, where the length of the list is `max_day + 2`. This means the list will have 200002 elements, all initialized to 0. The variables `n` and `lecturers` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, `lecturers` is a list of tuples where each tuple (l_i, r_i) represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer, with 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 2⋅10^5, `max_day` is 200000, `availability` is a list of 200002 zeros**
