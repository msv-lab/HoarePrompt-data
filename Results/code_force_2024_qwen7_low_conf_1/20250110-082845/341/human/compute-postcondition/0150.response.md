`j` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is `m - 1`, and the value of `s` depends on the value of `b[j]`. If `b[j]` was `True` before the decrement, then `s` was `s + c[m - 1] - 1`; if `b[j]` was `False`, then `s` was `s + c[m - 1]`. After decrementing `j`, the new value of `j` is `m - 2` (since `j` was initially `m - 1`).

Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `s` is `s + c[m - 1] - 1` if `b[j]` is `True` and `s + c[m - 1]` if `b[j]` is `False`**
