The code `c[r] += 1` increments the value of `c[r]` by 1. The value of `r` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, which is stored in `m`. Since `c[r]` is being incremented, the value of `c[r]` changes from its previous value to the new value plus 1.

The states of the other variables (`nnn`, `i`, `m`, `pq`, and `b[l] = r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is within the range `[1, n + 1]`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `pq` is a heap queue containing elements greater than or equal to `i` and is empty if no elements were pushed, `b[l] = r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1**
