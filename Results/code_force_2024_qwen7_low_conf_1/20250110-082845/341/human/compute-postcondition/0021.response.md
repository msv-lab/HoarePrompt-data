`current_available` is incremented by `availability[day]`. The previous value of `current_available` was `availability[day + 1] + availability[day]`. After adding `availability[day]`, the new value of `current_available` becomes `availability[day + 1] + availability[day] + availability[day]`, which simplifies to `availability[day + 1] + 2 * availability[day]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day, `current_available` is `availability[day + 1] + 2 * availability[day]`, `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1` where the value at index `day` is now `availability[day + 1] + availability[day]`, `max_day` is a positive integer, `day` is `day + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day, `current_available` is `availability[day + 1] + 2 * availability[day]`, `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1` where the value at index `day` is now `availability[day + 1] + availability[day]`, `max_day` is a positive integer, `day` is `day + 1**.
