The code updates the value of `available_days[day]` to be equal to `current_available`. From the initial state, we know that:

- `current_available` is defined as `availability[day + 1] + 2 * availability[day]`.
- `available_days[day]` is currently `availability[day + 1] + availability[day]`.

Since the code sets `available_days[day]` to `current_available`, we can substitute the expression for `current_available` into the assignment. Thus, `available_days[day]` will be updated to `availability[day + 1] + 2 * availability[day]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day, `current_available` is `availability[day + 1] + 2 * availability[day]`, `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1` where the value at index `day` is now `availability[day + 1] + 2 * availability[day]`, `max_day` is a positive integer, `day` is `day + 1**
