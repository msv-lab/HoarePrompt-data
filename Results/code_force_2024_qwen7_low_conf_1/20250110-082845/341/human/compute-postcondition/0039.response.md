Postcondition: ***`current_window_sum` is updated by adding `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]`; `available_days` remains unchanged; `start` is now `start + 1`; `k` remains unchanged; and `count` is incremented by 1 if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, these variables retain their states as described in the precondition.***
