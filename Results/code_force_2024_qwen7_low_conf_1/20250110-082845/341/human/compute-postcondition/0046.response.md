Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `current_window_sum` is a cumulative sum of `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]` for all valid `start` values.
   - `count` is the number of times `current_window_sum` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.
   - `result[k]` is equal to `count`.
   - `available_days` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `start` is `max_day - k + 2`.
   - The loop will stop if `start` exceeds `max_day - k + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - For each `k`, the loop calculates `current_window_sum` and updates `count` based on whether `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `result[k]` is set to `count` at the end of each iteration.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `start` is `max_day - k + 2`.
   - The loop will stop if `start` exceeds `max_day - k + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - To continue the loop, `start` must be less than or equal to `max_day - k + 1`.
   - Since `start` is `max_day - k + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to decrement `start` to `max_day - k + 1` for the next iteration.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is the outer loop variable.
   - `current_window_sum` and `count` will be recalculated based on the new value of `start`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `current_window_sum` remains unchanged as it is calculated for the current `k` and does not depend on the value of `start` directly (it is calculated based on `start` and `k`).
   - `count` will be updated based on the new `current_window_sum` and the new value of `start`.
   - `result[k]` will be updated to the new value of `count`.
   - `available_days` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `start` needs to be adjusted to `max_day - k + 1`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `current_window_sum` remains the same as it is calculated for the current `k`.
   - `count` will be the new value after recalculating `current_window_sum` for `start = max_day - k + 1`.
   - `result[k]` will be updated to this new count.
   - `available_days` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `start` is now `max_day - k + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`current_window_sum` remains unchanged, `count` is the new value after recalculating `current_window_sum` for `start = max_day - k + 1`, `result[k]` is updated to this new count, `available_days` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `start` is `max_day - k + 1`**.
