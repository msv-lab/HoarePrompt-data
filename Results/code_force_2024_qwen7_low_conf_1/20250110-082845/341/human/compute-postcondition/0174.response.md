The code `print(ans[i])` prints the value of `ans[i]` where `i` is 1. This does not change any variable's value but outputs the value of `ans[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\), `nnn` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is already computed, `i` is 1; ans[1] is printed.**
