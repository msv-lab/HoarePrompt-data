Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, and `lecturers`, a list of tuples where each tuple `(l_i, r_i)` represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer. The function calculates and returns a list of `n` integers, where each integer represents the number of windows of size `k` (from 1 to `n`) where the sum of the available lecturers is at least `k`. 

After processing, the function performs the following steps:
1. It initializes a list `availability` to track the net number of lecturers available on each day within the range from 1 to 200,000.
2. It updates the `availability` list based on the ranges provided by the lecturers.
3. It computes the cumulative sum of available lecturers up to each day and stores these values in the `available_days` list.
4. For each window size `k` from 1 to `n`, it counts the number of contiguous subarrays (windows) of length `k` where the sum of available lecturers is at least `k`.
5. Finally, it returns a list containing the count of such windows for each `k` from 1 to `n`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer and `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples. If `n` is zero or `lecturers` is empty, the function will still process and return an empty list for `n` if `n > 0`, or an empty list for `n = 0` if `lecturers` is empty.
- The function correctly handles overlapping intervals and negative counts in the `availability` list, ensuring accurate cumulative sums.
- All necessary logic to handle the given annotations and compute the required results is present. No additional missing functionality is identified.**
