The code `d[l] += 1` increments the value of `d[l]` by 1. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `l`, we assume `l` is a valid index that exists in the context of the program. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is within the range `[1, n + 1]`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `pq` is a heap queue containing elements greater than or equal to `i` and is empty if no elements were pushed, `b[l] = r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1**
