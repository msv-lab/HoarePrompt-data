The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Since `j` was initially at least `n + 2`, after decrementing, `j` will be at least `n + 1`. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least `n + 1`, `s` is 0 if it was 1, or -1 if it was 0 (decreased by 1)**
