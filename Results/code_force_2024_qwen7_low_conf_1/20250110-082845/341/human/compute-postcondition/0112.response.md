The code snippet `d[r + 1] -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `d[r + 1]`. Based on the initial state, `d[r + 1]` is the original value of `d[r + 1]`, which is unchanged from its initial state. The value of `d[r + 1]` is updated by subtracting 1 from it. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`nnn` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered; `b[l]` is `r`; `c[r]` is increased by 3; `d[r + 1]` is its original value - 1; `d[l]` is incremented by 3; `l` is the first element of `a[i]`; `r` is the second element of `a[i]`**
