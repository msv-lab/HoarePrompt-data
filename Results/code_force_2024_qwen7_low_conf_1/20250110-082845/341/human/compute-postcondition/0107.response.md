Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `nnn` is 0
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered
- `b[l]` is `r`
- `c[r]` is increased by 2
- `d[r + 1]` is its original value
- `d[l]` is incremented by 1
- `d[l]` is incremented by 1

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
2. **Increment of `i`**: After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
3. **Stopping Condition**: The loop will stop when `i` reaches `n + 1`.

Given that the loop just completed an iteration, we know:
- The current value of `i` (let's call it `i_current`) is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote it as `i_current = i_previous + 1`.
- The loop will continue if `i_current < n + 1`.

### Adjusting States:
To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- We need to check if `i_current < n + 1`. If it is true, the loop will continue.
- If `i_current < n + 1`, then the loop will increment `i` again, making `i_current = i_previous + 2`.

Since `i` is `i + 1` at the end of each iteration, and assuming `i` started from 1 (as typical for such loops), the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `i` will be `i + 1` for the next iteration.

### Updated State:
- `nnn` remains 0.
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `m` remains the maximum value of `r` encountered.
- `b[l]` remains `r`.
- `c[r]` is still increased by 2.
- `d[r + 1]` remains its original value.
- `d[l]` is incremented by 2 (since it was incremented by 1 twice).

### Final Answer:
State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `b[l]` is `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 2, `d[r + 1]` is its original value, `d[l]` is incremented by 2**
