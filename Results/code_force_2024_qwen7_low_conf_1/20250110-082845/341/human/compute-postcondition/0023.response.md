Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day, `current_available` is `availability[max_day]`, `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1` where the value at each index `d` (from 1 to `max_day`) is the cumulative sum of `availability` from `d` to `max_day`, `max_day` is a positive integer.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `day = 1` to `day = max_day`.
- During each iteration, `current_available` accumulates the availability values from the current `day` up to `max_day`.
- After the loop completes, `current_available` will be equal to `availability[max_day]` because the loop has processed all days up to `max_day`.
- The `available_days` list will contain the cumulative sum of availability starting from each day up to `max_day`. For instance, `available_days[day]` will store the sum of `availability[day]` to `availability[max_day]`.

In the case the loop does not execute (i.e., when `max_day` is 0), the values of the variables will be:
- `current_available` remains `0`.
- `available_days` is a list of zeros with length `1` (since `max_day + 1 = 1`).

Therefore, the output state captures the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
