The code snippet updates `current_window_sum` by adding the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1]`. However, since the initial values of `current_window_sum`, `available_days`, `start`, and `k` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `current_window_sum`. We only know that `current_window_sum` has been updated by this operation.

Output State: **`current_window_sum` is updated by adding the value of `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged.**
