The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is `m - 1`, so after decrementing, `j` becomes `(m - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `m - 2`. The states of the other variables (`i` and `s`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `m - 1`; `j` is `m - 2`; `s` is less than \(-1` if `b[j]` is `True`, otherwise `s` is `s - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`; `j` is `m - 2`; `s` is less than \(-1` if `b[j]` is `True`, otherwise `s` is `s - 1`.**
