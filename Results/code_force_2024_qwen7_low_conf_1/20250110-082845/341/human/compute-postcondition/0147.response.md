`s` is incremented by the value of `c[i]`. Given that `i` is `m - 1`, the value of `c[i]` is `c[m - 1]`. The values of `j`, `ans[j - i + 1]`, and the condition `j <= m` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated values are `s` becomes `s + c[m - 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `j` is `0`, `s` is `s + c[m - 1]`, `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1 since `j <= m` is true.**
