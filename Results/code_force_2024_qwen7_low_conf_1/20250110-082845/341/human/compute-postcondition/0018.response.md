The code `current_available += availability[day]` updates the value of `current_available` by adding the value of `availability[day]` to it. The value of `current_available` was previously `availability[day + 1]`. After this operation, `current_available` will now be `availability[day + 1] + availability[day]`.

The value of `available_days[day + 1]` is updated to reflect the new value of `current_available`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers representing the net number of lecturers available on each day, `current_available` is `availability[day + 1] + availability[day]`, `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1` where the value at index `day + 1` is now `current_available`, `max_day` is a positive integer**
