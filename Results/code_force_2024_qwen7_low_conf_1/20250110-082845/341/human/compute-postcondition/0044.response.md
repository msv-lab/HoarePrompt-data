Output State: **`current_window_sum` is a cumulative sum of `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]` for all valid `start` values, `count` is the number of times `current_window_sum` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `available_days` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `start` is `max_day - k + 2`, and the loop will stop if `start` exceeds `max_day - k + 1`.**
