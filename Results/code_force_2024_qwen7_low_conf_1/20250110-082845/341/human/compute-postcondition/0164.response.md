According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `max(m, n)` down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was set to 1, meaning `max(m, n)` was equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `max(m, n)` must be greater than 1.

Given that `max(m, n)` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue. This means both `m` and `n` must be adjusted such that their maximum value is greater than 1.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`m` and `n` must be such that max(m, n) > 1**
