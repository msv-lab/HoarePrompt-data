`s` is incremented by the value of `c[i]`. The value of `i` is `m`, so `c[i]` is `c[m]`. The value of `s` was 0 if `b[m]` is `True` and -1 if `b[m]` is `False`. After the increment, the value of `s` will be `c[m]` if `b[m]` is `True` (because 0 + `c[m]` = `c[m]`) and `-1 + c[m]` if `b[m]` is `False`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `ans[j - i + 1]`, and `b[m]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `j` is `m`, `s` is `c[m]` if `b[m]` is `True` and `-1 + c[m]` if `b[m]` is `False`, and `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1 if `j <= m`.**
