The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`vc[i]` is not necessarily empty, `pq` contains all elements that are greater than or equal to `i` and maintains the heap property, `nnn` is 0, `a[n]` remains the same, `m` is greater than `n + 2`, `i` is `pq[0] + 1` if `pq` is not empty, otherwise `i` is `n + 4`, and `pq[0] >= n + 3`; `n` is incremented by 1.**
