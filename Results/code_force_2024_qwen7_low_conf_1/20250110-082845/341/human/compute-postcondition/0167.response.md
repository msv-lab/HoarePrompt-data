The code snippet `ans[i] += ans[i + 1]` attempts to modify the `ans` list. However, there are issues with this line of code because `ans` is currently undefined. In Python, trying to access or modify an undefined list will raise a `NameError`. Since the code does not run successfully due to the undefined `ans`, no changes are made to any variables.

Output State: **`max(m, n) > 1`, `i` is `max(m, n) - 1`, `ans` is undefined**
