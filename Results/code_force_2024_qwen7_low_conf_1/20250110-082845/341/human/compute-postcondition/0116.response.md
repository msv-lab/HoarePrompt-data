Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `nnn` is 0.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered.
- `pq` is an empty heap queue.
- `b[l]` is set to `r` for each `(l, r)` pair in `a`.
- `c[r]` is the count of occurrences of `r` as the second element in pairs `(l, r)`.
- `d[l]` is incremented by 1 for each `l` and `d[r + 1]` is decremented by 1 for each `r + 1`.
- `s` is 0.
- `j` is `m`.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(m, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `m` down to `1` (inclusive).
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is `n + 1`.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `i` is in the range `[m, 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Value of `i`**: 
   - The initial value of `i` is `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` should be at least `m` because the loop iterates downwards from `m` to `1`.

2. **Value of `m`**:
   - `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered.
   - Since `i` must start at `m` or higher, `m` must be at least `1` (since `i` cannot be less than `1`).

3. **Values of `b[l]` and `d[r]`**:
   - These values are set during some previous operations involving `a` and do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.
   - However, they are important for the loop body logic but do not change the loop's starting conditions.

4. **Other Variables (`nnn`, `pq`, `c[r]`, `s`, `j`)**:
   - These variables do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the key conditions are:
- `i` should be at least `m`.
- `m` should be at least `1`.

Therefore, the state to adjust for the loop to execute is:
State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is `n + 1` (must be at least `m`), `m` must be at least 1, `pq` is an empty heap queue, `b[l]` is set to `r` for each `(l, r)` pair in `a`, `c[r]` is the count of occurrences of `r` as the second element in pairs `(l, r)`, `d[l]` is incremented by 1 for each `l` and `d[r + 1]` is decremented by 1 for each `r + 1`, `s` is 0, `j` is `m`**.

However, the critical adjustment is on the values of `i` and `m`:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1` (must be at least `m`), `m` must be at least 1**.
