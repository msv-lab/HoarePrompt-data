The given code snippet `ans[i] += ans[i + 1]` implies that the value of `ans[i]` is being updated by adding the value of `ans[i + 1]` to it. However, the variable `ans` is not defined in the initial state, nor are the indices `i` and `i+1`. Given the initial state and the lack of definition for `ans`, we cannot determine the exact values of `ans[i]` and `ans[i + 1]`. 

Therefore, we can only state that the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to include the value of `ans[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`m` and `n` must be such that max(m, n) >= 0; `ans[i]` is updated to include `ans[i + 1]`**
