`s` is assigned the value of `s + c[i]`. The value of `i` is `n + 1` (which must be at least `m`), and since `m` must be at least 1, `i` is at least 1. However, the exact value of `c[i]` is not provided, so we can only say that `s` is updated by adding `c[i]` to its current value.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1` (at least `m`); `m` is at least 1; `s` is updated by adding `c[i]` to its current value**
