Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `m`
   - `j` is `m - 1`
   - `s` is `c[m] - 1` if `b[m]` is `True` and `-2 + c[m]` if `b[m]` is `False`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as `j >= i` and `s < j - i + 1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is `m` and `j` is `m - 1`, the condition `j >= i` is false because `m - 1` is not greater than or equal to `m`.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute in the current state.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, we need to change the states such that the condition `j >= i` becomes true, or the condition `s < j - i + 1` changes in a way that allows the loop to continue.

5. **Possible Adjustments:**
   - To satisfy `j >= i`, we need to increase `j` or decrease `i`.
   - To satisfy `s < j - i + 1`, we need to adjust `s` or change `j` and `i` such that the inequality holds.

Given the constraints, let's consider the simplest adjustments:
- Increase `j` to be equal to `i` (i.e., `j = m`).
- Decrease `s` such that `s < j - i + 1`.

Since `i` is `m` and `j` is `m - 1`, increasing `j` to `m` will make the condition `j >= i` true.

6. **Adjusting `s`:**
   - If `b[m]` is `True`, then `s = c[m] - 1`.
   - If `b[m]` is `False`, then `s = -2 + c[m]`.
   - In both cases, to ensure `s < j - i + 1` where `j` is now `m` and `i` is `m`, we need `s` to be less than `m - m + 1 = 1`.

Therefore, we need to ensure `s < 1`.

7. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `i` remains `m`.
   - `j` becomes `m`.
   - `s` must be less than 1.

Thus, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `m`, `j` is `m`, `s` must be less than 1**
