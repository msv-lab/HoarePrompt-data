The code prints the value of `ans[i]`. The value of `i` is given as `nnn + 1`. Since the value of `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is already computed, the output state will include the value of `ans[innn + 1]` being printed. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\), `nnn` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is already computed, `i` is `nnn + 1`, and `ans[innn + 1]` is printed.**
