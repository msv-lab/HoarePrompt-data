Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\), `nnn` is the number of iterations the loop executed, and `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is the sum of all `ans[j]` for all \(j > i\).** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State:** The initial state provides that `m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\). The array `ans` is initialized such that `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is updated to be the sum of `ans[j]` for all \(j > i\).

2. **Loop Execution:** The loop iterates from 1 to `nnn + 1`. Each iteration prints the value of `ans[i]` where `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `nnn + 1`.

3. **Final State After Loop Completion:**
   - The loop will execute until `nnn + 1` iterations if the condition `nnn + 1` holds true.
   - After the loop completes, `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 will be fully computed based on the recursive summation defined in the problem statement.
   - Specifically, each `ans[i]` will be the sum of all `ans[j]` for \(j > i\).

4. **Non-Execution Case:** If the loop does not execute (i.e., `nnn = 0`), then `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 remains as initially set according to the problem statement. However, since the problem does not provide the initial state of `ans[i]` other than the update rule, we assume it follows the same rule of being the sum of subsequent elements.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the final state is as described above.
