The initial state is: `i` is `m`, `j` is `m`, `s` is `c[m]` if `b[m]` is `True` and `-1 + c[m]` if `b[m]` is `False`, and `c[m]` must be less than 1.

The code snippet is: `s -= 1 if b[j] else 0`

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The value of `s` depends on the value of `b[m]`. We know that `b[m]` can only be `True` or `False`.
   - If `b[m]` is `True`, then `s` is initially `c[m]`.
   - If `b[m]` is `False`, then `s` is initially `-1 + c[m]`.

2. The code `s -= 1 if b[j] else 0` means that if `b[j]` is `True`, then `s` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

Since `j` is equal to `m`, we need to consider the two cases separately:

- **Case 1: `b[m]` is `True`**
  - Initial value of `s` is `c[m]`.
  - If `b[j]` (which is `b[m]`) is `True`, then `s` is decreased by 1.
  - Therefore, `s` becomes `c[m] - 1`.

- **Case 2: `b[m]` is `False`**
  - Initial value of `s` is `-1 + c[m]`.
  - If `b[j]` (which is `b[m]`) is `False`, then `s` remains `-1 + c[m]`.
  - If `b[j]` (which is `b[m]`) is `True`, then `s` is decreased by 1, so `s` becomes `-1 + c[m] - 1` which simplifies to `-2 + c[m]`.

Therefore, the final state of the variables is:
- `i` is `m`
- `j` is `m`
- `s` is `c[m] - 1` if `b[m]` is `True` and `-2 + c[m]` if `b[m]` is `False`

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `j` is `m`, `s` is `c[m] - 1` if `b[m]` is `True` and `-2 + c[m]` if `b[m]` is `False`**
