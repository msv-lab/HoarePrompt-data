The code initializes the variable `max_day` to 200000. This does not affect the values of `n` or the list `lecturers`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, and `lecturers` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (l_i, r_i) represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer, with 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 2⋅10^5; `max_day` is 200000.**
