Postcondition: **`current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1:k + 1]`, `count` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`. `result[k]` is updated to 0, `available_days` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, and `start` is `max_day - k + 1`.**
