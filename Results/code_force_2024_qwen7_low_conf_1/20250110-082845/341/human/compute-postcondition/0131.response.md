Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `j` is `m`
   - `s` is 0 if `b[m]` is `True` and -1 if `b[m]` is `False`
   - `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1 if `j <= m`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs with `i` in the range from `m` to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each iteration.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is `n + 1` and the loop starts at `m` and decrements, `i` must currently be `m + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will decrease by 1, so `i` will become `m`.
   - `j` remains `m`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be `m` instead of `m + 1`.
   - `j` stays as `m`.
   - The value of `s` remains unchanged based on the condition of `b[m]`.
   - `ans[j - i + 1]` needs to be checked for the updated values of `i` and `j`.

Given these points, let's summarize the new states:

- `i` becomes `m`.
- `j` remains `m`.
- `s` remains 0 if `b[m]` is `True` and -1 if `b[m]` is `False`.
- `ans[j - i + 1]` will be evaluated with `i = m` and `j = m`.

So, the updated states are:

State: **`i` is `m`, `j` is `m`, `s` is 0 if `b[m]` is `True` and -1 if `b[m]` is `False`, and `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1 if `j <= m`.**
