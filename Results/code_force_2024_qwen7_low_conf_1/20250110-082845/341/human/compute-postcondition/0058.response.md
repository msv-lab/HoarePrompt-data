`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `count` was previously 1 (since it is defined to be 1 initially in the context of this problem), so it will now be 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`current_window_sum` is updated to the old value of `current_window_sum` plus `available_days[start + k - 1]` minus `available_days[start - 1]`, `count` is now 2, `result[k]` remains 1 if the updated `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `start` is `max_day - k + 2` and must be between 2 and `max_day - k + 2` inclusive.**
