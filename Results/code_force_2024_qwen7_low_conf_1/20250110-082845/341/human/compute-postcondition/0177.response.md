Functionality: **The function processes a list of tuples representing lecturers' availability periods (start day, end day). It constructs a schedule to determine the number of lecturers available on each day within a given range. Specifically, the function calculates the number of lecturers available on each day and prints these values in reverse order. The function handles the case where the input list might contain up to \(2 \times 10^5\) lecturers. If there are no lecturers available on a particular day, the output for that day is zero. The function also manages edge cases where the start and end days of the availability periods are the same or where the start day is greater than the end day, though the latter scenario is invalid according to the problem constraints.**

- The function reads the number of lecturers \(n\) and their availability periods from the input.
- It initializes data structures to store the availability periods, process them efficiently, and calculate the number of available lecturers on each day.
- It uses a priority queue to efficiently find the earliest available lecturer for each day.
- It updates arrays to count the availability of lecturers on each day and the transitions between days.
- It iterates backward through the days to compute the cumulative number of lecturers available on each day.
- Finally, it prints the number of lecturers available on each day in reverse order.

This functionality ensures that the output accurately reflects the availability of lecturers over the specified range, handling all valid and some potential edge cases as indicated by the code.
