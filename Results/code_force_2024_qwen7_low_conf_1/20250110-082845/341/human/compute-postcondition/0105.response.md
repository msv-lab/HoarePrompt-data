Output State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `b[l]` is `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 2, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1.** 

In this case, the code only increments the value of `d[l]` by 1. Therefore, the increment operation is applied to the existing value of `d[l]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
