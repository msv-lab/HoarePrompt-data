`s` is decremented by 1 if `b[j]` is `False`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The value of `b[j]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `s` after the operation. However, we know that `s` was initially 0 or 1, and it is now decreased by 1 if `b[j]` is `False`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least `n + 2`, `s` is 0 if it was 1, or -1 if it was 0 (decreased by 1)**
