`j` is decremented by 1. The value of `j` was originally `m - 2`, so now `j` is `m - 3`. The values of `i`, `s`, and `b[j]` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `j` is `m - 3`, `s` is `s + c[m - 1] - 1` (if `b[j]` is `True`) or `s + c[m - 1]` (if `b[j]` is `False`) and then decremented by 1 if `b[j]` is `True` to ensure `s` is less than `0`**
