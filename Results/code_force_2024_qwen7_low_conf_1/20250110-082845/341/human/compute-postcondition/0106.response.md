The code `d[r + 1] -= 1` decreases the value of `d[r + 1]` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `d[r + 1]`. However, we know that `d[r + 1]` was previously increased by 1, so its new value will be its original value plus 1 (from the increment) minus 1 (from the decrement).

Output State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `b[l]` is `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 2, `d[r + 1]` is its original value, `d[l]` is incremented by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1.**
