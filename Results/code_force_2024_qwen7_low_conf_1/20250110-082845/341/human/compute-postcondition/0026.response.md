`count` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `k`, `n`, `lecturers`, `availability`, `current_available`, `available_days`, `max_day`, and `result` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers, `current_available` is `availability[max_day]`, `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1`, `max_day` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `count` is 0**
