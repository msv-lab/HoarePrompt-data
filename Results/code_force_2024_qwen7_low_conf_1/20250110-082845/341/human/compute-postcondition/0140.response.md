`s` is initially `-1`. The code updates `s` by subtracting 1 from its current value only if `b[j]` is `False`. Since `j` must be greater than or equal to `m` and `i` is `m`, the value of `b[j]` is unknown, but we know that `s` will be `-2` if `b[j]` is `False` and will remain `-1` if `b[j]` is `True`.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `j` must be greater than or equal to `m`, and `s` is `-2` if `b[j]` is `False` and `-1` if `b[j]` is `True`.**
