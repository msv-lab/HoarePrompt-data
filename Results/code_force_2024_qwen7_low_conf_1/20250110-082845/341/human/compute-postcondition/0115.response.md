`j` is assigned the value of `m`. The value of `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nnn` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `pq` is an empty heap queue, `b[l]` is set to `r` for each `(l, r)` pair in `a`, `c[r]` is the count of occurrences of `r` as the second element in pairs `(l, r)`, `d[l]` is incremented by 1 for each `l` and `d[r + 1]` is decremented by 1 for each `r + 1`, `s` is 0; `j` is `m`.

Output State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `pq` is an empty heap queue, `b[l]` is set to `r` for each `(l, r)` pair in `a`, `c[r]` is the count of occurrences of `r` as the second element in pairs `(l, r)`, `d[l]` is incremented by 1 for each `l` and `d[r + 1]` is decremented by 1 for each `r + 1`, `s` is 0; `j` is `m`.**
