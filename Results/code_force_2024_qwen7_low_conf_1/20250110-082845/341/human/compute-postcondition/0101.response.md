According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is within the range `[1, n + 1]`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `nnn` is 0
- `i` is within the range `[1, n + 1]`
- `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered
- `pq` is a heap queue containing elements greater than or equal to `i` and is empty if no elements were pushed
- `b[l] = r`
- `c[r]` is increased by 1
- `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1
- `d[l]` is incremented by 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `[1, n + 1]` and it must be the next integer in that range.

Given that `i` was within the range `[1, n + 1]` at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the previous value of `i` was `k`. For the loop to continue, `i` must now be `k + 1`.

Since `i` was within the range `[1, n + 1]`, the next value of `i` will also be within this range. Therefore, we can conclude that the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

The other states (`nnn`, `m`, `pq`, `b[l] = r`, `c[r]`, `d[r + 1]`, and `d[l]`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the increment of `i`.

State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was within the range `[1, n + 1]`), `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `pq` is a heap queue containing elements greater than or equal to `i` and is empty if no elements were pushed, `b[l] = r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1**
