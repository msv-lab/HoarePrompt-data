`l` and `r` are assigned the values from the tuple `a[i]`. The variable `i` is within the range `[1, n + 1]`, so the values of `l` and `r` depend on the content of `a[i]`. The states of the other variables (`m`, `pq`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is within the range `[1, n + 1]`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `pq` is a heap queue containing elements greater than or equal to `i` and is empty if no elements were pushed, `l` and `r` are the values from the tuple `a[i]`**
