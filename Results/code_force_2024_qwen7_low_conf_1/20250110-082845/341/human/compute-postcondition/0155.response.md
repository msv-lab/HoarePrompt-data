`s` is decremented by 1 if `b[j]` is `False`, otherwise it remains unchanged. Since `j` is `m - 1`, and the value of `b[j]` is not specified, we cannot determine whether `s` is decremented or not. However, we know that `i` and `j` are both `m - 1`, and `s` is less than \(-1\). If `b[j]` is `False`, then `s` will become `s - 1`; if `b[j]` is `True`, `s` remains the same.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `j` is `m - 1`
- `s` is less than \(-1\)

The output state will depend on the value of `b[j]`:
- If `b[j]` is `False`, then `s` is `s - 1`, which means `s` is now `s - 1` (since `s` was initially less than \(-1\), subtracting 1 will keep it less than \(-1\)).
- If `b[j]` is `True`, then `s` remains the same, which means `s` is still less than \(-1\).

Since the exact value of `b[j]` is not provided, we can only express the final state in terms of `b[j]`.

Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, and `s` is less than \(-1` if `b[j]` is `True`, otherwise `s` is `s - 1`.**
