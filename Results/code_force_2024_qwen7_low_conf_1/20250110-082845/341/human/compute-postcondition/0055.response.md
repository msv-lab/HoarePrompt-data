Postcondition: ***`current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1:k + 1]` excluding `available_days[start - 1]` and including `available_days[start + k - 1]`, `count` is 2 if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count` remains 1, `result[k]` is 1 if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, `available_days` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `start` is `max_day - k + 1` and must be between 2 and `max_day - k + 2` inclusive.***
