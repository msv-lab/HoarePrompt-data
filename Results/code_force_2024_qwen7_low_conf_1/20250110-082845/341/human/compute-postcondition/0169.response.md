Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop**:
   - The loop variable `i` is initialized to 1 and increments up to `nnn`.
   - We know `nnn` is an integer and we need to ensure it's non-negative because the loop condition checks if `i <= nnn`.

2. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\).
   - `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is already updated such that `ans[i]` is the sum of `ans[j]` for all \(j > i\).
   - `ans[0]` is undefined.

3. **Loop condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i <= nnn`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `nnn` must be a non-negative integer (since the loop condition involves `<=`).
   - The value of `i` starts at 1, so `nnn` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.
   - Since `ans[i]` values are pre-computed for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1, no additional changes are needed for these values.

5. **State required for the loop to execute**:
   - `nnn` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `nnn` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.

Given this analysis, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\), `nnn` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, and `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is already computed.**
