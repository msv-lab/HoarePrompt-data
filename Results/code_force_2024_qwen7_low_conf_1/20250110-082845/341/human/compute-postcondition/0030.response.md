Postcondition: ***`k` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers, `current_available` is `availability[max_day]`, `available_days` is a list of integers with length `max_day + 1`, `max_day` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `count` is either 0 or 1 (depending on whether `current_window_sum >= k`), and `current_window_sum` is updated to `available_days[1]` if `current_window_sum >= k`.***
