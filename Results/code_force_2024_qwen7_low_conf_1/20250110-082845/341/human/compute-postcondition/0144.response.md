The code `ans[j - i + 1] += 1` updates the value of `ans[j - i + 1]` by adding 1 to its current value. Given the initial state, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, so `j - i + 1` will be a non-negative integer. However, since `ans` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans[j - i + 1]` before the operation. But we know that after the operation, `ans[j - i + 1]` will have its value incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `j` is `0`, `s` is `-j`, `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1**
