The code `b[l] = r` updates the value of `b[l]` to be equal to `r`. Based on the initial state, `b[l]` was already equal to `r`. Since the value of `b[l]` is being reassigned to itself, there is no change in the value of `b[l]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nnn` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered; `b[l]` is `r`; `c[r]` is increased by 2; `d[r + 1]` is its original value; `d[l]` is incremented by 2; `l` is the first element of `a[i]`; `r` is the second element of `a[i]`.**
