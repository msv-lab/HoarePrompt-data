Output State: **`m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\); `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is updated such that `ans[i]` is the sum of `ans[j]` for all \(j > i\); `ans[0]` is undefined.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The loop starts with \(i = \max(m, n)\).
   - The loop decrements \(i\) by 1 each time until \(i\) reaches 0.
   - For each iteration, `ans[i]` is updated to include `ans[i + 1]`.

2. **Understanding the Update:**
   - After the first iteration (when \(i = \max(m, n)\)), `ans[\max(m, n)]` becomes `ans[\max(m, n) + 1]`.
   - After the second iteration (when \(i = \max(m, n) - 1\)), `ans[\max(m, n) - 1]` becomes `ans[\max(m, n) - 1] + ans[\max(m, n)]`.
   - This process continues until \(i\) reaches 0.

3. **Final Values of `ans`:**
   - When the loop finishes, `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 will contain the sum of all elements from `ans[j]` for \(j > i\).
   - Specifically, `ans[0]` will be undefined because the loop does not update `ans[0]`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute at least once if \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\).
   - If \(\max(m, n) < 0\), the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains undefined.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - After the loop completes, the array `ans` will have its values updated such that `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 contains the sum of all subsequent elements in `ans`.
   - `ans[0]` will be undefined if the loop executes, and the loop will not execute if \(\max(m, n) < 0\).

Thus, the final output state is:
**`m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\); `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is updated such that `ans[i]` is the sum of `ans[j]` for all \(j > i\); `ans[0]` is undefined.**
