`s` is decremented by 1 if `b[j]` is `False`, otherwise, it remains unchanged. The initial state indicates that `i` is `n + 1`, `j` must be at least `n + 1`, and `s` must be 0. Since `s` is initially 0, decrementing it by 1 would make `s` equal to -1 if `b[j]` is `False`. However, the condition `b[j]` is not specified, so `s` could either remain 0 or become -1.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` must be at least `n + 1`, `s` is either 0 or -1 depending on the value of `b[j]`**
