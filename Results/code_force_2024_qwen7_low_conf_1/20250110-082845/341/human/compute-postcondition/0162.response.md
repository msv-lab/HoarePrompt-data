Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop is defined as: `for i in range(max(m, n), 0, -1):`
- The loop body is omitted.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables Involved:**
   - `i`: This is the loop variable.
   - `m`: This is used as one of the arguments in the `max` function.
   - `n`: This is the other argument used in the `max` function.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will iterate from `max(m, n)` down to `0` in steps of `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute at all, `max(m, n)` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Initial State:**
   - We are given no initial values for `m` and `n`.
   - We need to ensure that `max(m, n) >= 0` for the loop to start.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since we don't have specific values for `m` and `n`, we need to ensure that their combination (through the `max` function) meets the condition for the loop to execute.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `m` and `n` should be such that `max(m, n) >= 0`.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the maximum value between `m` and `n` is non-negative. 

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` and `n` must be such that max(m, n) >= 0**
