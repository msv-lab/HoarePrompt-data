The code `ans[i] += ans[i + 1]` attempts to increment the value of `ans[i]` by the value of `ans[i + 1]`. However, the variable `ans` is not defined in the provided initial state, and there are no further definitions or assignments to `ans` in the given code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific values of `ans[i]` and `ans[i + 1]`.

Given the precondition that `max(m, n) > 1`, this information remains unchanged and is still valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`max(m, n) > 1`, `ans` is undefined**
