The code initializes a new list `available_days` with zeros, where the length of this list is `max_day + 1`. Since `max_day` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact length of the `available_days` list. However, we know that `max_day` should be within the range of the indices of `availability`, which ranges from 1 to 200000.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples
- `availability` is a list of integers where each index represents a day and its value indicates the net number of lecturers available on that day, with the range of indices from 1 to 200000
- `current_available` is 0

The code does not modify the values of `n`, `lecturers`, `availability`, or `current_available`. It only initializes `available_days` to a list of zeros with a length determined by `max_day + 1`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the `available_days` list being initialized.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples, `availability` is a list of integers where each index represents a day and its value indicates the net number of lecturers available on that day, with the range of indices from 1 to 200000, `current_available` is 0, `available_days` is a list of zeros with length `max_day + 1**.
