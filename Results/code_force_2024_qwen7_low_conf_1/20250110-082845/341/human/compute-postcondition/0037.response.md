`current_window_sum` is updated by adding the value of `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]`. The value of `available_days` remains unchanged, `start` is now `start + 1`, and `k` remains unchanged. The value of `count` may or may not be incremented, but since no specific condition for incrementing `count` is given, we assume it may remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `current_window_sum` is updated by adding `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]`; `available_days` remains unchanged; `start` is now `start + 1`; `k` remains unchanged; and `count` may or may not be incremented.

Output State: **`current_window_sum` is updated by adding `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]`; `available_days` remains unchanged; `start` is now `start + 1`; `k` remains unchanged; and `count` may or may not be incremented.**
