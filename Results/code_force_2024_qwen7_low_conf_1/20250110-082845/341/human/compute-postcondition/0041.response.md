`current_window_sum` is updated by adding the value of `available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]` to its current value. The `start` variable is incremented by 1, but its original value before incrementing is `start + 1`. The `count` variable is incremented if the updated `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`available_days` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `start` is now `start + 2`, `current_window_sum` is updated, `count` is incremented if `current_window_sum` >= `k`**
