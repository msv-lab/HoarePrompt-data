To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the changes it makes to the variables.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. For each iteration, it updates several variables based on the values in the list `a`.

#### Key Operations in Each Iteration:
- `l, r = a[i]`: Extracts the left and right bounds from the list `a`.
- `b[l] = r`: Sets the value of `b` at index `l` to `r`.
- `c[r] += 1`: Increments the count of `r` in the array `c`.
- `d[l] += 1`: Increments the count of `l` in the array `d`.
- `d[r + 1] -= 1`: Decrements the count of `r + 1` in the array `d`.

### Understanding the Variables

- **`nnn`**: Remains 0 throughout the loop since it is not updated inside the loop.
- **`i`**: Starts at the maximum value of `r` encountered plus 1 and increments by 1 for each iteration. After all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- **`m`**: Tracks the maximum value of `r` encountered. This value remains unchanged after the loop finishes.
- **`pq`**: A heap queue containing elements greater than or equal to `i` initially. It gets updated with new values as the loop progresses but eventually becomes empty if no further elements are pushed.
- **`b`**: Array where `b[l]` is set to `r` for each pair `(l, r)` processed.
- **`c`**: Array where `c[r]` is incremented by 1 for each `r` processed.
- **`d`**: Array where `d[l]` and `d[r + 1]` are adjusted accordingly.

### Final Values

After the loop completes all iterations:
- `i` will be `n + 1` because it starts at the maximum value of `r` plus 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n + 1`.
- `m` will be the maximum value of `r` encountered.
- `pq` will be empty because the loop processes all elements and pushes them into `pq` and then removes them.
- `b[l]` will be set to `r` for each `(l, r)` pair in `a`.
- `c[r]` will hold the count of how many times `r` appears as the second element in pairs `(l, r)`.
- `d[l]` will be incremented by 1 for each `l` and decremented by 1 for each `r + 1` as described.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `pq` is an empty heap queue, `b[l]` is set to `r` for each `(l, r)` pair in `a`, `c[r]` is the count of occurrences of `r` as the second element in pairs `(l, r)`, `d[l]` is incremented by 1 for each `l` and `d[r + 1]` is decremented by 1 for each `r + 1`.**
