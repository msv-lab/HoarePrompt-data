Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `m`
- `j` is `0`
- `s` is `-j`
- `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1 since `j <= m` is true

### Loop Details
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(m, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = m` to `i = 1` (inclusive) in decrementing order (`-1`).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m`, `j` is `0`, `s` is `-j`, and `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1 because `j <= m` is true.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than `0`.
   - Since `i` was `m` in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `m - 1`.

### Adjusting the States
- **`i`**: It will decrease by 1, so `i` will be `m - 1`.
- **`j`**: The value of `j` remains unchanged at `0`.
- **`s`**: It remains `-j`, which is still `0` because `j` is `0`.
- **`ans[j - i + 1]`**: We need to determine the new index for this array. The current index is `j - i + 1`. For `i = m`, the index is `0 - m + 1 = 1 - m`. In the next iteration, `i` becomes `m - 1`, so the new index will be `0 - (m - 1) + 1 = 2 - m`.

### Final State
Since the condition `j <= m` must still hold true for the loop to continue, and `j` is `0`, the condition `0 <= m` is already satisfied. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `m > 0`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are:
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `j` is `0`
- `s` is `0`
- `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1 since `j <= m` is still true.

State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `j` is `0`, `s` is `0`, `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1 since `j <= m` is true.**
