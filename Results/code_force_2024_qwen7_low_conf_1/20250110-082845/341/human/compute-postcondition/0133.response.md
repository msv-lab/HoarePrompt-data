Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `i` is `m`
   - `j` is `m`
   - `s` is `c[m]` if `b[m]` is `True` and `-1 + c[m]` if `b[m]` is `False`
   - `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by 1 if `j <= m`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `j >= i` and `s < j - i + 1`.

3. **Analyzing the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be greater than or equal to `i` (which is true since both `i` and `j` are `m`).
   - Additionally, `s` must be less than `j - i + 1`. Since `j` and `i` are both `m`, this condition simplifies to `s < 1` because `j - i + 1 = m - m + 1 = 1`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `s` is either `c[m]` (if `b[m]` is `True`) or `-1 + c[m]` (if `b[m]` is `False`).

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - To satisfy `s < 1`, we need `s` to be less than 1.
   - If `b[m]` is `True`, then `s = c[m]`, and `c[m]` must be less than 1.
   - If `b[m]` is `False`, then `s = -1 + c[m]`, and `-1 + c[m]` must be less than 1, which means `c[m]` must be less than 2.

Given these conditions, the only way to ensure the loop executes at least once is to make sure `s` is less than 1. Therefore, `c[m]` must be less than 1 when `b[m]` is `True`, and any value of `c[m]` less than 2 when `b[m]` is `False`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `m`, `j` is `m`, `s` is `c[m]` if `b[m]` is `True` and `-1 + c[m]` if `b[m]` is `False`, and `c[m]` must be less than 1**
