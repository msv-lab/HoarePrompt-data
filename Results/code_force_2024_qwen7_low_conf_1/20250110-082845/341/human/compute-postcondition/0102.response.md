The code `l, r = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i][0]` to `l` and the value of `a[i][1]` to `r`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `nnn` remains unchanged and is still 0.
- `i` remains unchanged and is `i + 1`.
- `m` remains unchanged and is the maximum value of `r` encountered.
- `pq` remains unchanged and is a heap queue containing elements greater than or equal to `i` and is empty if no elements were pushed.
- `b[l] = r` updates the value of `b[l]` to `r`.
- `c[r]` is increased by 1.
- `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.
- `d[l]` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `b[l]` is now `r`.
- `c[r]` is increased by 1.
- `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1.
- `d[l]` is incremented by 1.

The Output State is:
**`nnn` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `b[l]` is `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 1, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1.**
