Postcondition: ***`start` is 4, `current_window_sum` is its initial value plus (available_days[5] - available_days[3]). If `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `current_window_sum`, and `count` remain as per the initial condition and `result[3]` is yet to be calculated.***
