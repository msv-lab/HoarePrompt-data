Postcondition: ***`current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1:k + 1]` plus `available_days[k + 1]` minus `available_days[1]`. If `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 0. `start` is 2, `result[2]` is yet to be calculated, and `available_days` and `k` remain unchanged.***
