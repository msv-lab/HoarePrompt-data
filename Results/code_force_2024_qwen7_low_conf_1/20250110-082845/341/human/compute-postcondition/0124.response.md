To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the current state.

### Given Conditions:
1. `i` is `n + 1`.
2. `j` is at least `n + 1`.
3. `s` is 0 if it was 1, or -1 if it was 0 (decreased by 1).

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as:
- `j >= i`
- `s < j - i + 1`

### Current State Analysis:
1. **`i = n + 1`**: This means `i` is fixed at `n + 1`.
2. **`j >= n + 1`**: This implies `j` is at least `n + 1`.
3. **`s`**: The value of `s` can be either 0 or -1, depending on its previous value.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check the first condition (`j >= i`)**:
   - Since `i = n + 1`, for the loop to continue, `j` must remain `n + 1` or greater.
   - This condition is already satisfied based on the current state.

2. **Check the second condition (`s < j - i + 1`)**:
   - Substituting `i = n + 1`, the condition becomes `s < j - (n + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `s < j - n`.

3. **Determine the required state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must satisfy `s < j - n`.
   - Since `j` is at least `n + 1`, the minimum value of `j - n` is 1.
   - Therefore, `s` must be 0 (since if `s` were -1, it would not satisfy `s < 1`).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be 0 and `j` must remain `n + 1` or greater.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` must be at least `n + 1`, and `s` must be 0**.
