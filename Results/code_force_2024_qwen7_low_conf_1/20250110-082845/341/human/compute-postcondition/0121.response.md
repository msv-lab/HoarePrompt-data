To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. **Initial Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as two conditions are met:
   - \( j \geq i \)
   - \( s < j - i + 1 \)

2. **Current States**:
   - \( i = n + 1 \)
   - \( j \) is at least \( n \), so \( j \geq n \)
   - \( s \) is either 0 or 1

3. **Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must hold true.

Given the current values:
- \( i = n + 1 \)
- Since \( j \geq n \) and \( i = n + 1 \), it follows that \( j > i \). Therefore, \( j \geq i \) is already satisfied.
- \( s \) is either 0 or 1, and we need \( s < j - i + 1 \).

For the loop to continue, \( s \) must be less than \( j - i + 1 \). Given \( i = n + 1 \):
\[ j - i + 1 = j - (n + 1) + 1 = j - n \]

Since \( j \geq n \), the smallest possible value for \( j - n \) is 0 (when \( j = n \)). Therefore:
\[ j - n \geq 0 \]
- If \( s = 0 \), then \( s < j - n \) is always true because 0 is less than any non-negative integer.
- If \( s = 1 \), then \( s < j - n \) is only true if \( j - n > 1 \), which simplifies to \( j > n + 1 \).

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- \( s \) must be 0 or \( s \) must be 1 and \( j \) must be greater than \( n + 1 \).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- \( s \) must be 0 or 1 and \( j \) must be greater than \( n + 1 \).

The modified state is:
**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least `n + 2`, `s` is 0 or 1**
