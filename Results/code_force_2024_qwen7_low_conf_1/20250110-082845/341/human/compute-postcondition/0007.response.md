The code `availability[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `availability[r + 1]` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `lecturers`. Therefore, `availability[r + 1]` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `lecturers` is a non-empty list of tuples with at least two tuples, `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `lecturers`, `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `lecturers`, `availability[r + 1]` is decreased by 1**
