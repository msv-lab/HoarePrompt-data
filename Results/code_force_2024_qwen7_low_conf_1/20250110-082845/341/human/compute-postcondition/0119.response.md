`s` is decremented by 1 if `b[j]` is `False`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The initial state is such that `i` is `n + 1` (at least 2), `j` must be at least `i` (at least 2), and `s` must be less than 2. Since `s` is less than 2, it can only be 0 or 1. If `b[j]` is `False`, `s` will be decremented by 1, making it either -1 or 0. If `b[j]` is `True`, `s` remains unchanged, so it stays at 0 or 1. However, since `s` was initially less than 2, it cannot be -1 in this context.

Therefore, the possible states for `s` are 0 or 1, depending on the value of `b[j]`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1` (at least 2); `j` must be at least `i` (at least 2); `s` is 0 or 1**
