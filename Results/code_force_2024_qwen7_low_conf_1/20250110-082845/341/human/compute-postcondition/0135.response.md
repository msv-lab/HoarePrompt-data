`j` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` remains `m`, and the value of `s` is determined based on the condition of `b[m]`. Since the condition of `b[m]` is not specified in the code, we keep it as it is. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `m`, `j` is `m - 1`, `s` is `c[m] - 1` if `b[m]` is `True` and `-2 + c[m]` if `b[m]` is `False`.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `j` is `m - 1`, `s` is `c[m] - 1` if `b[m]` is `True` and `-2 + c[m]` if `b[m]` is `False`**
