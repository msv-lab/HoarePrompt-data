The code `c[r] += 1` increments the value of `c[r]` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `c[r]` was previously increased by 1. Therefore, `c[r]` will now be increased by 2. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`nnn` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is the maximum value of `r` encountered, `b[l]` is `r`, `c[r]` is increased by 2, `d[r + 1]` is decreased by 1, `d[l]` is incremented by 1.**
