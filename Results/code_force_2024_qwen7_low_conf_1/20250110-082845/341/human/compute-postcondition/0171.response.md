According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nnn`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `nnn + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\).
- `nnn` is a non-negative integer and at least 1.
- `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is already computed.
- `ans[i]` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i` should be less than or equal to `nnn + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be the current value up to `nnn`, so for the loop to continue, `i` must be `nnn + 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `nnn` remains the same since it is the upper bound of the loop.
- `i` will be increased by 1, so it will be `nnn + 1`.

State: **`m` and `n` are integers such that \(\max(m, n) \geq 0\), `nnn` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `ans[i]` for \(i\) from \(\max(m, n)\) to 1 is already computed, and `i` is \(nnn + 1\)**.
