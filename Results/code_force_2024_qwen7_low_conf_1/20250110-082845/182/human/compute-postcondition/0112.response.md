Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `b_count[0]` is one less than its initial value.***

Explanation: The overall postcondition combines both the if and else parts. Since `b_count[0]` is reduced by one in the if part and remains unchanged in the else part, the final state of `b_count[0]` is one less than its initial value. All other variables (`total`, `i`, and `n`) retain their states as described in the precondition.
