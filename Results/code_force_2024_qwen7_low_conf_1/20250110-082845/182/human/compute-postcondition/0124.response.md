`b_count[1]` is decremented by 1. The value of `i_end` is unknown, but `i` is `i_end + 2`. The value of `n` is greater than 0, and `length` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` is greater than 0; `length` is 1; `b_count[1]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` is greater than 0; `length` is 1; `b_count[1]` is decreased by 1.**
