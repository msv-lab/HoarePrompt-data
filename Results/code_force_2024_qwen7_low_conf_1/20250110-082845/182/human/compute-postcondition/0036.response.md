The code prints the value of `k`. The value of `k` is determined by the number of elements returned by `I()` for which `x == value_I + '*'`. However, the actual values of `k` and the elements returned by `I()` are not provided. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `k`, which is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `k` is printed, `a` is `value_I + '*'`.**
