Output State: **`length` is the maximum count of consecutive '0's in `a` up to index `n-1` where the corresponding bit in `b` is '1', `n` is the integer from input, `m` is the integer from input, `a` is the string from input, `b` is the string from input, `b_count` is `[b.count('0') - length_of_0s, b.count('1') - length_of_1s]`, where `length_of_0s` and `length_of_1s` are the counts of '0's and '1's that were used in the loop respectively. `i` is `n` if the loop executes all `n` iterations, otherwise it is the index at which the loop breaks. `n` is the initial value provided, and `length` is printed.**
