The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `total`, `i`, and `n`. It only breaks out of the loop or the innermost enclosing loop or structure. Since there is no loop or structure in the given initial state, the break statement is essentially ignored in this context.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is greater than 0**
