Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer and at least 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is the first input string, `b` is the second input string, `b_count` is a list containing the count of '0's and '1's in `b`, and `length` is 0. If `b_count[0]` is true, the count of '0's in `b_count` is decreased by 1, and `length` is set to 1. If `b_count[1]` is true, `b_count[1]` is reduced by 1 and `length` is 1. Otherwise, `length` remains 0.***
