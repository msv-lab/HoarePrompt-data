The code snippet assigns the value returned by the function `I()` plus a '*' to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) and `k` retains its initial value. However, the exact value of `t` is not relevant to the current code snippet since it does not affect `a`, `k`, or `t`.

After executing the code, `a` is updated to the value returned by `I()` plus a '*'. Since the exact value returned by `I()` is not specified, we denote it as `value_I` for generality.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\); `k` retains its initial value; `a` is `value_I + '*'`**
