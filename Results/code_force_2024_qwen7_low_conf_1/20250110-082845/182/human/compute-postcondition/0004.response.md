`k` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `a` is unchanged and remains as the value returned by `I()` followed by '*', and the value of `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the value returned by `I()` followed by '*', `k` is 0**
