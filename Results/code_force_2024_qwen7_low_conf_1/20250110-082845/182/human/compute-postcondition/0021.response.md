To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given:

1. **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) and \(t = (previous \, t) - 1\).
   - `a` is the final value returned by `I()` + '*'.
   - `k` is either `k + 1` or `k` depending on whether `x` equals `a[k]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the values returned by `I()`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it involves checking if `x` equals `a[k]` and updating `k` accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `t`:**
   - `t` is derived from the previous value of `t` by subtracting 1. This means `t` decreases by 1 with each iteration.

2. **Understanding `a`:**
   - `a` is the result of `I()` plus '*'. The value of `a` remains unchanged within the loop body unless `I()` is called again, which is not indicated here.

3. **Understanding `k`:**
   - `k` is updated based on whether `x` equals `a[k]`. If they are equal, `k` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `k` remains the same.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `I()` provides new values for `x`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `I()` must provide a new value for `x`.

### Adjusted States:

- **`t`**: Since `t` decreases by 1 with each iteration, the next value of `t` will be `t - 1`.
- **`a`**: The value of `a` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` will depend on whether `x` equals `a[k]` in the next iteration. However, since we are only determining the state before entering the loop, we cannot predict the exact value of `k` without knowing `x`. But we know it will be either `k + 1` or `k`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) and \(t = (previous \, t) - 1\), `a` is the final value returned by `I()` + '*', `k` is either `k + 1` or `k`**.

This captures the state before entering the next iteration of the loop.
