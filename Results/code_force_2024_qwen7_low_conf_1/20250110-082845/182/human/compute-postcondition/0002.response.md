The function `I()` is called, which returns a positive integer. However, the specific value returned by `I()` is not given. Therefore, the only change in the state is that `I()` will return a positive integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `I()` returns a positive integer**
