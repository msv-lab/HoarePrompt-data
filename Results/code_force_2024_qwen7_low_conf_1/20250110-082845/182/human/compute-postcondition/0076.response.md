The code `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `b_count`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state is that `length` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`length` is increased by 1, `n` remains the same, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_count` remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 1**
