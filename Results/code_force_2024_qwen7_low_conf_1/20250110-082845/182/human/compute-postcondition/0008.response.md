The code `k += x == a[k]` updates the value of `k` by adding 1 if `x == a[k]` is true, otherwise it remains unchanged. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `t`, `a`, `x`, and `k`, we'll keep them in their general form.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the value returned by `I()`, followed by '*'.
- `k` is incremented by 1 if `x == a[k]`.

After executing the code `k += x == a[k]`:

- If `x == a[k]` is true, then `k` is incremented by 1.
- If `x == a[k]` is false, then `k` remains unchanged.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the value returned by `I()`, followed by '*', `k` is incremented by 1 if `x == a[k]`.**
