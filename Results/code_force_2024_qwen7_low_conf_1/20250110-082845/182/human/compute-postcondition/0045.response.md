The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from user input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. Since the initial value of `length` is printed, it remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are assigned based on the input, but since no specific input is given, we cannot determine their exact values.

Output State: **`length` is its original value, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input**
