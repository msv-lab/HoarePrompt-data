The code `I = input` assigns the function `input` to the variable `I`. This does not change the values of any variables but affects how inputs are handled in the future. The precondition remains the same for the other variables.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, I now refers to the input function, for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m respectively are provided. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
