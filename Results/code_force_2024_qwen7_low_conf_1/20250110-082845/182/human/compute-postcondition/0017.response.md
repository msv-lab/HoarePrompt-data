Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) and \(t = (previous \, t) - 1\).
   - `a` is the final value returned by `I()` + '*'.
   - `k` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the values returned by the function `I()`.
   - For the loop to execute, `I()` must return at least one value.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The variable `t` does not directly affect whether the loop will execute. It only needs to satisfy its initial condition.
   - The variable `a` is not directly related to the loop's execution either; it might be used inside the loop but not necessary for the loop itself to run.
   - The variable `k` is set to 0 initially and is not relevant to the loop execution.
   - The critical factor is ensuring that `I()` returns at least one value so that the loop can iterate.

Given these points, the key state to adjust is ensuring that `I()` returns at least one value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) and \(t = (previous \, t) - 1\), `a` is the final value returned by `I()` + '*', `k` is 0, and `I()` must return at least one value**.
