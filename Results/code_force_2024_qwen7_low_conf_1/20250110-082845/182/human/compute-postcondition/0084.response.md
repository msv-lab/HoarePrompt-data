Postcondition: ***`length` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_count` remains unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` equals '0', then `b_count[0]` is decreased by 1 if it is true. Otherwise, `i` is set to 2. If `a[i]` does not equal '0', then `b_count[1]` is decreased by 1 if it is true. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
