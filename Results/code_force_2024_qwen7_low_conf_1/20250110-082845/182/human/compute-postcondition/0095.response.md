`length` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` being greater than 0 and the current value of `a[i]` being '0' and `b_count[0]` being true remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `a[i]` is '0', `b_count[0]` is true, `length` is 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `a[i]` is '0', `b_count[0]` is true, `length` is 1**
