The code `k += x == a[k]` checks if `x` is equal to `a[k]` and adds the result (either 0 or 1) to `k`. However, the values of `a` and `x` are not provided, and only `t` and `k` have initial values. Let's analyze the impact:

- `t` is updated to `t - 1`.
- `a` is defined as the final value returned by `I()` plus `'*'`.
- `k` is updated based on whether `x` is equal to `a[k]`.

Since `a` and `x` are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values. We know `k` will be incremented by either 0 or 1 based on the condition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) and \(t = (previous \, t) - 1\), `a` is the final value returned by `I()` + '*', `k` is either `k + 1` or `k` depending on whether `x` equals `a[k]`.**
