Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial state:**
   - The loop iterates over values returned by the function `I()`.
   - The loop variable `x` is initialized to the value returned by `I()`.

2. **Initial states given:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is the value returned by `I()` followed by '*'.
   - `k` is 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the function `I()` must return a value.
   - The loop will continue as long as `I()` returns a value until it returns a value that ends the loop (typically an empty value or a specific condition).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - Since `x` is initialized to the value returned by `I()`, `I()` must return a value for the loop to start.
   - `a` is already set to the value returned by `I()` followed by '*', so this state does not need to be changed.
   - `k` being 0 is fine since the loop's behavior does not depend on `k` directly.

5. **Final states needed for the loop to execute:**
   - `t` is within the specified range (\(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)).
   - `a` is set to the value returned by `I()` followed by '*'.
   - `I()` must return a value for the loop to start.

Thus, the final state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the value returned by `I()` followed by '*', and `I()` must return a value**.
