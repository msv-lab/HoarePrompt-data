The code snippet `a = I() + '*'` affects the variable `a`. The function `I()` returns a value `a`, and this value is concatenated with the string `'*'`. Since the exact return value of `I()` is not specified, we represent it as `a` itself.

The initial state gives us that `a` is the final value returned by `I()`. After the code executes, `a` will be the return value of `I()` concatenated with `'*'`.

The other variables, `t` and `k`, remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) and \(t = (previous \, t) - 1\); `a` is the final value returned by `I()` + '*', `k` is either 0 or the count of times `x == a[k]` was true during the loop's execution.**
