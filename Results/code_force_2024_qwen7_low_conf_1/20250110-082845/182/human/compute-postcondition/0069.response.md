Postcondition: ***`length` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration. `n` remains the same. `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `b_count` also remains unchanged. If `b_count[0]` is true, `length` is incremented by 1 and `b_count[0]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***
