`a` is assigned the value of `I()` plus the string `'*'`. The function `I()` returns a positive integer, and the value of `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `I()` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not known.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `a` is the value returned by `I()` followed by '*'**
