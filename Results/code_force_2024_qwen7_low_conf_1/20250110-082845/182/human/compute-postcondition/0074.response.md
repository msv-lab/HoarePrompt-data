Postcondition: ***`length` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration. `n` remains the same. `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `b_count` also remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is '0' and `b_count[0]` is true, `length` is incremented by 1 and `b_count[0]` is decreased by 1. If `a[i]` is '0' and `b_count[1]` is true, `length` is incremented by 1 and `b_count[1]` is decreased by 1. If `a[i]` is not '0', no changes are made to `length`, `b_count`, or other variables.***
