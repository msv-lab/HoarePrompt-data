`b_count[1]` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `b_count[1]` is not specified, but since it is decremented by 1, its new value will be the initial value minus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `length` is 1, `b_count[1]` is its initial value - 1**
