The code `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. The initial state shows that `total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 2`, and `n` is greater than 0. The variables `total`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` is greater than 0; `length` is 1**
