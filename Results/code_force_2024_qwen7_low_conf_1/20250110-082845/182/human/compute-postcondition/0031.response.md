Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over elements produced by the function `I()`.
   - We need to determine the condition under which the loop continues.

2. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
   - `k` is 1 if `x == value_I + '*', else `k` is 0.
   - `a` is `value_I + '*'`.

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs for each element `x` generated by `I()`.
   - After each iteration, `k` is updated based on the comparison between `x` and `a`.

4. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be 1 because it signifies that the current `x` matches `a`.
   - If `k` is 0, the loop stops.

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `k` determines whether the loop continues, we need to find the next value of `x` from `I()` that makes `k` equal to 1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is either 0 or 1.
     - If `k` is 1, then `x` matched `a` and the loop will stop.
     - If `k` is 0, then `x` did not match `a` and the loop continues.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - If `k` is 0 (the loop continues), the next value of `x` from `I()` will be compared with `a`.
   - Therefore, `t` remains the same since it does not affect the loop continuation.
   - `k` will be updated to 1 if the next `x` matches `a`, or it will remain 0 if it does not.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is the fixed value.

7. **Final State:**
   - `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) as no changes are made to it.
   - `k` must be 0 for the loop to continue, and will be updated to 1 if the next `x` matches `a`.
   - `a` remains `value_I + '*'`.

Thus, the state to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `k` is 0, `a` is `value_I + '*'`**
