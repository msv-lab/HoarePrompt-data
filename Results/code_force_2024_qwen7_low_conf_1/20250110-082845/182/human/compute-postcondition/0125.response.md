The code `break` does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` is greater than 0**
