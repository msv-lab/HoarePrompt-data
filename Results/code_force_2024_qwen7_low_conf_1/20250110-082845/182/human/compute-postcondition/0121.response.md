The code `break` does not assign any new values to the variables but breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. Since no new assignments are made, the values of `total`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` is greater than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
