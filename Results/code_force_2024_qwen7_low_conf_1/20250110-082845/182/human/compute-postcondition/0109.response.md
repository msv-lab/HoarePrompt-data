`length` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is `i_end + 1`, so it does not affect the value of `length`. The values of `total` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `length` is 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `length` is 1**
