The code `k = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `k`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `k` is now `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) and \(t = (previous \, t) - 1\); `a` is the final value returned by `I()` + '*', `k` is 0**
