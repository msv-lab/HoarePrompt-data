Postcondition: **`length` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, and `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1') - 1]` if `b_count[1]` is true and `b_count[0]` was initially non-zero. Otherwise, `b_count` remains unchanged and `length` is 0.**
