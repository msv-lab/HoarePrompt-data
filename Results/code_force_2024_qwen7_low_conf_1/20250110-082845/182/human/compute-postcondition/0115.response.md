The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `total`, `i`, and `n`. It only breaks out of the current loop or the innermost enclosing loop or the most internal if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the initial state, the `break` statement here does not change any variable values but indicates that a loop or if statement would be exited.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is greater than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
