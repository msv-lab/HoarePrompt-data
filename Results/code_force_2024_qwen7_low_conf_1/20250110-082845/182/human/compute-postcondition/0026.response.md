The function `I()` is called without any arguments, and its final value is assigned to `a`. The value of `a` is followed by '*', indicating that `a` is a string. The value of `k` is determined by counting how many times `x` equals `a[k]` during the loop execution, and then adding 1. However, since there is no loop or comparison in the provided code snippet, `k` remains unchanged from its initial state.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) and \(t = (previous \, t) - 1\)
- `a` is the final value returned by `I()` + '*'
- `k` is the number of times `x` equals `a[k]` during the loop execution plus 1 if the condition holds, and the value of `k` is printed

Since the code does not change the value of `k` or execute a loop, `k` retains its initial value. The only changes are that `t` is updated according to its definition and `a` is set to the return value of `I()` followed by '*'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\) and \(t = (previous \, t) - 1\); `a` is the final value returned by `I()` + '*'; `k` retains its initial value**
