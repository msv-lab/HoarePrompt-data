`length` is assigned the value of `length + 1`. The initial value of `length` is not explicitly given, but since no value was initially assigned to it in the provided state, we assume it to be 0. Therefore, after executing `length += 1`, the value of `length` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `length` is 1**
