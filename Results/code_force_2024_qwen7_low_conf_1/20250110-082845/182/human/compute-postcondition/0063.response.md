Postcondition: ***`length` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1') - 1]` if `b_count[1]` is true. Otherwise, `length` is 0, `n` is an integer from input and must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')]` and we break out of the most internal loop or match-case.***
