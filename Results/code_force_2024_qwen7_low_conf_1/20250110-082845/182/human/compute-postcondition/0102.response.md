`length` is incremented by 1. The value of `total` remains 0, `n` is still greater than 0, `a[i]` is not '0', and `b_count[1]` is true. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is not '0', `b_count[1]` is true; `length` is 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is not '0', `b_count[1]` is true; `length` is 1**
