`length` is assigned the value of itself plus 1, which means it is incremented by 1. The other variables (`total`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `length` is 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `length` is 1**
