The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`, an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case `i` (where \(1 \leq i \leq t\)), the function receives:
  - `n` and `m`, both integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - Two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively.

The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b`.

Since the problem description does not specify the exact return value, we can only describe the input parameters and their constraints.
