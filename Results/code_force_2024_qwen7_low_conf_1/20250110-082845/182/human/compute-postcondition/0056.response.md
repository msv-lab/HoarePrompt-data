Postcondition: ***`length` is 0, `n` is an integer from input and must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a string from input, `b` is a string from input, `b_count` is `[b.count('0'), b.count('1')]`. If `b_count[0]` is initially non-zero, then `b_count[0]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `b_count` remains unchanged and `length` remains 0.***
