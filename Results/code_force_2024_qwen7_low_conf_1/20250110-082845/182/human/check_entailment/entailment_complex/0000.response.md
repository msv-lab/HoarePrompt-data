Reasoning:
1. The function processes each test case correctly by reading the necessary inputs and calculating the required value of `k`.
2. The function uses a simple loop to iterate through the characters of string `b` and checks if they match the corresponding characters in string `a` (concatenated with a '*').
3. The function ensures that the sum of all \( n \) values and the sum of all \( m \) values do not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).
4. The function handles edge cases such as empty strings and the limit of 10,000 test cases appropriately.
5. The function logic matches the problem description accurately.

Given these points, the function appears to be correct according to the provided problem description and the execution states.

Correctness: **True**
