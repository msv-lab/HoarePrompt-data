Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum prefix length \( k \) of string \( a \) that forms a subsequence of string \( b \).
2. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths \( n \) and \( m \) of strings \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - It then reads the strings \( a \) and \( b \).
   - The function uses an additional character `'*'` appended to string \( a \) to handle the end of the string \( a \) properly.
   - In the loop, it checks if the current character of \( b \) matches the current character of \( a \). If it matches, it increments \( k \).
   - This approach ensures that we are checking the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles empty strings \( a \) and \( b \) correctly by processing them within the given logic.
   - The function also handles the case where the length of \( a \) is less than the length of \( b \) and vice versa.
   - The function is limited to processing up to 10,000 test cases, which is within the problem constraints.
4. **Output**: The function correctly outputs the maximum value of \( k \) for each test case.

Based on the above analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length of string \( a \) that forms a subsequence of string \( b \).

Correctness: **True**
