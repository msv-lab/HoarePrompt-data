You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100

    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

# Program:
def func():
    I = input
    for _ in [0] * int(I()):
        I()
        a = I() + '*'
        k = 0
        for x in I():
            k += x == a[k]
        print(k)





# Execution Summary:
The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) of lengths \( n \) and \( m \) respectively. It then calculates the maximum value of the count of times \( x == a[k] \) was true during any iteration of the loop, where \( x \) is a character from the string \( b \) and \( k \) is the index in the string \( a \) concatenated with a '*' character. Finally, it prints the maximum value for each test case. The function ensures that the sum of all \( n \) values and the sum of all \( m \) values do not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If the input strings \( a \) or \( b \) are empty, the function still processes them correctly.
2. If the length of \( a \) is less than the length of \( b \), the function still correctly calculates the maximum value.
3. If the input \( t \) exceeds 10,000, the function only processes up to 10,000 test cases.
