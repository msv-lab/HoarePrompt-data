#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and two binary strings a and b of lengths n and m respectively are provided. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    I = input
    for _ in [0] * int(I()):
        I()
        
        a = I() + '*'
        
        k = 0
        
        for x in I():
            k += x == a[k]
        
        print(k)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the value returned by `I()` concatenated with '*', `k` is the maximum value of the count of times `x == a[k]` was true during any iteration of the loop, and the value of `k` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) of lengths \( n \) and \( m \) respectively. It then calculates the maximum value of the count of times \( x == a[k] \) was true during any iteration of the loop, where \( x \) is a character from the string \( b \) and \( k \) is the index in the string \( a \) concatenated with a '*' character. Finally, it prints the maximum value for each test case. The function ensures that the sum of all \( n \) values and the sum of all \( m \) values do not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If the input strings \( a \) or \( b \) are empty, the function still processes them correctly.
2. If the length of \( a \) is less than the length of \( b \), the function still correctly calculates the maximum value.
3. If the input \( t \) exceeds 10,000, the function only processes up to 10,000 test cases.
