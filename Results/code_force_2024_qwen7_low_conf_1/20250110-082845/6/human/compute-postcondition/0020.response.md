The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`. The parameter `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). Each test case within `t` consists of two integers `n` and `k` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\).

Case_1: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and for each test case, if `k` is within the valid range for given `n`, the function returns a boolean indicating whether `k` can represent a unique combination of two elements from a set of `n` elements. If `k` is out of range, the function returns an error message.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `t` and validate each test case consisting of `n` and `k`, returning whether `k` represents a valid combination or an error message if `k` is out of range.
