The code snippet `print(r)` simply prints the value of the variable `r`. The value of `r` is determined by the condition in the initial state: `r` is equal to 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise `r` remains unchanged (still equal to `n`). Printing `r` does not change its value.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `r` being either 1 if `k` ≥ `n - 1` or `n` otherwise.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is equal to 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise `r` remains unchanged (still equal to `n`). The value of `r` is printed.**
