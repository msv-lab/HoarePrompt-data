The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to handle multiple test cases internally, where for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\). The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes test cases where `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges and returns a value based on these inputs.**
