Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `r` is always 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.** 

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times based on the input value of `t`.
- For each iteration, the values of `n` and `k` are taken as inputs.
- The variable `r` is initially set to `n`.
- The condition `if k >= n - 1` checks whether `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
- If the condition is true, `r` is set to 1.
- If the condition is false, `r` remains `n`.

Since the loop runs for each `t` from 1 to the maximum possible value (10^3), after all iterations are completed, the value of `r` will be 1 because the condition `k >= n - 1` will eventually be true for any `n` greater than 1 (since `k` can go up to \((n * (n - 1)) / 2\)), making `r` equal to 1 in all cases where the loop runs. If `t` is 0, the loop will not run at all, and the values of `n` and `k` will still be the last inputs provided, but `r` will be 1.

Thus, regardless of the values of `n` and `k` during each iteration, the final value of `r` will be 1 after all iterations are complete.
