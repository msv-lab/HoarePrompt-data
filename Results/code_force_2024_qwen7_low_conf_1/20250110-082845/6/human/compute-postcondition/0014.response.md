The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means the previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was assigned before and no new assignment to `t` is made in this code snippet. The value of `r` is determined by the condition `k >= n - 1` before the code snippet, so its value does not change unless the condition itself changes, which is not the case here.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `r` is set to 1 if the condition `k >= n - 1` is true, otherwise `r` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
