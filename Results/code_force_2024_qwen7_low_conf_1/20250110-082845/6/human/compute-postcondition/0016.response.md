The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
