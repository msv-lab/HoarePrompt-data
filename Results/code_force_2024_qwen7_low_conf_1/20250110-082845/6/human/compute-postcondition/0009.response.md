The code `r = n` assigns the value of `n` to `r`. This changes the value of `r` but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. The condition for `r` being equal to 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` remains unchanged because `r` is now simply equal to `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is equal to `n`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is equal to `n`**
