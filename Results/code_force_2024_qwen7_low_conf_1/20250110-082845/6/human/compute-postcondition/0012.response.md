The code `print(r)` simply prints the value of `r`. The value of `r` was determined before this line of code was executed based on the condition `k >= n - 1`. The print statement does not change the value of `r` or any other variables. Therefore, the value of `r` remains the same after executing the print statement.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is set to 1 if the condition `k >= n - 1` is true, otherwise `r` is `n`. The value of `r` is printed.**
