The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers separated by a space from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged. 

Since the initial state of `t` is specified as a positive integer between 1 and \(10^3\), and the code does not affect `t`, the value of `t` remains within this range.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
