The code `print(r)` simply prints the value of `r`. The value of `r` is 1, and it does not get updated or affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
