The initial state is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is equal to `n`.

The code snippet is:
```python
r = 1
```

This line of code sets the variable `r` to 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is 1.**
