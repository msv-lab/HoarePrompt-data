The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial value of `r` depends on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Since the code does not modify `r`, the value of `r` remains as it was initially defined based on the condition. However, the code does not explicitly print `r`, so the output state only reflects the changes in `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is equal to 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise `r` remains unchanged (still equal to `n`).**
