Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` as input. It calculates `c` as `a * (a - 1) // 2`, which represents the number of edges in a complete graph with `a` vertices. If for each test case, the condition `c - b >= a - 1` is satisfied, it prints the value of `a`; otherwise, it prints `1` for that test case. The function iterates over `n` test cases and prints the result for each one.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input values for `a` and `b` are valid and within the specified ranges. However, there is no validation to check if `a` and `b` are indeed within the ranges `1 ≤ a ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ b ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2`.
- After the for loop, the function state shows that `n` is set to `0`, indicating that `n` is being reset to `0` at the end of the function. This is not mentioned in the annotations and might be unintended. If the intention was to keep the final value of `n`, this should be clarified.
- The annotations suggest that the program state includes the last valid `a` value if the condition is satisfied for all iterations. However, the actual code prints `1` for each iteration where the condition fails, regardless of whether the condition was satisfied for previous iterations. This behavior is not explicitly stated in the annotations.
