`r` is initially set to the value of `n`. The given code snippet sets `r` to 1, which overrides the previous value of `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `r` is equal to 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is equal to 1**
