The function `func` accepts a positive integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). For each test case within `t`, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\). It then determines whether `k` can represent a unique combination of two elements from a set of `n` elements. If `k` is within the valid range for the given `n`, it prints the value of `n` (which is always 1 in this case). If `k` is out of range, it prints 1. There is no explicit error message for out-of-range `k`; instead, it simply prints 1 for such cases. The function does not return anything explicitly but modifies the print statements based on the conditions checked.
