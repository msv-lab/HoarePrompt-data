Reasoning:
- The program reads a series of test cases and for each test case, it aims to calculate the maximum final score achievable.
- The approach taken in the function `func()` is to iteratively remove pairs of the smallest elements from the list and accumulate their minimum values into a score. This process is repeated until no more pairs can be formed.
- However, the implementation has a few issues:
  - It incorrectly handles the list removal logic inside the loop, which leads to potential out-of-range errors and incorrect results.
  - The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` should be `if len(lst) >= 2:` to ensure that the list still has at least two elements before attempting to remove them.
  - The indices used in `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. These should be simplified to just `lst.remove(lst[0])` and `lst.remove(lst[1])`.
  - The loop should continue until fewer than 2 elements remain, not based on a fixed number of iterations.
  - The logic for handling the last remaining elements is missing, as the loop exits prematurely when the list size drops below 2.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the maximum score as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
