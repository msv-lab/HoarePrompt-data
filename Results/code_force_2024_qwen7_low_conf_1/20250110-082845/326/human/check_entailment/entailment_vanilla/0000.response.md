Reasoning:
- The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the score.
- The core issue lies in how the elements of the list `lst` are being processed and removed.
- The code only processes pairs of the first two elements in the list at a time, instead of always selecting the minimum pair available at each step.
- This leads to suboptimal solutions because it does not consider all possible pairs to ensure the maximum score is achieved.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program incorrectly handles the selection of pairs to maximize the score. It only processes the first two elements repeatedly, which does not guarantee the optimal score. The correct approach would involve always selecting the smallest two numbers from the list to maximize the score at each step. The given solution should be revised to properly handle this logic.
