Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The issue lies in how the program processes the list of integers for each test case.
- Specifically, the program attempts to handle the list `lst` incorrectly by removing elements at specific indices without properly sorting or pairing the elements to maximize the score.
- The goal is to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest pair of numbers available to ensure the highest possible score at each step. However, the current implementation does not ensure this optimal strategy.
- The provided solution fails to sort the list before processing, which means it may not always pick the smallest possible pairs, thus potentially leading to a suboptimal score.

Correctness: **False**

The correct approach would involve sorting the list of numbers and then iteratively picking the two smallest numbers to add their minimum value to the score, ensuring the optimal strategy is followed throughout the process.
