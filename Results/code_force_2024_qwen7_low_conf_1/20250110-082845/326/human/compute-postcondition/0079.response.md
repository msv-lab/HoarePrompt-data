`lst` initially contains `['2']`. The code removes the element at index `1 * 2`, which is the same as the index `2`. Since the list only contains one element (`'2'`), removing the element at index `2` would result in an error if the code were to run as written. However, since the list only has one element, there is no element at index `2` to remove.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state because the code cannot be executed due to an invalid index.

Output State: **`lst` is `['2']`, `ans` is either `5` or `4`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is `[0]`**
