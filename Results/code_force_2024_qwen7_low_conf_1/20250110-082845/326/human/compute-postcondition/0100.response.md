The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly within its definition. Instead, it implies that the function will operate on variables or data structures that are not defined within the function scope but are provided externally (such as through global variables or passed via other means). The function processes a list containing `2n` positive integers, where `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`, and each integer in the list is in the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`. Additionally, there is a variable `t` which is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`.

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, we can infer the following:

- The function processes a list of `2n` integers.
- It also uses the variable `t`.
- Based on the input, the function may return different types of information or values.

Since the exact return values are not specified, we can describe the function's input requirements as follows:

The function `func` does not accept any direct parameters. It operates on a list of `2n` positive integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and each integer in the list is between 1 and \(10^7\). Additionally, it uses a variable `t` which is a positive integer between 1 and 5000. 

Functionality: **The function operates on a list of `2n` positive integers and a variable `t`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 and each integer in the list is between 1 and \(10^7\), and `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000.**
