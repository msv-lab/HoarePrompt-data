`lst` is a list with one element. Initially, the length of `lst` is 1. The condition for updating `ans` is that if the length of `lst` was 2 initially, then `ans` would be equal to its initial value plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. However, since the length of `lst` is 1, this condition does not apply, and `ans` remains unchanged. 

The code snippet `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` attempts to remove the element at index `1 * 2` (which is index 2) from the list `lst`. Since the length of `lst` is 1, the index 2 is out of range, and this operation will raise an `IndexError`.

Given that the code raises an error and no valid changes are made to the variables, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`lst` is a list with one element, `ans` remains unchanged**.
