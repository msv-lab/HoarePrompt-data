The code `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` impacts the `ans` variable by adding to it the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. Since `lst` is a list with a length not equal to 2, we know it still has a length not equal to 2 after the code execution. However, we cannot specify the exact values of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` without additional information.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`lst` is a list with a length not equal to 2, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to its current value.**
