The code removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which simplifies to `0`) from the list `lst`. Given that the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, this removal is valid. The value of `lst[0]` is removed from `lst`. 

Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `lst`, we cannot determine the exact value of the element being removed. However, we know that the length of `lst` decreases by one.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `ans_f` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `ans` is its previous value plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- The length of `lst` is reduced by one.
- All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is its previous value plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, the length of `lst` is reduced by one.**
