The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input taken from the user to the variable `n`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `lst` is a list
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `(n * 2) + 1`
- `n` is now the integer value entered by the user
- `t` is the original input integer (unchanged)
- `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans` (which is 0)

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `ans` is 0, `i` is `(n * 2) + 1, `n` is the integer value entered by the user, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0**
