According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` ranges from 0 to `n * 2 - 1`. The initial state of `i` is 0, which means the loop can potentially execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer. However, we need to ensure that the loop can actually run for the given conditions.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer (no initial value specified, but it must be a non-negative integer for the loop to run).
   - `ans_f` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n * 2 - 1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `n * 2` is a positive number.
   - Therefore, `n` must be a non-negative integer.

Based on this reasoning, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be a non-negative integer.
- `i` is already set to 0.

So, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces**.
