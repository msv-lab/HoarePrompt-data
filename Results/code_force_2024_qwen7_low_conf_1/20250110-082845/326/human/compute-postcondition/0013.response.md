The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. Given that `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces and its length is equal to 2, let's denote the elements of `lst` as `a` and `b`. So, the code essentially does:

```python
ans += min(a, b)
```

Since `lst` contains two integers, the value of `ans` will be updated by the smaller of these two integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces and its length is equal to 2.**
