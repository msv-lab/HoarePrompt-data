`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds an integer input from the user. The other variables (`t`, `ans_f`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing [0], `i` is \( n * 2 + k + 1 \), `ans` is 0**
