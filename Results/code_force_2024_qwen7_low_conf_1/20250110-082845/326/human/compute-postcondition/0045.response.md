Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the third element of `lst` is removed, and `ans` is updated by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to its current value. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is updated by adding the minimum value between the first and second elements of `lst` (converted to integers) to its original value.***
