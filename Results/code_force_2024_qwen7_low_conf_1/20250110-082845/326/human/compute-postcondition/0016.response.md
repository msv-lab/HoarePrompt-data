Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( t \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \).
   - \( n \) is a non-negative integer.
   - \( ans_f \) is an empty list.
   - \( i \) is 0.
   - \( ans \) is defined as follows:
     - If `len(lst)` equals 2, then `ans = min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
     - Otherwise, `lst` has one less element and its third element is removed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n * 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n * 2 - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the last value it reached before the current iteration.

4. **Determine the New Value of `i`:**
   - If the loop just finished, then the previous value of `i` was `n * 2 - 1`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be `n * 2`.

5. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n * 2`.

6. **Adjust Other States:**
   - Since no specific operations are mentioned in the loop body that change `t`, `n`, `ans_f`, or `ans`, these states remain unchanged.

7. **Final State Before the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans_f` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `n * 2`.
   - `ans` remains the same as defined previously.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is \( n * 2 \), `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if `len(lst)` equals 2, otherwise `lst` has one less element and its third element is removed.**
