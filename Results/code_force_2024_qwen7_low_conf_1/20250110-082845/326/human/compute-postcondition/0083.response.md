Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`.
   - `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if `len(lst)` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains 3.
   - `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.
   - `t` is the original input integer.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken if the else part is executed.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop runs from `i = n * 2 + 1` to `i < n * 2 + n`.

3. **Step Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n * 2 + n`.

4. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `n * 2 + 2`.

5. **Other States:**
   - The value of `ans` does not change within the loop based on the given information.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop based on the given information.
   - The value of `ans_f` remains as `[0]` unless modified within the loop.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n * 2 + 2`.
   - All other states remain the same as they did not change during the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if `len(lst)` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains 3, `i` is `n * 2 + 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0**.
