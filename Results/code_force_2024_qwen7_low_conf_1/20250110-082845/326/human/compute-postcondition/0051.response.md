The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `lst` or `ans`. It simply breaks out of the current loop or block of code, but does not change any variable values.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, the length of `lst` is either 2 or 1, `ans` is now equal to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`**
