Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
- `n` is a non-negative integer (its value changes with each iteration)
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sums of the minimum values of the pairs of elements from `lst` for each of the `t` iterations
- `i` is `n * 2`

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in ans_f:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in `ans_f`.
- To execute the loop, `ans_f` must contain at least one element.

### State Adjustment:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `ans_f` contains at least one element. Since the initial state does not specify anything about `ans_f`, we need to set it to have at least one element.

### Final State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
- `n` is a non-negative integer (its value changes with each iteration)
- `ans_f` is a list containing at least one element
- `i` is initially `n * 2` (though this value is dependent on the current value of `n`, we only need to ensure `ans_f` has an element to start the loop)

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is initially `n * 2`**
