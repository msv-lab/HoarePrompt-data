The code reads an input into the variable `l`, which overwrites the value of `lst`. However, since no specific value is provided for `l`, we'll denote the new value of `lst` as the input provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`lst` is the input provided by the user, `ans` is 0, `i` is `(n * 2) + 1, `n` is the integer value entered by the user, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0**
