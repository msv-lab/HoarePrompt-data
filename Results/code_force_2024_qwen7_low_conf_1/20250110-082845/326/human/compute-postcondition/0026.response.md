`lst.remove(lst[2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. The value of `i` is \( n * 2 \), which means `i` is the same as it was before the code execution because the code does not affect `i`. The `ans_f` list remains empty since no elements are added to it. The state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is \( n * 2 \), and the element at index 2 of `lst` is removed.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is \( n * 2 \), and the element at index 2 of `lst` is removed.**
