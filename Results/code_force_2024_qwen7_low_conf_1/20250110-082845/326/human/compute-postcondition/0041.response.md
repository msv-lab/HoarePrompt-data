`lst` is a list with a length not equal to 2, and the first element is removed; `ans` is updated by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to its current value.

The code snippet `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` simplifies to `lst.remove(lst[2])`. This removes the third element from the list `lst` (since list indexing starts at 0). 

Since the initial state specifies that the list's length is not equal to 2 and the first element is removed, we need to consider the list's structure before and after the removal. However, the exact values of the elements in the list are not specified, only their relative positions and the fact that the first element was removed.

After removing the third element (`lst[2]`), the list length is still not equal to 2. The value of `ans` remains unchanged because the code to update `ans` is not executed due to the list modification.

Output State: **`lst` is a list with a length not equal to 2, and the third element is removed; `ans` is updated by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to its current value.**
