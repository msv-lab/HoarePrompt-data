`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` is now a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), and the value of `n` remains unknown. The list mentioned in the precondition is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and the value of `n` is unknown, and the list remains unchanged.**
