The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, `ans_f` remains an empty list, `i` remains 0, and `ans` remains 0. The impact on the program is that `n` now holds an integer input value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0**
