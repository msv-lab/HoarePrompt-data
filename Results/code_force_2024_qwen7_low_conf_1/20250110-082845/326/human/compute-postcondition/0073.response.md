The code snippet `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` impacts the `ans` variable by adding the minimum value between the first and second elements of `lst` (converted to integers) to `ans`. Since `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`, the values of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` are strings representing numbers. Given the initial state where the length of `lst` is 2, both `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` are strings.

Let's denote the original input string `l` such that when split, `lst` is formed. For simplicity, let's assume the original input string `l` was "3,5". Therefore, `lst` would be `['3', '5']`.

1. Convert `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` to integers: `int('3')` and `int('5')`.
2. Find the minimum value between them: `min(3, 5)` which is `3`.
3. Add this minimum value to `ans`: `ans += 3`.

Given the initial state where `ans` is `0`, after executing the code, `ans` will be `3`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`, `ans` is 3, `i` is now `n * 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0, and the length of `lst` is equal to 2**.
