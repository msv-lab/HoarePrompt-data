The code `break` does not affect any variables' values but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code, the only impact is that the program will exit the context it was in (if it was inside a loop or conditional). The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is \( n * 2 \) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
