Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( 2n \) positive integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of elements from the list and stores these sums in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each sum in the list. The function handles up to 5000 test cases, with \( n \) ranging from 1 to 50 and each element in the list ranging from 1 to \( 10^7 \).**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the list length is not exactly \( 2n \), the function currently breaks without handling this case. This could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors. A proper handling would be to check the length of the list and handle cases where it is not \( 2n \).
- The function assumes that the list always contains at least two elements to form a pair, which might not be true if the list is too short. It should handle cases where the list has fewer than \( 2n \) elements by either skipping such inputs or providing appropriate error handling.
- The function does not explicitly validate the input types. While the code casts inputs to integers, it does not check if the inputs are valid numbers or within the specified ranges. Proper validation should be added to ensure the inputs meet the requirements.
- The function does not account for scenarios where the input values exceed the specified range (e.g., integers outside the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 \)). Such values should be validated and handled appropriately to prevent errors or incorrect results.
