Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is \( n * 2 \). If the element at index 2 of `lst` is not removed, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index 2 of `lst` is removed, the program continues executing as normal.***
