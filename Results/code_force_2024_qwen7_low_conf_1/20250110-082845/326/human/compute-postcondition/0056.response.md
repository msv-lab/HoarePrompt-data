The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index `2` (since `1 * 2` equals `2`) from the list `lst`. Given the initial state where `lst` is a list with the first element removed and `ans` is unchanged if the original length was 2, or updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if the original length was greater than 2, let's analyze the impact:

1. The original length of `lst` could be 2 or more. If it was 2, `ans` remains unchanged. If it was greater than 2, `ans` would be updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
2. After removing the element at index `2`, the length of `lst` is reduced by one.
3. The value of `i` is incremented by 1.

Since the exact initial values of `lst` are not specified, we will consider both cases:

- If the original length of `lst` was 2, `ans` remains unchanged.
- If the original length of `lst` was greater than 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.

In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1 and the element at index `2` is removed.

Output State: **`lst` is a list with the element at index 2 removed, `ans` is unchanged if the original length was 2, or updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if the original length was greater than 2, `i` is increased by 1.**
