Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lst` is a list.
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if the length of `lst` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Information:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n * 2)`.

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n * 2 - 1`.
   - Each iteration does not directly modify `lst` or `ans`, but we need to consider how the loop progress affects the condition for updating `ans`.

4. **Conditions for Updating `ans`:**
   - `ans` is updated only if the length of `lst` is exactly 2.
   - Since the loop itself does not change the length of `lst`, the condition for updating `ans` remains the same unless the loop causes `lst` to change its length.

5. **Loop Progression:**
   - At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n * 2 - 1`.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop does not modify `lst` or `ans` directly, the only thing that changes is the value of `i`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the information, we don't have a specific value for `i` or `n` at the end of the previous iteration, but we know that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n * 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `ans` remains unchanged as long as the length of `lst` is not 2.

Since the exact values of `i` and `n` were not given, we can represent the state as follows:

**State: **`lst` is a list, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if the length of `lst` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1` where `i` was previously less than `n * 2`.**
