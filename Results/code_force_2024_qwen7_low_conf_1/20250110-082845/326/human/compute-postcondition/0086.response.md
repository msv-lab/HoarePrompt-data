The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` equals 2) from the list `lst`. Initially, `lst` is a list with its first element removed. This means the list originally had at least two elements.

Let's break down the changes:

1. The initial value of `lst` is a list with the first element removed. Let's assume the original list was `[a, b, c, d]` and the first element `a` was removed, making the list `lst = [b, c, d]`.
2. The code removes the element at index 2 (which is `d` in this case) from `lst`, so `lst` now becomes `lst = [b, c]`.

The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `t`, and `ans_f`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `lst` is now `[b, c]`
- `ans` remains unchanged (the value it had before this operation)
- `i` remains unchanged (the value it had before this operation)
- `t` remains unchanged (the value it had before this operation)
- `ans_f` remains unchanged (still contains `[0]`)

Output State: **`lst` is `[b, c]`, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `i` is `n * 2 + 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0.**
