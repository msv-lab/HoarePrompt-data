The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2` from the list `lst`. Since `0 * 2` evaluates to `0`, it removes the first element of `lst`.

From the initial state, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`. Let's denote the original list as `['a', 'b', 'c']` for example purposes, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings. After removing the first element, the list becomes `['b', 'c']`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `ans` is either `3 + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` or `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
- `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.
- `t` is the original input integer.
- `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0.

Since the exact content of `lst` was not specified in the initial state, let's assume `lst` originally had two elements (since removing the first would leave one element).

Let's consider the case where `lst` originally had `['1', '2']`. After removal, `lst` becomes `['2']`.

Given this, `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` would evaluate to `2` because `int('2')` is `2` and there is no second element to compare.

Thus, `ans` could be either `3 + 2` or `2 * 2`, which means `ans` could be `5` or `4`.

The output state is:
- `lst` is `['2']`.
- `ans` is either `5` or `4`.
- `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.
- `t` is the original input integer.
- `ans_f` is `[0]`.

Output State: **`lst` is `['2']`, `ans` is either `5` or `4`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is `[0]`.**
