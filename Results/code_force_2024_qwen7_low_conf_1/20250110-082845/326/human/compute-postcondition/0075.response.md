Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`, `ans` is either `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` or 3, `i` is now `n * 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0. If `len(lst)` is not 2, then `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.**
