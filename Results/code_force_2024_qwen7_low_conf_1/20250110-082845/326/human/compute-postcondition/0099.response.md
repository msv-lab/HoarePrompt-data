Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sums of the minimum values of the pairs of elements from `lst` for each of the `t` iterations.
- `i` is `n * 2`.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in ans_f:
    print(i)
```

### Understanding the Loop:
- The loop iterates over the elements of `ans_f`.
- Each element in `ans_f` is printed during each iteration of the loop.

### Output State Analysis:
- The output state after the loop executes some number of times includes the condition that `ans_f` must contain at least that many elements.
- The loop will continue until there are no more elements left in `ans_f`.

### Final Iterations:
- After the loop has executed all iterations, `ans_f` must be exhausted. This means all elements in `ans_f` have been printed.

### Conclusion:
- Since the loop iterates over all elements in `ans_f`, the final state will be when `ans_f` is empty, meaning there are no more elements to print.
- All elements of `ans_f` have been printed, and `ans_f` itself is now an empty list.

### Output State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `ans_f` is an empty list, since all elements have been printed.
- `i` is no longer relevant since the loop has finished, and it will not be printed anymore.

**Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, and `i` is no longer relevant (since the loop has finished).**
