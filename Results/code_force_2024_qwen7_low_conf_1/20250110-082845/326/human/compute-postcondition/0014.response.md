The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most internal if statement. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables because there is no loop or conditional statement that it would exit. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces and its length is equal to 2.**
