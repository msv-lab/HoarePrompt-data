The code `print(i)` prints the value of `i`, which is initially set to `n * 2`. Since `i` is printed but not reassigned, its value remains unchanged. The output state includes the value of `i` being printed, and the other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is `n * 2`, and the value of `i` (which is `n * 2`) is printed.**
