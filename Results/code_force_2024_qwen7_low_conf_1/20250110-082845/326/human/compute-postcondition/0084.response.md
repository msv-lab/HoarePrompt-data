The code `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` impacts the variable `ans` by adding the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers) to `ans`. Given that `lst` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an original input string `l`, and `ans` is initially set to the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if `len(lst)` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains 3, the value of `ans` is updated.

Since the initial value of `ans` is already determined by the condition, the addition of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` will affect `ans`. The value of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` are converted to integers and their minimum is added to `ans`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `i` is `n * 2 + 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0**
