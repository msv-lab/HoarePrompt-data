To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Initial State
- `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `(n * 2) + 1`.
- `t` is the original input integer.
- `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates `n * 2` times. Let's break down the loop logic:
- If `len(lst)` is not 2, `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the first and second elements of `lst`, and the first and second elements of `lst` are removed.
- If `len(lst)` is 2, `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the first and second elements of `lst`, and the loop breaks.

### Key Observations
- The loop continues to run until `len(lst)` becomes 2 or fewer, or until it reaches `n * 2` iterations.
- Each iteration removes two elements from `lst` if possible.
- Once `len(lst)` is 2 or fewer, the loop breaks even if it hasn't reached `n * 2` iterations.

### Final State Analysis
After `n * 2` iterations:
- If `len(lst)` is 2 or fewer, the loop will break and no further operations will be performed.
- If `len(lst)` is greater than 2, the loop will run exactly `n * 2` times, removing pairs of elements each time.

### Possible Scenarios
1. **Scenario 1: `len(lst)` is 2 or fewer initially or after some iterations**
   - `lst` will remain as it is.
   - `ans` will be the sum of the minimums of pairs of elements removed during the loop.
   - `i` will be `n * 2 + (2 * k)`, where `k` is the number of iterations that actually removed pairs.
   - `t` will be the original input integer.
   - `ans_f` will be `[0]`.

2. **Scenario 2: `len(lst)` is greater than 2 initially and the loop runs fully**
   - `lst` will be reduced to 2 or fewer elements.
   - `ans` will be the sum of the minimums of pairs of elements removed during the loop plus the minimum of the remaining elements if `len(lst)` is 2.
   - `i` will be `n * 2`.
   - `t` will be the original input integer.
   - `ans_f` will be `[0]`.

### Final Output State
Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

**Output State: **`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`. `ans` is the sum of the minimums of pairs of elements removed during the loop plus the minimum of the remaining elements if `len(lst)` is 2. `i` is `n * 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0.**
