Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

- Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is \( n * 2 \).

- Code Snippet: `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])`

- The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` implies that `lst` is being accessed. However, the initial state does not define `lst`. Since `lst` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine what `lst` contains or what removing an element from it will do.

- Given the lack of definition for `lst`, we cannot accurately determine the changes made by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `ans_f`, and `i` remain unchanged.

- The only thing that can be said definitively is that `lst` is being modified (though the exact modification is unknown due to the undefined state of `lst`).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is \( n * 2 \), `lst` is modified.**
