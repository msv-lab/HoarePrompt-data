The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` will remove the element at index `0 * 2`, which is `0`, from the list `lst`. 

In the initial state, the length of `lst` is either 2 or 1. Let's consider both cases:

1. If the length of `lst` is 2:
   - The first element (at index 0) is removed.
   - The list now has only one element (the second element), and the length is now 1.

2. If the length of `lst` is 1:
   - The first element (at index 0) is removed.
   - The list is now empty, and the length is 0.

In both cases, the length of `lst` is now 1. The value of `ans` is updated based on the initial state:
- Initially, `ans` is equal to its initial value plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` if the length is 2, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.

Since the length of `lst` is now 1, `ans` remains unchanged according to the initial condition.

Output State: **`lst` is a list with one element, `ans` is equal to its initial value plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` if the length was 2 initially, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
