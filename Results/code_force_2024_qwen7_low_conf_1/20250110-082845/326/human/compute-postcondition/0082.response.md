Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if `len(lst)` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains 3. `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken if the else part is executed.***
