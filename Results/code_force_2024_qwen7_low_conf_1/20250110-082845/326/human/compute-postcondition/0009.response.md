`ans` is updated by adding the minimum of the integers converted from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. The value of `lst` is unchanged, and the other variables remain as they are.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is its previous value plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, the length of `lst` is not equal to 2**
