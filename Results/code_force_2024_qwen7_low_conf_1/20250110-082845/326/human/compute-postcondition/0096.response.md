The code `print(i)` prints the value of the variable `i`. The value of `i` is the next element in `ans_f` after the one that was printed in the previous iteration. However, since no changes are made to any variables, only the value of `i` is printed, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the next element in `ans_f` after the one that was printed in the previous iteration (value of `i` is printed)**
