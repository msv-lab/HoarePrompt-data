Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`.
   - `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
   - `i` is `n * 2 + 2`.
   - `t` is the original input integer.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0.

2. Code Execution:
   - `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is 0) from the list `lst`.

3. Impact Analysis:
   - The value of `lst[0]` is removed since it is at index 0.
   - All other elements in `lst` remain unchanged.

4. Updated Values:
   - `lst` is now a list with one less element compared to its initial state, specifically, `lst[0]` is no longer present.
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the removal of an element from `lst` does not affect the calculation of `ans` as it was already computed using the first two elements of `lst`.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `ans_f` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list with the first element removed; `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`; `i` is `n * 2 + 2`; `t` is the original input integer; `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0.**
