`lst` is a list with one less element than before, meaning its length is now `len(lst) - 1`. The value of `ans` is still `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` because no changes were made to these elements. The value of `i` is still `n * 2`, as the code only removes an element from the list and does not affect `i`. The value of `t` remains the original input integer, and `ans_f` is still `[0]` since no changes were made to this list.

The code removes the element at index `1 * 2`, which is index `2` in zero-based indexing. Since the list had one less element before, the list now has `len(lst) - 1` elements, and the element at index `2` is removed.

Output State: **`lst` is a list with length `len(lst) - 1`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `i` is `n * 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is `[0]`.**
