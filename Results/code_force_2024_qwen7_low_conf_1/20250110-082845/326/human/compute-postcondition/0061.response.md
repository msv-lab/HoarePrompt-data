The code appends the value of `ans` to `ans_f`. Since `ans` is the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` when the length of `lst` is 2, and `lst` is a list, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `n`, and `t` are not affected.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` as long as the length of `lst` is 2, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is the original input integer, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `ans`**
