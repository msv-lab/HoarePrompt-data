The code `ans = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. The value of `ans_f` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`) also remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is a list containing [0], `i` is \( n * 2 + k + 1 \), `ans` is 0**
