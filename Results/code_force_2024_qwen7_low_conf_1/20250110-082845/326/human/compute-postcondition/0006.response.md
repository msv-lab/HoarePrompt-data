The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the string `l` into a list of substrings based on spaces. The original value of `l` is split into a list, which is stored in `lst`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ans_f`, `i`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces**
