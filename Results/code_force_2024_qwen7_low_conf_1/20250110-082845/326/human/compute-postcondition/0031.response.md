The code `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. Since `ans` is defined as the sum of `min(int(lst[j]), int(lst[k]))` for each pair (j, k) where `lst[j]` and `lst[k]` are the first two elements in `lst` until the condition `len(lst) != 2` no longer holds, and `lst` is updated by removing the first two elements after each iteration, the value of `ans` is calculated only once per execution of the loop. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `ans_f` is an empty list
- `i` is \( n * 2 \)
- `ans` is initially 0 (since the loop might not execute)

After the line `ans_f.append(ans)`, the value of `ans_f` will contain the single element which is the current value of `ans`.

Since `ans` is initialized to 0 and the loop condition involves reducing the length of `lst` to 2, and since no specific `lst` or operations are provided that would modify `ans`, the value of `ans` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is a list containing [0], `i` is \( n * 2 \), `ans` is 0**
