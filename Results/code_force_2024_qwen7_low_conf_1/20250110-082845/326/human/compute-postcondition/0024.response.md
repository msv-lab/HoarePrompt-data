The given code snippet attempts to add the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` to `ans`. However, there is no variable named `ans` in the initial state, only `ans_f` which is an empty list. This means the code would raise a NameError because `ans` is not defined. Since the code cannot be executed due to a NameError, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is \( n * 2 \)**
