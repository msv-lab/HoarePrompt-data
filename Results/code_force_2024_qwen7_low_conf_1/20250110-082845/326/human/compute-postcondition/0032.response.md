Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing [0].
   - `i` is \( n * 2 \).
   - `ans` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in the range of `t`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` starts as \( n * 2 \) and the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been \( n * 2 + k \) where `k` is the number of iterations completed so far.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it \( n * 2 + k + 1 \).

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
   - Given `i = n * 2 + k`, for the next iteration, `i` becomes \( n * 2 + k + 1 \). Therefore, \( n * 2 + k + 1 < t \).

5. **Final States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans_f` remains [0] since the loop body does not modify it.
   - `i` is now \( n * 2 + k + 1 \).
   - `ans` remains 0 since the loop body does not modify it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is a list containing [0], `i` is \( n * 2 + k + 1 \), `ans` is 0**
