The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the string `l` into a list of substrings using the space character as the delimiter. The resulting list is stored in the variable `lst`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing [0], `i` is \( n * 2 + k + 1 \), `ans` is 0, `l` is the user's input, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces**
