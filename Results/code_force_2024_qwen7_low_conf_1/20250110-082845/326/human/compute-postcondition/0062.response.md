Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lst` is a list.
   - `ans` is the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` as long as the length of `lst` is 2.
   - `i` is `n * 2`.
   - `n` is the original input integer.
   - `t` is the original input integer.
   - `ans_f` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `ans`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed:**
   - The loop runs based on the variable `i` which is initialized to `n * 2` and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is `n * 2`.
- `t` is the original input integer.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `i` becomes `(n * 2) + 1`.

Since no other variables depend on the loop's execution directly, we only need to adjust the value of `i`.

**State:**
- `lst` is a list.
- `ans` is the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` as long as the length of `lst` is 2.
- `i` is `(n * 2) + 1`.
- `n` is the original input integer.
- `t` is the original input integer.
- `ans_f` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `ans`.

Thus, the final state is:
**State: **`lst` is a list, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` as long as the length of `lst` is 2, `i` is `(n * 2) + 1, `n` is the original input integer, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `ans`**.
