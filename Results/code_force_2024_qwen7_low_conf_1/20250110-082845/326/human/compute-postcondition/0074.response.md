The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but rather breaks out of the current loop or nested structure. Since there is no loop or nested structure in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`, `ans` is 3, `i` is now `n * 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0, and the length of `lst` is equal to 2.**
