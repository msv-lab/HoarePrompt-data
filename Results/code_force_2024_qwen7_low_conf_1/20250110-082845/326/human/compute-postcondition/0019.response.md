The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index `2` from the list `lst`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \)
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `ans_f` is an empty list
- `i` is \( n * 2 \)
- `ans` is the sum of `ans` and `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`
- The first element of `lst` is removed

Since the code only affects `lst` by removing its element at index `2`, the updated state for `lst` will be missing the element at index `2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \); `n` is a non-negative integer; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is \( n * 2 \); `ans` is the sum of `ans` and `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`; the first element of `lst` is removed; the second element of `lst` is removed from the list `lst`.**
