Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n * 2` (exclusive).
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `0 <= i < n * 2`.

2. **Current State Before the Loop:**
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`.
   - `ans` is `0`.
   - `i` is `(n * 2) + 1`.
   - `t` is the original input integer.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is `0`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n * 2`.
   - Currently, `i` is `(n * 2) + 1`, which means the condition `0 <= i < n * 2` is not satisfied since `(n * 2) + 1` is out of bounds.
   - To make the loop execute, `i` must be set to a value such that `0 <= i < n * 2`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The values of `lst`, `ans`, `t`, and `ans_f` do not directly affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the given information.

### Conclusion:

To make the loop execute, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to be within the range `[0, n * 2)`.

### Final State:

State: **`total` is not relevant here, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`, `ans` is 0, `i` is now `n * 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0**.

In summary, the adjusted state should reflect `i` being `n * 2` so that the loop can start executing.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`, `ans` is 0, `i` is now `n * 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0**.
