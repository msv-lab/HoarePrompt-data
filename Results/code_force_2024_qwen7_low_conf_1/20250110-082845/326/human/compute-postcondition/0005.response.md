`l` is assigned the value of `input()`, which reads a line of input from the user. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `l` is the input string read from the user.
