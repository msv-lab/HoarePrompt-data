The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, it is assumed that the `break` statement might be inside an if condition or a nested structure that is not shown. However, without additional context, the only impact is that the execution will exit the current block.

Given the initial state and the fact that the `break` statement does not modify any variables:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \)
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `ans_f` is an empty list
- `i` is \( n * 2 \)
- `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`

The `break` statement does not affect these values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \); `n` is a non-negative integer; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is \( n * 2 \); `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.**
