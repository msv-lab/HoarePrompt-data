Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`.
   - `ans` is either `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` or 3.
   - `i` is now `n * 2`.
   - `t` is the original input integer.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0.
   - If `len(lst)` is not 2, then `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n * 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n * 2 - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n * 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n * 2`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n * 2`, it needs to be incremented to `n * 2 + 1` to start the next iteration.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `n * 2 + 1`.
   - All other variables (`lst`, `ans`, `t`, `ans_f`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to these variables within the loop.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.
   - `lst` remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ans` remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.
   - `t` remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ans_f` remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`, `ans` is either `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` or 3, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0. If `len(lst)` is not 2, then `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))**.
