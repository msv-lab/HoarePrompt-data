Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `ans_f`. The variable `i` takes the value of each element in `ans_f` during each iteration.

2. **Determine the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing at least two elements.
   - `i` is the next element in `ans_f` after the one that was printed in the previous iteration (the value of `i` is printed).

3. **Understand the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `ans_f` after the one that was printed in the previous iteration, we need to identify the current `i` and the subsequent elements in the list.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next element in `ans_f`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - After printing the previous `i`, the next `i` in `ans_f` will be the next element in the list.
   - `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `ans_f` should now contain the next element after the one that was printed in the previous iteration.
   - `i` will be the next element in `ans_f`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `t` remains the same because it is not part of the loop.
- `n` remains the same because it is not part of the loop.
- `ans_f` will now contain the next element after the one that was printed in the previous iteration.
- `i` will be the next element in `ans_f`.

Since we don't know the exact value of the next `i` in the list, we can represent it as the next element in `ans_f`.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the next element in `ans_f`**
