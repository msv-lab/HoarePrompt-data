Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is \( n * 2 \). If `len(lst)` is not 2, `ans` remains unchanged. If `len(lst)` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the first two elements of `lst` are removed.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering the condition `len(lst) != 2` and the operation when `len(lst) == 2`.
