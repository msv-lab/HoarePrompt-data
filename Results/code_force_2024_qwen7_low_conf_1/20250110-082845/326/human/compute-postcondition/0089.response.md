Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of strings. If `len(lst)` is not 2, `lst` remains as is, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if `len(lst)` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains 3, `i` is `n * 2 + 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing one element which is 0. If `len(lst)` is 2, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `i` is `n * 2 + 2`, `t` is 4, `ans_f` is [0].***
