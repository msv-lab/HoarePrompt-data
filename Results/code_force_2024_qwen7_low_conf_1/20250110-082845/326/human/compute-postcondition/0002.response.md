State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is unknown, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t)`, which means `i` will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start from 0 (the initial value in `range(t)`).
3. The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will run. Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, the loop will execute at least once.
4. The variable `n` is mentioned but its state does not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.
5. `ans_f` being an empty list is a starting condition and does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` starts at 0, while acknowledging that `n` is unknown and `ans_f` remains an empty list.
