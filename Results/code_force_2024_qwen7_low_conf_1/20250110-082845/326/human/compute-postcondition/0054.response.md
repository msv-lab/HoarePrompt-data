The code updates `ans` to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` only if the length of `lst` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. Also, `i` is incremented by 1. 

Given this, let's break down the impact:

- If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
- If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` remains unchanged.
- Regardless of the length of `lst`, `i` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if the length of `lst` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `i` is `i + 1`.**
