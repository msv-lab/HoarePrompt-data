`ans` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `t` remains unchanged because there is no code that affects it. The values of `n` and `i` also remain unchanged since they are not used or modified in this code snippet. The state of `ans_f` as an empty list is also preserved.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is unknown, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0**
