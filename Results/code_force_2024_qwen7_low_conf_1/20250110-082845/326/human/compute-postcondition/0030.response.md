Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is \( n * 2 \), `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[j]), int(lst[k]))` for each pair (j, k) where `lst[j]` and `lst[k]` are the first two elements in `lst` until the condition `len(lst) != 2` no longer holds, `lst` is the list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with the first two elements removed after each iteration as long as `len(lst) == 2`. If the loop does not execute, `ans` remains 0.**
