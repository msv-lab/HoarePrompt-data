The code appends the value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. Since `ans_f` was initially `[0]`, appending `ans` to it results in `ans_f` becoming `[0, ans]`. The value of `ans` itself does not change, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the original input string `l`. `ans` is the sum of the minimums of pairs of elements removed during the loop plus the minimum of the remaining elements if `len(lst)` is 2. `i` is `n * 2`, `t` is the original input integer, `ans_f` is a list containing two elements `[0, ans]`.**
