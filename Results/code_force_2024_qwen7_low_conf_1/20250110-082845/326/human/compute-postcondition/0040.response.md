The code removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which simplifies to `0`. Since `lst` is a list with a length not equal to 2, the first element (`lst[0]`) is removed. This does not affect the value of `ans`, which was updated by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to its current value.

Output State: **`lst` is a list with a length not equal to 2, and the first element is removed; `ans` is updated by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to its current value.**
