The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index `2` from the list `lst`. Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step:

1. The index `[1 * 2]` evaluates to `[2]`.
2. The list `lst` has its second element (index 2) removed.

Since the exact values in `lst` are not given, we know only that `lst` is modified by removing its third element (considering the first element as index 0). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0, the length of `lst` is reduced by one, the third element of `lst` is removed.**
