The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is `0`) from the list `lst`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \)
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `ans_f` is an empty list
- `i` is \( n * 2 \)
- `ans` is the sum of `ans` and `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`

After executing the line `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])`, the first element of `lst` is removed. The value of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \); `n` is a non-negative integer; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is \( n * 2 \); `ans` is the sum of `ans` and `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`; the first element of `lst` is removed.**
