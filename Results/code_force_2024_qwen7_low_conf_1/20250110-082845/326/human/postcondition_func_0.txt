The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( 2n \) positive integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of elements from the list and stores these sums in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each sum in the list. The function handles up to 5000 test cases, with \( n \) ranging from 1 to 50 and each element in the list ranging from 1 to \( 10^7 \).
