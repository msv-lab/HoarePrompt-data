Precondition: **(r, c) are positive integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50. initial_grid and final_grid are 2D lists of strings representing the initial and final positions of Amanda, respectively. Each string in initial_grid and final_grid contains c characters, and there are r such strings. The characters in these grids are either '.', '*', or 'X'. The initial_position and final_position are tuples of integers representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial and final positions, respectively. Both positions guarantee that Amanda's body is connected and that the number of pixels forming her body is the same in both positions.**
