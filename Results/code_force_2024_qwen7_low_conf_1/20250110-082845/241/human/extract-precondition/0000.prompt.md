You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: This problem has an attachment. You can use it to simulate and visualize the
movements of the amoeba.

Amoeba Amanda lives inside a rectangular grid of square pixels. Her body
occupies some of these pixels. Other pixels may be either free or blocked.
Amanda moves across the grid using the so-called amoeboid movement. In each
step of such a movement, her body first shrinks by one pixel (one pixel of the
body is removed and becomes free), and then grows at a different place (one
previously-free pixel is added to the body).

To prevent structural damage, Amanda's body always occupies a connected region
of pixels, which means that any pair of pixels forming the body can be
connected by a sequence of adjacent pixels without ever leaving the body. Two
pixels are considered adjacent if they share a common side (each pixel has at
most 4 neighbours). The body remains connected even during the movement,
including the moment after removing a pixel and before adding another one.

Your task is to help Amanda find her way around. Given her initial position
and desired final position, suggest a sequence of valid moves leading from the
former to the latter.

Illustration of sample 1 : The filled shape is the initial position, the
dotted region is the final position.

Input

The first line contains two integers r and c (1\le r,c \le 50 ) — the size of
the rectangular grid in pixels.

The next r lines contain c characters each, describing the initial position of
Amanda. Each of those characters is either a dot \texttt{.} denoting a free
pixel, an asterisk \texttt{*} denoting Amanda's body, or an \texttt{X}
denoting a blocked pixel which may never be occupied.

The next line is empty.

The next r lines describe the desired final position in the same format as the
initial position.

It is guaranteed that:

  * The number of pixels forming Amanda's body is the same in both positions, and it is at least 2. 
  * The body of Amanda is connected in the initial position. 
  * The body of Amanda is connected in the final position. 
  * The blocked pixels do not change between the descriptions of the initial and final position, their placement is exactly the same in both positions. 

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible for Amanda to go from the initial
position to the final one. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

If it is possible, on the next line print one integer m (0\le m\le 10\,000 ) —
the number of moves to execute.

The following m lines must contain four integer coordinates each: i_1 , j_1 ,
i_2 , j_2 (1\le i_1,i_2\le r , 1\le j_1,j_2\le c ). These four coordinates
specify one move, meaning that the pixel at i_1 -th row and j_1 -th column is
first removed from the body. Then, (i_2,j_2) must designate a different
location where one pixel is added.

The sequence should consist only of valid moves and after the last move,
Amanda's body should occupy the desired final position.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Under the assumptions of this problem, it can be proven that if it is possible
for Amanda to go from the initial position to the desired final one, then it
is possible to do it with at most 10\,000 moves.

Note

In the first sample, Amanda executes 5 moves to reach the final position, as
shown in the figure below.
