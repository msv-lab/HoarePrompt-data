The code sets `final_position` to `(i, j)`. From the initial state, we know that `j` is 2, so `final_position` is updated to `(i, 2)`. The other variables (`r`, `c`, `initial_position`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `initial_position` is (i, 2), `final_position` is (i, 2)**
