Postcondition: ***`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j) if `initial_grid[i][j]` was '*', `final_position` remains unchanged, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `i` is an integer, `j` is within the range [0, c-1], and the current value of `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `initial_grid[i][j]` was '*'***

This postcondition includes all the details from the precondition and adds the condition specified in the if statement, ensuring that the state of the program after entering the if condition is accurately described.
