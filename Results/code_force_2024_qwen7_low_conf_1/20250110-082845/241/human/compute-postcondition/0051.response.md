Postcondition: ***`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j) if `initial_grid[i][j]` was '*', `final_position` remains unchanged, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `i` is an integer, and `j` is within the range [0, c-1]. If `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is (i, j). Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block execution.***
