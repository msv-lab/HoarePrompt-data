Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates through each row `i` from `0` to `r-1` and for each row, it iterates through each column `j` from `0` to `c-1`.
2. **Setting `initial_position` and `final_position`**:
   - `initial_position` is set to `(i, j)` if `initial_grid[i][j]` is `'*'`.
   - `final_position` is set to `(i, j)` if `final_grid[i][j]` is `'*'`.
   - These positions are updated to the last occurrence of `'*'` in their respective grids.
3. **Final Values**:
   - If `initial_grid` and `final_grid` do not contain `'*'` in any row, both `initial_position` and `final_position` will remain `None`.
   - Otherwise, `initial_position` and `final_position` will be the coordinates of the last `'*'` found in `initial_grid` and `final_grid`, respectively.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final values of `initial_position` and `final_position` will reflect the last positions where `'*'` was found in `initial_grid` and `final_grid`, respectively.
