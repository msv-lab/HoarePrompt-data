Functionality: **The function `func_3` reads the dimensions of two 2D grids (`r` and `c`), along with their contents (`initial_grid` and `final_grid`), and the coordinates of Amanda's initial and final positions. It then calls another function `func_2` to determine if it's possible to transform `initial_grid` into `final_grid` by moving Amanda's body. If such a transformation is possible, the function prints "YES", the number of moves required, and the sequence of moves. If no transformation is possible, it prints "NO". The function handles edge cases where `r` and `c` are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50). Potential edge cases include invalid grid inputs (e.g., non-square grids, invalid characters) which are not explicitly handled in the given code, and the possibility that Amanda's body might not be connected or have the same number of pixels in both positions, which is also not checked.**
