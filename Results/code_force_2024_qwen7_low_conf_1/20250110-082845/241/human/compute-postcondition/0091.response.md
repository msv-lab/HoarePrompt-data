Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `q` is empty
- `current_position` is `parent_position`
- `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`
- `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path
- `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary
- `moves` is `[((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))]`
- `parent_position` is the value of `parent[current_position]`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while current_position != initial_position:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
For the loop to continue executing, the condition `current_position != initial_position` must be true. This means that `current_position` must still be different from `initial_position`.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `current_position` is equal to `parent_position`
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `parent_position` must still be different from `initial_position`.

### Required Adjustments
Since the only state that directly affects the loop condition is `current_position`, we need to ensure that `parent_position` (which is the same as `current_position`) is still different from `initial_position`.

### New State
State: **`q` is empty, `current_position` is `parent_position` and must be different from `initial_position`, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `moves` is `[((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))]`, `parent_position` is the value of `parent[current_position]`**.

Thus, the final state to proceed to the next iteration of the loop is:

**`q` is empty, `current_position` is `parent_position` and must be different from `initial_position`, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `moves` is `[((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))]`, `parent_position` is the value of `parent[current_position]`**.
