The code `final_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `final_position`. This means that `final_position` now holds the coordinates `(i, j)`, which were already defined in the initial state.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j), `final_position` is (i, j), `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, and the current value of `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'.
