Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` was '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` was '*', `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `i` is `r`, `j` is `c - 1`. If there was no '*', then `initial_position` and `final_position` will be None.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution:** The loop iterates over each column `j` from 0 to `c-1`.
2. **Initial Position:** The `initial_position` is updated whenever `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'. Since the loop runs for all columns, the last update to `initial_position` will be the last column where `initial_grid[i][j]` was '*'.
3. **Final Position:** Similarly, the `final_position` is updated whenever `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'. Since the loop runs for all columns, the last update to `final_position` will be the last column where `final_grid[i][j]` was '*'.
4. **Final Values of Variables:**
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. After all iterations, `i` will be `r`.
   - `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. After all iterations, `j` will be `c - 1`.
5. **Original Values:** The original values of `r` and `c` must be greater than 0 and at least 1, respectively.
6. **Conditions:** If no `'*'` is found in either `initial_grid` or `final_grid`, then `initial_position` and/or `final_position` will remain `None`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `initial_position` and `final_position` will hold the coordinates of the last `'*'` found in `initial_grid` and `final_grid`, respectively, and `i` and `j` will be `r` and `c - 1`, respectively. If no `'*'` is found, these variables will remain `None`.
