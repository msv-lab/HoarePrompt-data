The code assigns the value of `parent[current_position]` to `parent_position`. This updates the value of `parent_position` but does not change the values of other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `parent_position` and keeps the values of other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `current_position` must be a position in the `parent` dictionary and not equal to `initial_position`, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `moves` is an empty list, `parent_position` is the value of `parent[current_position]`**
