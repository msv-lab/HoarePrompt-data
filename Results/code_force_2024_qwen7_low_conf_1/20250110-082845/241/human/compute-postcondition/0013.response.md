Postcondition: ***`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `initial_position` is (i, 0), `final_position` is (i, 0), `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, and `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input. If `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', then `final_position` is set to (i, 0). Otherwise, the `final_position` remains unchanged.***
