The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `initial_position`. Therefore, `initial_position` is updated to `(i, j)`, while other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j), `final_position` remains unchanged, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `i` is an integer, `j` is within the range `[0, c-1]`, and the current value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'**
