The code initializes an empty list called `moves`. This does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `current_position` is the last position Amanda visited, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `moves` is an empty list**
