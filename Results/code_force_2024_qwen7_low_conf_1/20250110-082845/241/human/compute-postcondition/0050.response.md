The code sets `final_position` to `(i, j)`. This means that the value of `final_position` is now explicitly defined as `(i, j)`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j) if `initial_grid[i][j]` was '*', `final_position` is (i, j), `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `i` is an integer, `j` is within the range [0, c-1], and the current value of `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'**
