Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is either (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` was '*' during the loop execution or None if there was no '*', `final_position` is either (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` was '*' during the loop execution or None if there was no '*', `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each column `j` in the range `c`.
- If `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `initial_position` is set to `(i, j)`.
- If `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is set to `(i, j)`.
- The loop will continue to iterate until all columns `j` have been checked.

After the loop completes:
- `initial_position` will be set to the coordinates of the first '*' found in `initial_grid` or remain `None` if no '*' is found.
- `final_position` will be set to the coordinates of the first '*' found in `final_grid` or remain `None` if no '*' is found.
- The values of `r`, `c`, `initial_grid`, and `final_grid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
