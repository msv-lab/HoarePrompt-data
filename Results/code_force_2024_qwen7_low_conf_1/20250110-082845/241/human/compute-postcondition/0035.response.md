Postcondition: ***`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j), `final_position` is (i, j), `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading r lines of input, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, and `j` is incremented by 1. If the element at `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', the postcondition remains as above.***
