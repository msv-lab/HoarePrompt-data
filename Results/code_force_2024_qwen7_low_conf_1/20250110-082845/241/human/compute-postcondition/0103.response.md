Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list of strings `grid`, two positive integers `r` and `c` representing the dimensions of the grid, and two tuples `initial_position` and `final_position` representing Amanda's starting and desired final positions. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find a path from `initial_position` to `final_position` in the grid. If such a path exists, it returns a list of tuples, each representing a move Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position` but in reverse order. If no path exists, it returns `None`.

The function first initializes a `visited` 2D list to keep track of visited cells, a queue `q` to manage the BFS traversal, and a `parent` dictionary to store the parent positions of each cell in the path. It then performs a BFS traversal from `initial_position`. During the traversal, it checks if the current cell is the `final_position`. If it finds a valid path to the `final_position`, it constructs a list of moves by backtracking through the `parent` dictionary. Finally, it reverses the list of moves and returns it. If no path is found, it returns `None`.

Potential edge cases include:
1. The `initial_position` and `final_position` being the same, in which case the function should return an empty list or `None` depending on the design.
2. The grid being empty or invalid (e.g., non-rectangular).
3. Cells that are not traversable (e.g., obstacles represented by specific characters in the grid).

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the grid contains obstacles or walls that Amanda cannot pass through. This could be added by modifying the `func_1` function to check for obstacles before allowing movement to adjacent cells.**
