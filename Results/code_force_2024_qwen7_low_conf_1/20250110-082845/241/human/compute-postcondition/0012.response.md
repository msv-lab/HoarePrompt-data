The code `final_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `final_position`. The values of `i` and `j` are known from the initial state: `i` is part of the `initial_position` which is `(i, 0)`, and `j` is explicitly given as `0`.

Therefore, the updated value of `final_position` is `(i, 0)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `initial_position` is (i, 0), `final_position` is (i, 0), `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, and `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input. The current value of `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', indicating that the position (i, j) contains '*'**
