The function `func_3` accepts the following parameters:
- `r` and `c` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50.
- `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the initial position of Amanda.
- `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the final position of Amanda.
- `initial_position` is a tuple of integers representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial position.
- `final_position` is a tuple of integers representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the final position.

Each string in `initial_grid` and `final_grid` contains `c` characters, and there are `r` such strings. The characters in these grids are either '.', '*', or 'X'.

The functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept these parameters and determine some condition or perform some operation based on the given grids and positions. However, since the specific output cases are not detailed, we can only describe the parameters accepted and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r` and `c` (positive integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50), `initial_grid` and `final_grid` (2D lists of strings representing Amanda's initial and final positions), `initial_position` and `final_position` (tuples of integers representing Amanda's body coordinates in the respective positions).**
