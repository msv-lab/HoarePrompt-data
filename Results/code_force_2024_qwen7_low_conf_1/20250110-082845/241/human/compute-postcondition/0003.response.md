`final_grid` is assigned a new value by creating a list comprehension that reads `r` lines of input. Each line is expected to represent a row in the grid. The initial values of `r` and `c` are provided by input, and they determine the number of rows and columns in the grid. The other variables (`initial_position`, `final_position`, and `initial_grid`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`r` is an integer provided by input, `c` is an integer provided by input, `initial_position` is a tuple of integers representing Amanda's initial position, `final_position` is a tuple of integers representing Amanda's final position, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, and `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input.**
