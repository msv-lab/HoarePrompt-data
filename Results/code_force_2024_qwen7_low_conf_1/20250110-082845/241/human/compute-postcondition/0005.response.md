The code sets `final_position` to `None`. This means that the previous value of `final_position`, which was a tuple of integers representing Amanda's final position, is no longer valid and is now set to `None`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`r` is an integer provided by input, `c` is an integer provided by input, `initial_position` is `None`, `final_position` is `None`, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, and `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input.**
