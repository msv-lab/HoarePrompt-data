Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `r` must be greater than 0.
- `c` must be at least 1.
- `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'.
- `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'.
- `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input.
- `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input.
- `moves` is a non-empty sequence resulting from `func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)`.

### For Loop:
```
for move in moves:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `moves` list. The `moves` list is generated by the function `func_2`, which takes `initial_grid`, `r`, `c`, `initial_position`, and `final_position` as inputs. Since we know that `moves` is a non-empty sequence, the loop will execute if `moves` is not empty.

### Necessary Adjustments:
To ensure the loop can execute, the only state that needs adjustment is to confirm that `moves` is indeed a non-empty sequence. However, since it is given that `moves` is non-empty, no additional state needs to be modified to ensure the loop can execute.

### Final Answer:
Since the `moves` list is already guaranteed to be non-empty, no state needs to be adjusted beyond what is already given.

State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `moves` is a non-empty sequence resulting from `func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)`**.
