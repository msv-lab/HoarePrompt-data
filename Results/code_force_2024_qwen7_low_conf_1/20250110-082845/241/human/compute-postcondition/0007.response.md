Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `r` must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is an integer provided by input.
   - `initial_position` is `None`.
   - `final_position` is `None`.
   - `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input.
   - `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs over `j` where `j` ranges from `0` to `c-1`.

3. **Determining Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, the value of `c` must be at least 1 (since `range(c)` will run from `0` to `c-1`, meaning there must be at least one iteration).
   - The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `c-1`.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, the following adjustments are necessary:
- `c` must be at least 1.
- `j` should start at 0, as the loop will increment `j` in each iteration.

Given these points, the states that need adjustment are:
- `c` must be at least 1.
- `j` should be initialized to 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `initial_position` is `None`, `final_position` is `None`, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input**
