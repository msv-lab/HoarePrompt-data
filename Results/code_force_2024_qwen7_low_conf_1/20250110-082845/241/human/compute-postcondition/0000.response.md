The code `r, c = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `r` and `c`. Since the initial values of `r` and `c` are defined as positive integers between 1 and 50, the values of `r` and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input. The initial conditions about `initial_grid` and `final_grid`, `initial_position`, and `final_position` remain unchanged.

Output State: **r and c are updated to the integers provided by the input, initial_grid and final_grid are 2D lists of strings representing the initial and final positions of Amanda, initial_position and final_position are tuples of integers representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial and final positions, respectively.**
