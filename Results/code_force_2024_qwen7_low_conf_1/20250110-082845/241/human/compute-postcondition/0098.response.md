The code `current_position = parent_position` updates the value of `current_position` to be the same as `parent_position`. According to the initial state, `parent_position` is equal to `parent[current_position]`. Therefore, `current_position` will now be equal to `parent[current_position]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `q` remains empty.
- `visited` remains a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`.
- `parent` remains a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path.
- `final_position` remains not in the `parent` dictionary.
- `parent_position` remains equal to `parent[current_position]`.
- `moves` remains containing the tuple `(current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1)`.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `current_position` is equal to `parent[current_position]`, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `parent_position` is equal to `parent[current_position]`, `moves` contains the tuple `(current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1)`**
