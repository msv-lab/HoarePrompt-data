The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `grid`: a 2D list of strings.
- `r`: a positive integer representing the number of rows in the grid.
- `c`: a positive integer representing the number of columns in the grid.
- `initial_position`: a tuple of two integers (i, j) representing Amanda's starting position.
- `final_position`: a tuple of two integers (i, j) representing Amanda's desired final position.

The function returns:
- Case_1: `None`
- Case_2: A list `moves` containing tuples that represent the sequence of moves Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position` but in reverse order.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a 2D list of strings `grid`, and two tuples `initial_position` and `final_position`, and either return `None` or a list `moves` containing the sequence of Amanda's moves from `initial_position` to `final_position` in reverse order.
Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list of strings `grid`, two positive integers `r` and `c` representing the dimensions of the grid, and two tuples `initial_position` and `final_position` representing Amanda's starting and desired final positions. It returns `None` or a list `moves` containing tuples that represent the sequence of moves Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position` but in reverse order.**
