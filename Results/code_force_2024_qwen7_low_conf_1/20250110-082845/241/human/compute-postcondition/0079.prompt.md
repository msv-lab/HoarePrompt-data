You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (r, c) are positive integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50. initial_grid and final_grid are 2D lists of strings representing the initial and final positions of Amanda, respectively. Each string in initial_grid and final_grid contains c characters, and there are r such strings. The characters in these grids are either '.', '*', or 'X'. The initial_position and final_position are tuples of integers representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial and final positions, respectively. Both positions guarantee that Amanda's body is connected and that the number of pixels forming her body is the same in both positions.
def func_3():
    r, c = map(int, input().split())
    initial_grid = [input() for _ in range(r)]
    input()
    final_grid = [input() for _ in range(r)]
    initial_position = None
    final_position = None
    for i in range(r):
        for j in range(c):
            if initial_grid[i][j] == '*':
                initial_position = i, j
            if final_grid[i][j] == '*':
                final_position = i, j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input.
    moves = func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)
    if moves :
        print('YES')
        print(len(moves))
        for move in moves:
            print(*move)
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `moves` is a list containing all the moves required to transform `initial_grid` into `final_grid`, the length of `moves` is printed.
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `moves` is a list representing the moves required to transform `initial_grid` into `final_grid`, if `moves` is non-empty, the length of `moves` is printed. If `moves` is empty, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `r` and `c` (positive integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50), `initial_grid` and `final_grid` (2D lists of strings representing Amanda's initial and final positions), `initial_position` and `final_position` (tuples of integers representing Amanda's body coordinates in the respective positions).

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
