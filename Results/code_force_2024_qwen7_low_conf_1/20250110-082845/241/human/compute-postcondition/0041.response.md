The code sets `final_position` to `(i, j)`, which are already the values of `i` and `j`. No other variables are affected. The conditions and values of the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j), `final_position` is (i, j), `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, and `j` must be less than `c`.**
