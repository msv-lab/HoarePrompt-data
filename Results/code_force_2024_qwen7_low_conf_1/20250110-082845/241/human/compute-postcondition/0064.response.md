The function `func_2` is called with the parameters `initial_grid`, `r`, `c`, `initial_position`, and `final_position`. The function likely returns a value representing the moves required to transition from `initial_position` to `final_position` in the grid. However, since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `moves`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `moves` is the result of `func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)`**
