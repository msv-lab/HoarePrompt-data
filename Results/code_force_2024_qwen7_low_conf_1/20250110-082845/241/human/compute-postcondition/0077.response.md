Postcondition: ***`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `moves` is a list representing the moves required to transform `initial_grid` into `final_grid`, if `moves` is non-empty, the length of `moves` is printed. If `moves` is empty, the output is 'NO'.***
