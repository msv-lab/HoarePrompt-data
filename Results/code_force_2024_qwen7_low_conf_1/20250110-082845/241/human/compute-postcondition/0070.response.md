According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `moves` list. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more move in the `moves` list.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are true:
- `r` must be greater than 0
- `c` must be at least 1
- `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'
- `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'
- The `moves` list is printed, and we break out of the print statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `moves` list must contain at least one more element. Therefore, the `moves` list should be updated to reflect this.

State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `moves` list must have at least one more element**
