The code `moves.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in the `moves` list. Since `moves` originally contains tuples representing the sequence of moves Amanda made, reversing it means the first move in the original list will now be the last, and the last move will now be the first.

- `q` remains empty as no operations are performed on it.
- `current_position` remains the initial position of Amanda since no operation affects it.
- `visited` remains unchanged as no operation modifies this list.
- `parent` remains unchanged as no operation modifies this dictionary.
- `final_position` remains not in the `parent` dictionary as no operation changes this condition.
- `moves` is reversed, so the sequence of moves is in reverse order.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `current_position` is the initial position of Amanda, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `moves` is a list containing tuples representing the sequence of moves Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position` but in reverse order.**
