Output State: **`current_position` is valid and split into `i` and `j`; `q` is a queue of positions; `i` and `j` are updated based on the directions from `[(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]`; if `func_1(grid, r, c, visited, i, j, ni, nj)` returns `True` for any iteration, then for each such iteration, `visited[ni][nj]` is set to `True` and `parent[ni, nj]` is updated to `(i, j)`. The loop terminates if `i` equals `final_position`. If the loop does not execute, `current_position` remains the same, `q` remains unchanged, and `i` and `j` remain unchanged.**
