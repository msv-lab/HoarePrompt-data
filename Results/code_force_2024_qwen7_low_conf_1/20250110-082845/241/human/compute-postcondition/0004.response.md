The code sets `initial_position` to `None`. This means that the value of `initial_position` is no longer the tuple of integers representing Amanda's initial position, but rather `None`. The other variables (`c`, `r`, `final_position`, `final_grid`, and `initial_grid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is an integer provided by input, `c` is an integer provided by input, `initial_position` is `None`, `final_position` is a tuple of integers representing Amanda's final position, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, and `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input.**
