The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables; it simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is the output of the program, which is 'YES', but this does not alter the values of the variables.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `moves` is the result of `func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)` and is truthy (non-empty), and the output is 'YES'**.
