The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variable `initial_position`. The values of `i` and `j` are known because they are indices pointing to a position containing '*' in `initial_grid`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j), `final_position` is None, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, the current value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', and the indices `i` and `j` point to a position containing '*' in `initial_grid`**
