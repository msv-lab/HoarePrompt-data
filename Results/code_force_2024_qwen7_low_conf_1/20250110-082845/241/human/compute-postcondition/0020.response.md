The code assigns the value of `(i, j)` to `initial_position`. The previous value of `initial_position` was `(i, 1)`, and now it is updated to `(i, 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `initial_position` is (i, 2), `final_position` is (i, 1)**
