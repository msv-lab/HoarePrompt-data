Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `r` must be greater than 0.
   - `c` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `initial_position` is `(i, 1)`.
   - `final_position` is `(i, 1)`.
   - If `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', then `initial_position` remains `(i, 1)`. Otherwise, the position remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts with `j = 1` and iterates up to `c-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` was 1 at the start of the loop.
   - After the first iteration, `j` would become 2.

4. **Conditions After First Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is now 2, we need to check the condition for the next iteration of the loop.
   - The loop will continue if `j < c`.

5. **Updating States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `c` must still be at least 1 (which it is, since it was at least 1 initially and hasn't changed).
   - `r` must still be greater than 0.
   - The `initial_position` and `final_position` will remain unchanged unless `final_grid[i][2]` is '*', but since the initial positions were not changed in the previous iteration, they remain `(i, 1)`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `j` should be 2.
- `c` must be at least 1.
- `r` must be greater than 0.
- `initial_position` remains `(i, 1)`.
- `final_position` remains `(i, 1)`.

**State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `initial_position` is (i, 1), `final_position` is (i, 1)**
