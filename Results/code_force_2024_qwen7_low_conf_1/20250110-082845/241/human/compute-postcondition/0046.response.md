Postcondition: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is either (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` was '*' during the loop execution or None if there was no '*', `final_position` is either (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` was '*' during the loop execution or None if there was no '*', `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `i` is an integer, `j` is within the range `[0, c-1]`, and the current value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` remains unchanged**
