The code assigns the value of `parent[current_position]` to `parent_position`. This means that the value of `parent_position` is updated to the value stored in `parent[current_position]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `current_position` is `parent_position` and must be different from `initial_position`, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `moves` is `[((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))]`, `parent_position` is the value of `parent[current_position]`**
