The code `current_position = final_position` updates the value of `current_position` to be the same as `final_position`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `current_position` is `final_position`, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `moves` is an empty list**
