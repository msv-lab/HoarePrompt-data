Output State: **`q` is empty, `current_position` is the initial position of Amanda, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `moves` is a list containing tuples representing the sequence of moves Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position`, each tuple is `(parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1)`**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`.
- In each iteration, `current_position` is updated to `parent_position`, and a move is appended to the `moves` list.
- Eventually, `current_position` will become `initial_position`, at which point the loop terminates.
- At this point, `current_position` will hold the value of `initial_position`.
- The `moves` list will contain the sequence of moves Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position`.
- All other variables (`q`, `visited`, `parent`, and `final_position`) remain unchanged.
