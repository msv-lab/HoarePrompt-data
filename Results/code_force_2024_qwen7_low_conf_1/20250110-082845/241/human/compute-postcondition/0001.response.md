`initial_grid` is assigned the value of a list comprehension that reads `r` lines of input, converting each line into a string. The variables `r`, `c`, `initial_position`, `final_position`, and `final_grid` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`r` is an integer provided by input, `c` is an integer provided by input, `initial_position` is a tuple of integers representing Amanda's initial position, `final_position` is a tuple of integers representing Amanda's final position, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings representing Amanda's final positions, and `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input.**
