Postcondition: ***`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `initial_position` is (i, 1), `final_position` is either (i, 0) or (i, 1) depending on the value of `final_grid[i][1]`, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, and `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input. If `initial_grid[i][1]` is '*', then `initial_position` is updated to (i, 1). Otherwise, the position remains unchanged.***
