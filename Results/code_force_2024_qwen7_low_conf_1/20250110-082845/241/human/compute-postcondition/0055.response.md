The code sets `final_position` to `(i, j)`. This means that the value of `final_position` is now explicitly defined as `(i, j)`, while the values of other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes this new assignment.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j), `final_position` is (i, j), `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `i` is an integer, and `j` is 0. If `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
