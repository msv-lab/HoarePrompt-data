You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: grid is a 2D list of strings representing the initial and final positions, r and c are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, initial_position is a tuple of two integers (i, j) representing the starting position of Amanda's body, and final_position is a tuple of two integers (i, j) representing the desired final position of Amanda's body.
def func_2(grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position):
    visited = [([False] * c) for _ in range(r)]
    q = deque()
    q.append(initial_position)
    visited[initial_position[0]][initial_position[1]] = True
    parent = {}
    while q:
        current_position = q.popleft()
        
        if current_position == final_position:
            break
        
        i, j = current_position
        
        for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if func_1(grid, r, c, visited, i, j, ni, nj):
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                q.append((ni, nj))
                parent[ni, nj] = i, j
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'q' is empty, `current_position` is the last position Amanda visited, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, and `func_1(grid, r, c, visited, i, j, ni, nj)` returns `True` for at least one iteration where `(ni, nj)` is the final position.
    if (final_position not in parent) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: 'q' is empty, `current_position` is the last position Amanda visited, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, and `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary
    moves = []
    current_position = final_position
    while current_position != initial_position:
        parent_position = parent[current_position]
        
        moves.append((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1, 
            current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))
        
        current_position = parent_position
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `q` is empty, `current_position` is the initial position of Amanda, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `moves` is a list containing tuples representing the sequence of moves Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position`, each tuple is `(parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1)`
    moves.reverse()
    return moves
    #The program returns a list `moves` containing tuples that represent the sequence of moves Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position` but in reverse order
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a 2D list of strings `grid`, two positive integers `r` and `c` representing the dimensions of the grid, and two tuples `initial_position` and `final_position` representing Amanda's starting and desired final positions. It returns `None` or a list `moves` containing tuples that represent the sequence of moves Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position` but in reverse order.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns a list `moves` containing tuples that represent the sequence of moves Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position` but in reverse order


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
