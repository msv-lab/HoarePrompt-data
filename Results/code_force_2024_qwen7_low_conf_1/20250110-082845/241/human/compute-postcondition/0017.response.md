The code `final_position = i, j` updates the value of `final_position` to `(i, j)`. Given the initial state, `i` is part of the `initial_position` which is either `(i, 1)` or `(i, 0)` depending on the value of `initial_grid[i][1]`. Since `j` is initially set to `1`, it does not change unless specified otherwise in the code.

Therefore, `final_position` will be `(i, 1)` because `j` is set to `1` and it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `initial_position` is (i, 1), `final_position` is (i, 1)**
