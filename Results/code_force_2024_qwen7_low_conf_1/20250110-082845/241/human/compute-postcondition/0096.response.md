The code assigns the value of `parent[current_position]` to `parent_position`. This means that the value of `parent_position` is updated to the value stored in `parent` at the key `current_position`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `current_position` is not equal to `parent_position` and is not equal to `initial_position`, `visited` is a 2D list where every cell Amanda visited is marked as `True`, `parent` is a dictionary where each key-value pair represents the position and its parent position in Amanda's path, `final_position` is not in the `parent` dictionary, `parent_position` is equal to `parent[current_position]`.**
