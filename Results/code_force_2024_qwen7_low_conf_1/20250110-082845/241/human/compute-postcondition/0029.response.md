Postcondition: ***`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j), `final_position` is None, `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, and if `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', then `initial_position` is set to (i, j). If `initial_grid[i][j]` is not '*', then no changes occur to the variables.***
