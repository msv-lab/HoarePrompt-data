Postcondition: ***`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is (i, j), `final_position` is (i, j), `final_grid` is a 2D list of strings created by reading `r` lines of input, `initial_grid` is a 2D list of strings read from the input, and `j` must be less than `c`. If `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the final state does not change from the precondition.***
