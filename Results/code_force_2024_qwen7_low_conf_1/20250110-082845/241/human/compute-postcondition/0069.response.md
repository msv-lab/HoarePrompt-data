The code snippet prints the elements of the `moves` list using the `*` operator, which unpacks the list and prints its elements separated by spaces. The `moves` list is generated by the function `func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)`. However, the actual content of `moves` is not specified in the initial state or by the function call itself. Therefore, the only change made by this code is the printing of the elements of `moves`.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be at least 1, `initial_position` is the last (i, j) where `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is the last (i, j) where `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `moves` list is printed, we break out of the print statement.**
