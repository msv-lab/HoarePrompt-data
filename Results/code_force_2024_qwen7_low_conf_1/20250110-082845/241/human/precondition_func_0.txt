grid is a 2D list of strings representing the grid, where each string contains c characters, and r is the number of rows in the grid. visited is a 2D list of booleans with the same dimensions as grid, indicating whether a pixel has been visited. i1 and j1 are integers representing the coordinates of the pixel to be removed from Amanda's body, and i2 and j2 are integers representing the coordinates of the new pixel to be added to Amanda's body. The coordinates (i1, j1) and (i2, j2) are within the bounds of the grid.
