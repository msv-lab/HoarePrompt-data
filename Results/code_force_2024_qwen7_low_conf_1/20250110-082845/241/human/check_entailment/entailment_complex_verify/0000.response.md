### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given code and the original assessment to determine its correctness.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`)
- **Purpose**: Checks if a new pixel `(i2, j2)` can be added to Amanda's body while maintaining connectivity.
- **Behavior**: 
  - Checks if `(i2, j2)` is within bounds.
  - Ensures `(i2, j2)` is not blocked or already visited.
  - Ensures there are at least two adjacent `'*'` pixels to `(i2, j2)` that are unvisited.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`)
- **Purpose**: Determines if a path exists from the initial position to the final position while maintaining connectivity.
- **Behavior**:
  - Uses BFS to explore the grid.
  - Checks connectivity at each step using `func_1`.
  - Ensures the path maintains connectivity by only considering moves that satisfy the connectivity condition.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`)
- **Purpose**: Reads input and calls `func_2` to determine if Amanda can move from the initial position to the final position.
- **Behavior**:
  - Reads the dimensions and grid configurations.
  - Identifies the initial and final positions.
  - Calls `func_2` to get the sequence of moves.
  - Prints the result based on whether a valid sequence is found.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment

The original assessment correctly identifies that the current implementation does not ensure Amanda's body remains connected during the transformation. However, upon closer inspection, the functions do include checks for connectivity.

#### Key Points Addressed by the Functions:
1. **func_1** ensures that adding a new pixel maintains at least two adjacent `'*'` pixels, which guarantees connectivity.
2. **func_2** uses BFS to find a path while calling `func_1` at each step to ensure connectivity.

Given these points, the code does ensure that Amanda's body remains connected during the transformation process. The BFS approach inherently considers connectivity, and `func_1` ensures that any proposed move maintains the necessary connectivity.

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not handle the requirement of maintaining connectivity. The provided code does indeed ensure that Amanda's body remains connected throughout the movement process.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
