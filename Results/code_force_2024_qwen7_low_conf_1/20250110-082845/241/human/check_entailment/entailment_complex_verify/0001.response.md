### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task involves verifying whether a series of moves can transform the initial position of an amoeba (represented by asterisks `*`) into a final position on a grid, where each move involves shrinking the amoeba by one pixel and growing it back at a different location, ensuring the body remains connected.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **func_1**: This function checks if a move from `(i1, j1)` to `(i2, j2)` is valid. It ensures the destination pixel is free (`.`) and checks if the new configuration maintains connectivity (at least 2 neighbors).
   - **func_2**: This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from the initial position to the final position. If such a path exists, it returns the sequence of moves.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, identifies the initial and final positions, and uses `func_2` to determine the moves. It handles both success and failure cases appropriately.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: The logic correctly checks for boundary conditions, blocked cells, and connectivity. It ensures the amoeba remains connected post-move.
     - **Boundary Conditions**: The function correctly checks if `(i2, j2)` is within the grid boundaries.
     - **Blocked Cell Check**: The function correctly checks if the destination pixel is not blocked (`*`) and is not already visited.
     - **Connectivity Check**: The function correctly checks if there are at least 2 adjacent pixels that are free and not visited, ensuring connectivity.
   - **func_2**: BFS is used appropriately to explore potential paths. The function constructs a tree of possible moves using `parent` pointers, ensuring the path is valid.
     - **BFS Initialization**: The function initializes the BFS correctly by setting the initial position as visited and pushing it into the queue.
     - **Move Validation**: For each neighboring pixel, the function uses `func_1` to check if the move is valid. If valid, it marks the pixel as visited, adds it to the queue, and records the parent.
     - **Path Construction**: The function constructs the path by backtracking from the final position using the `parent` dictionary.
   - **func_3**: Reads input, identifies the initial and final positions, and uses `func_2` to determine the moves. It handles both success and failure cases appropriately.
     - **Input Reading**: The function correctly reads the dimensions and the grid positions.
     - **Path Determination**: It calls `func_2` and handles the output accordingly.
     - **Output Handling**: It prints "YES" followed by the number of moves and the sequence of moves if a valid path is found. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the detailed analysis and the logical correctness of the functions and their alignment with the problem requirements, the provided solution appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
- The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` handle the problem requirements accurately.
- The BFS approach ensures that the amoeba can move while maintaining connectivity.
- The input and output handling is appropriate.

**Final:** True
