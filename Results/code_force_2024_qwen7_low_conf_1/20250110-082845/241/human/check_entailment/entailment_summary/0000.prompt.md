You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This problem has an attachment. You can use it to simulate and visualize the
movements of the amoeba.

Amoeba Amanda lives inside a rectangular grid of square pixels. Her body
occupies some of these pixels. Other pixels may be either free or blocked.
Amanda moves across the grid using the so-called amoeboid movement. In each
step of such a movement, her body first shrinks by one pixel (one pixel of the
body is removed and becomes free), and then grows at a different place (one
previously-free pixel is added to the body).

To prevent structural damage, Amanda's body always occupies a connected region
of pixels, which means that any pair of pixels forming the body can be
connected by a sequence of adjacent pixels without ever leaving the body. Two
pixels are considered adjacent if they share a common side (each pixel has at
most 4 neighbours). The body remains connected even during the movement,
including the moment after removing a pixel and before adding another one.

Your task is to help Amanda find her way around. Given her initial position
and desired final position, suggest a sequence of valid moves leading from the
former to the latter.

Illustration of sample 1 : The filled shape is the initial position, the
dotted region is the final position.

Input

The first line contains two integers r and c (1\le r,c \le 50 ) — the size of
the rectangular grid in pixels.

The next r lines contain c characters each, describing the initial position of
Amanda. Each of those characters is either a dot \texttt{.} denoting a free
pixel, an asterisk \texttt{*} denoting Amanda's body, or an \texttt{X}
denoting a blocked pixel which may never be occupied.

The next line is empty.

The next r lines describe the desired final position in the same format as the
initial position.

It is guaranteed that:

  * The number of pixels forming Amanda's body is the same in both positions, and it is at least 2. 
  * The body of Amanda is connected in the initial position. 
  * The body of Amanda is connected in the final position. 
  * The blocked pixels do not change between the descriptions of the initial and final position, their placement is exactly the same in both positions. 

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible for Amanda to go from the initial
position to the final one. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

If it is possible, on the next line print one integer m (0\le m\le 10\,000 ) —
the number of moves to execute.

The following m lines must contain four integer coordinates each: i_1 , j_1 ,
i_2 , j_2 (1\le i_1,i_2\le r , 1\le j_1,j_2\le c ). These four coordinates
specify one move, meaning that the pixel at i_1 -th row and j_1 -th column is
first removed from the body. Then, (i_2,j_2) must designate a different
location where one pixel is added.

The sequence should consist only of valid moves and after the last move,
Amanda's body should occupy the desired final position.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Under the assumptions of this problem, it can be proven that if it is possible
for Amanda to go from the initial position to the desired final one, then it
is possible to do it with at most 10\,000 moves.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(grid, r, c, visited, i1, j1, i2, j2):
    if i2 < 0 or i2 >= r or j2 < 0 or (j2 >= c):
        return False

    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a grid represented as a 2D list of strings, the dimensions of the grid, a 2D list indicating visited pixels, and coordinates for removing and adding pixels. It checks if adding a new pixel at `(i2, j2)` to Amanda's body meets certain conditions:

1. The new pixel coordinates `(i2, j2)` must be within the grid boundaries.
2. The new pixel must not be marked as `'*'` or already visited.
3. At least two adjacent pixels to `(i2, j2)` must also be marked as `'*'` and unvisited.

If all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the new pixel coordinates `(i2, j2)` are out of grid boundaries, the function returns `False`.
- If the new pixel is already marked as `'*'` or visited, the function returns `False`.
- If fewer than two adjacent pixels to `(i2, j2)` are marked as `'*'` and unvisited, the function returns `False`.

The function does not perform any modifications to the grid or visited status; it only checks the conditions and returns a boolean value based on those checks.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position):
    visited = [[False] * c for _ in range(r)]
    q = deque()
    q.append(initial_position)

    parent = {}
    while q:
        current_position = q.popleft()
        if current_position == final_position:
            break

            (ni, nj) = (i + di, j + dj)
            if func_1(grid, r, c, visited, i, j, ni, nj):
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                q.append((ni, nj))
                parent[ni, nj] = (i, j)
    if final_position not in parent:
        return None
    moves = []
    current_position = final_position
    while current_position != initial_position:
        parent_position = parent[current_position]
        moves.append((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))
        current_position = parent_position
    moves.reverse()
    return moves
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a 2D list of strings `grid`, two positive integers `r` and `c` representing the dimensions of the grid, and two tuples `initial_position` and `final_position` representing Amanda's starting and desired final positions. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find a path from `initial_position` to `final_position` in the grid. If such a path exists, it returns a list of tuples, each representing a move Amanda made from `initial_position` to `final_position` but in reverse order. If no path exists, it returns `None`.

The function first initializes a `visited` 2D list to keep track of visited cells, a queue `q` to manage the BFS traversal, and a `parent` dictionary to store the parent positions of each cell in the path. It then performs a BFS traversal from `initial_position`. During the traversal, it checks if the current cell is the `final_position`. If it finds a valid path to the `final_position`, it constructs a list of moves by backtracking through the `parent` dictionary. Finally, it reverses the list of moves and returns it. If no path is found, it returns `None`.

Potential edge cases include:
1. The `initial_position` and `final_position` being the same, in which case the function should return an empty list or `None` depending on the design.
2. The grid being empty or invalid (e.g., non-rectangular).
3. Cells that are not traversable (e.g., obstacles represented by specific characters in the grid).

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the grid contains obstacles or walls that Amanda cannot pass through. This could be added by modifying the `func_1` function to check for obstacles before allowing movement to adjacent cells.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    (r, c) = map(int, input().split())
    initial_grid = [input() for _ in range(r)]
    input()

    initial_position = None
    final_position = None
    for i in range(r):
        for j in range(c):
            if initial_grid[i][j] == '*':
                initial_position = (i, j)
            if final_grid[i][j] == '*':
                final_position = (i, j)
    moves = func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)
    if moves:
        print('YES')
        print(len(moves))
        for move in moves:
            print(*move)
    else:
        print('NO')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads the dimensions of two 2D grids (`r` and `c`), along with their contents (`initial_grid` and `final_grid`), and the coordinates of Amanda's initial and final positions. It then calls another function `func_2` to determine if it's possible to transform `initial_grid` into `final_grid` by moving Amanda's body. If such a transformation is possible, the function prints "YES", the number of moves required, and the sequence of moves. If no transformation is possible, it prints "NO". The function handles edge cases where `r` and `c` are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50). Potential edge cases include invalid grid inputs (e.g., non-square grids, invalid characters) which are not explicitly handled in the given code, and the possibility that Amanda's body might not be connected or have the same number of pixels in both positions, which is also not checked.
