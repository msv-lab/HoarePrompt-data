Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if adding a new pixel at `(i2, j2)` to Amanda's body is valid based on the provided conditions. It ensures that the pixel is within the grid, not already part of Amanda's body, and that it has at least two adjacent pixels also part of the body. This function correctly enforces the rules for adding pixels to Amanda's body.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a sequence of valid moves to transform the initial grid into the final grid. It uses `func_1` to validate each potential move and constructs a path from the initial position to the final position. If such a path exists, it correctly returns the sequence of moves. However, there is a missing functionality check for whether the bodies are connected and have the same number of pixels, which is essential to ensure the correctness of the solution.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input and calls `func_2` to determine if the transformation is possible. It then prints the appropriate output based on the result. However, `func_3` does not explicitly check if the initial and final positions have the same number of pixels and are connected. This is a critical check that should be performed to ensure the correctness of the solution.

Given the problem statement, it is necessary to ensure that:
- The initial and final positions have the same number of pixels.
- Both positions are connected.
- No obstacles are bypassed without proper validation.

Since `func_3` does not perform these checks, the solution is not fully correct as stated.

Correctness: **False**
