### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - Amanda's body must remain connected at all times.
   - The body must be connected before and after each move.
   - The function `func_1` checks if a move is valid by ensuring the new pixel to be added (`(i2, j2)`) is within bounds, not blocked, and has at least two adjacent pixels that are part of Amanda's body.
   - The function `func_2` uses BFS to find a path from the initial position to the final position, ensuring connectivity at each step.

2. **Analysis of Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function checks if a move is valid by verifying the new pixel to be added is within bounds, not blocked, and has at least two adjacent pixels that are part of Amanda's body.
     - This ensures that the new pixel addition maintains connectivity.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function uses BFS to explore all possible paths from the initial position to the final position.
     - For each step, it calls `func_1` to ensure the move is valid, thus maintaining connectivity.
     - The BFS traversal ensures that Amanda's body remains connected throughout the transformation process.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that `func_1` is called to validate each move before it is added to the queue, ensuring connectivity is maintained.
   - The BFS approach guarantees that all intermediate states are valid and connected, adhering to the problem requirements.

Given this analysis, the program correctly handles the requirement that Amanda's body must remain connected throughout the entire movement process. The original assessment incorrectly identified a flaw that does not exist in the provided solution.

### Conclusion:

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the annotations provided.
