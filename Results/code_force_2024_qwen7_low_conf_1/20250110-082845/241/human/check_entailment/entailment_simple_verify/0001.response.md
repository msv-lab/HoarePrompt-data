### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task involves verifying whether a series of moves can transform the initial position of an amoeba (represented by asterisks `*`) into a final position on a grid, where each move involves shrinking the amoeba by one pixel and growing it back at a different location, ensuring the body remains connected.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **func_1**: This function checks if a move from `(i1, j1)` to `(i2, j2)` is valid. It ensures the destination pixel is free (`.`) and checks if the new configuration maintains connectivity (at least 2 neighbors).
   - **func_2**: This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from the initial position to the final position. If such a path exists, it returns the sequence of moves.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: The logic correctly checks for boundary conditions, blocked cells, and connectivity. It ensures the amoeba remains connected post-move.
   - **func_2**: BFS is used appropriately to explore potential paths. The function constructs a tree of possible moves using `parent` pointers, ensuring the path is valid.
   - **func_3**: Reads input, identifies the initial and final positions, and uses `func_2` to determine the moves. It handles both success and failure cases appropriately.

#### Detailed Analysis:

- **func_1**:
  - **Boundary Check**: The function correctly checks if `(i2, j2)` is within the grid boundaries.
  - **Blocked Cell Check**: It ensures the target cell is not blocked (`*`).
  - **Connectivity Check**: It verifies if the target cell has at least 2 neighboring pixels that are part of the amoeba (`*`). This ensures the amoeba remains connected after the move.
  - **Return Value**: Returns `False` if any condition fails, otherwise returns `True`.

- **func_2**:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Uses BFS to explore all possible moves from the initial position.
  - **Parent Dictionary**: Keeps track of the parent node for each position, allowing the construction of the path back to the initial position.
  - **Path Construction**: If a path is found, it reconstructs the sequence of moves using the `parent` dictionary.
  - **Return Value**: Returns a list of moves if a valid path is found, otherwise returns `None`.

- **func_3**:
  - **Input Reading**: Correctly reads the initial and final grid configurations.
  - **Position Identification**: Identifies the initial and final positions of the amoeba.
  - **Move Calculation**: Calls `func_2` to get the sequence of moves.
  - **Output Handling**: Prints "YES" and the sequence of moves if a valid path is found, otherwise prints "NO".

#### Systematic Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**:
  - `grid` is a 2D list of strings representing the grid.
  - `visited` is a 2D list of booleans indicating visited cells.
  - `initial_position` and `final_position` are the starting and ending positions of the amoeba.

- **func_1**:
  - **State After Boundary Check**: Ensures `(i2, j2)` is within bounds.
  - **State After Blocked Check**: Ensures the target cell is not blocked.
  - **State After Connectivity Check**: Ensures the target cell has at least 2 neighboring amoeba cells.

- **func_2**:
  - **State After BFS Initialization**: Initializes the queue and marks the initial position as visited.
  - **State After Path Exploration**: Uses BFS to explore all possible moves and updates the `parent` dictionary.
  - **State After Path Reconstruction**: Reconstructs the path from `final_position` to `initial_position` using the `parent` dictionary.

- **func_3**:
  - **State After Input Reading**: Reads the initial and final grid configurations.
  - **State After Position Identification**: Identifies the initial and final positions of the amoeba.
  - **State After Move Calculation**: Calls `func_2` to get the sequence of moves.
  - **State After Output Handling**: Prints the result based on whether a valid path was found.
