You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: This problem has an attachment. You can use it to simulate and visualize the
movements of the amoeba.

Amoeba Amanda lives inside a rectangular grid of square pixels. Her body
occupies some of these pixels. Other pixels may be either free or blocked.
Amanda moves across the grid using the so-called amoeboid movement. In each
step of such a movement, her body first shrinks by one pixel (one pixel of the
body is removed and becomes free), and then grows at a different place (one
previously-free pixel is added to the body).

To prevent structural damage, Amanda's body always occupies a connected region
of pixels, which means that any pair of pixels forming the body can be
connected by a sequence of adjacent pixels without ever leaving the body. Two
pixels are considered adjacent if they share a common side (each pixel has at
most 4 neighbours). The body remains connected even during the movement,
including the moment after removing a pixel and before adding another one.

Your task is to help Amanda find her way around. Given her initial position
and desired final position, suggest a sequence of valid moves leading from the
former to the latter.

Illustration of sample 1 : The filled shape is the initial position, the
dotted region is the final position.

Input

The first line contains two integers r and c (1\le r,c \le 50 ) — the size of
the rectangular grid in pixels.

The next r lines contain c characters each, describing the initial position of
Amanda. Each of those characters is either a dot \texttt{.} denoting a free
pixel, an asterisk \texttt{*} denoting Amanda's body, or an \texttt{X}
denoting a blocked pixel which may never be occupied.

The next line is empty.

The next r lines describe the desired final position in the same format as the
initial position.

It is guaranteed that:

  * The number of pixels forming Amanda's body is the same in both positions, and it is at least 2. 
  * The body of Amanda is connected in the initial position. 
  * The body of Amanda is connected in the final position. 
  * The blocked pixels do not change between the descriptions of the initial and final position, their placement is exactly the same in both positions. 

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible for Amanda to go from the initial
position to the final one. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

If it is possible, on the next line print one integer m (0\le m\le 10\,000 ) —
the number of moves to execute.

The following m lines must contain four integer coordinates each: i_1 , j_1 ,
i_2 , j_2 (1\le i_1,i_2\le r , 1\le j_1,j_2\le c ). These four coordinates
specify one move, meaning that the pixel at i_1 -th row and j_1 -th column is
first removed from the body. Then, (i_2,j_2) must designate a different
location where one pixel is added.

The sequence should consist only of valid moves and after the last move,
Amanda's body should occupy the desired final position.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Under the assumptions of this problem, it can be proven that if it is possible
for Amanda to go from the initial position to the desired final one, then it
is possible to do it with at most 10\,000 moves.

shown in the figure below.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
