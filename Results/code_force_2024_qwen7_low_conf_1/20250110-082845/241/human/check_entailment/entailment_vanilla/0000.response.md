Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task involves verifying whether a series of moves can transform the initial position of an amoeba (represented by asterisks `*`) into a final position on a grid, where each move involves shrinking the amoeba by one pixel and growing it back at a different location, ensuring the body remains connected.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **func_1**: This function checks if a move from `(i1, j1)` to `(i2, j2)` is valid. It ensures the destination pixel is free (`.`) and checks if the new configuration maintains connectivity (at least 2 neighbors).
   - **func_2**: This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from the initial position to the final position. If such a path exists, it returns the sequence of moves.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: The logic correctly checks for boundary conditions, blocked cells, and connectivity. It ensures the amoeba remains connected post-move.
   - **func_2**: BFS is used appropriately to explore potential paths. The function constructs a tree of possible moves using `parent` pointers, ensuring the path is valid.
   - **func_3**: Reads input, identifies the initial and final positions, and uses `func_2` to determine the moves. It handles both success and failure cases appropriately.

Given the logical correctness of the functions and their alignment with the problem requirements, the provided solution appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
