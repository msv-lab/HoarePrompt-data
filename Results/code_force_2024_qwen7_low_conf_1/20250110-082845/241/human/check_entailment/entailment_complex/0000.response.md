Reasoning:  
The given program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. Let's analyze each function to ensure they collectively solve the problem correctly.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a move from `(i1, j1)` to `(i2, j2)` is valid. It ensures that the move maintains the connectivity of Amanda's body by checking if the new pixel `(i2, j2)` is within bounds, not already part of the body or visited, and has at least two unvisited neighboring pixels. This function correctly enforces the rules of movement and ensures that the body remains connected.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from Amanda's initial position to her final position. It correctly marks visited positions, updates the parent of each visited position, and constructs the sequence of moves by backtracking through the parent dictionary. If a valid path is found, it returns the sequence of moves. If no path is found, it returns `None`.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input, determines Amanda's initial and final positions, and calls `func_2` to find a path. If a path is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number of moves and the sequence of moves. If no path is found, it prints "NO". This function correctly processes the input and outputs the expected result based on the outcome of `func_2`.

Each function works as intended and collectively, they solve the problem correctly. The overall logic and implementation of the functions align with the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
