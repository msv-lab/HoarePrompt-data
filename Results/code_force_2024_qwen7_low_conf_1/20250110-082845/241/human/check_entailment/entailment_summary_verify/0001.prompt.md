You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This problem has an attachment. You can use it to simulate and visualize the
movements of the amoeba.

Amoeba Amanda lives inside a rectangular grid of square pixels. Her body
occupies some of these pixels. Other pixels may be either free or blocked.
Amanda moves across the grid using the so-called amoeboid movement. In each
step of such a movement, her body first shrinks by one pixel (one pixel of the
body is removed and becomes free), and then grows at a different place (one
previously-free pixel is added to the body).

To prevent structural damage, Amanda's body always occupies a connected region
of pixels, which means that any pair of pixels forming the body can be
connected by a sequence of adjacent pixels without ever leaving the body. Two
pixels are considered adjacent if they share a common side (each pixel has at
most 4 neighbours). The body remains connected even during the movement,
including the moment after removing a pixel and before adding another one.

Your task is to help Amanda find her way around. Given her initial position
and desired final position, suggest a sequence of valid moves leading from the
former to the latter.

Illustration of sample 1 : The filled shape is the initial position, the
dotted region is the final position.

Input

The first line contains two integers r and c (1\le r,c \le 50 ) — the size of
the rectangular grid in pixels.

The next r lines contain c characters each, describing the initial position of
Amanda. Each of those characters is either a dot \texttt{.} denoting a free
pixel, an asterisk \texttt{*} denoting Amanda's body, or an \texttt{X}
denoting a blocked pixel which may never be occupied.

The next line is empty.

The next r lines describe the desired final position in the same format as the
initial position.

It is guaranteed that:

  * The number of pixels forming Amanda's body is the same in both positions, and it is at least 2. 
  * The body of Amanda is connected in the initial position. 
  * The body of Amanda is connected in the final position. 
  * The blocked pixels do not change between the descriptions of the initial and final position, their placement is exactly the same in both positions. 

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible for Amanda to go from the initial
position to the final one. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

If it is possible, on the next line print one integer m (0\le m\le 10\,000 ) —
the number of moves to execute.

The following m lines must contain four integer coordinates each: i_1 , j_1 ,
i_2 , j_2 (1\le i_1,i_2\le r , 1\le j_1,j_2\le c ). These four coordinates
specify one move, meaning that the pixel at i_1 -th row and j_1 -th column is
first removed from the body. Then, (i_2,j_2) must designate a different
location where one pixel is added.

The sequence should consist only of valid moves and after the last move,
Amanda's body should occupy the desired final position.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Under the assumptions of this problem, it can be proven that if it is possible
for Amanda to go from the initial position to the desired final one, then it
is possible to do it with at most 10\,000 moves.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` reads the dimensions of two 2D grids (`r` and `c`), along with their contents (`initial_grid` and `final_grid`), and the coordinates of Amanda's initial and final positions. It then calls another function `func_2` to determine if it's possible to transform `initial_grid` into `final_grid` by moving Amanda's body. If such a transformation is possible, the function prints "YES", the number of moves required, and the sequence of moves. If no transformation is possible, it prints "NO". The function handles edge cases where `r` and `c` are within the specified bounds (1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50). Potential edge cases include invalid grid inputs (e.g., non-square grids, invalid characters) which are not explicitly handled in the given code, and the possibility that Amanda's body might not be connected or have the same number of pixels in both positions, which is also not checked.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task involves verifying whether a series of moves can transform the initial position of an amoeba (represented by asterisks `*`) into a final position on a grid, where each move involves shrinking the amoeba by one pixel and growing it back at a different location, ensuring the body remains connected.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **func_1**: This function checks if a move from `(i1, j1)` to `(i2, j2)` is valid. It ensures the destination pixel is free (`.`) and checks if the new configuration maintains connectivity (at least 2 neighbors).
   - **func_2**: This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from the initial position to the final position. If such a path exists, it returns the sequence of moves.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: The logic correctly checks for boundary conditions, blocked cells, and connectivity. It ensures the amoeba remains connected post-move.
   - **func_2**: BFS is used appropriately to explore potential paths. The function constructs a tree of possible moves using `parent` pointers, ensuring the path is valid.
   - **func_3**: Reads input, identifies the initial and final positions, and uses `func_2` to determine the moves. It handles both success and failure cases appropriately.

Given the logical correctness of the functions and their alignment with the problem requirements, the provided solution appears to be correct.
