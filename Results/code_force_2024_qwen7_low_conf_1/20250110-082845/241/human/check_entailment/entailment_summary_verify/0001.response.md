### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to verify if a series of moves can transform the initial position of an amoeba into a final position on a grid, maintaining the connectivity of the amoeba at all times.
   - Each move involves shrinking the amoeba by one pixel and growing it back at a different location, ensuring the body remains connected.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **func_1**: Checks if a move from `(i1, j1)` to `(i2, j2)` is valid.
     - Ensures the destination pixel is free.
     - Checks if the new configuration maintains connectivity (at least 2 neighbors).
   - **func_2**: Uses BFS to find a path from the initial position to the final position.
     - Constructs a tree of possible moves using `parent` pointers.
   - **func_3**: Reads the input, identifies the initial and final positions, and uses `func_2` to determine the moves.
     - Handles both success and failure cases appropriately.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: The function correctly checks for boundary conditions, blocked cells, and connectivity. It ensures the amoeba remains connected post-move.
   - **func_2**: BFS is used appropriately to explore potential paths. The function constructs a tree of possible moves using `parent` pointers, ensuring the path is valid.
   - **func_3**: Reads input, identifies the initial and final positions, and uses `func_2` to determine the moves. It handles both success and failure cases appropriately.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - **func_1** assumes that the grid is always well-formed and the input is valid. However, the problem statement guarantees that the grid is valid, so this assumption is safe.
   - **func_2** uses BFS to find a path but does not explicitly check if the initial and final configurations of the amoeba are connected. While the problem guarantees that both positions are connected, the function should still ensure this condition holds.
   - **func_3** correctly handles the input and calls `func_2` appropriately. However, it does not explicitly check the validity of the input grids beyond ensuring they are within the specified bounds.

### Evaluation:

- **func_1**: Correctly checks for valid moves and connectivity.
- **func_2**: Correctly finds a path using BFS and constructs the sequence of moves.
- **func_3**: Reads input and calls `func_2` appropriately, handling success and failure cases.

Given the logical correctness of the functions and their alignment with the problem requirements, the provided solution appears to be correct. The functions handle the core requirements of the problem, although there could be minor improvements in terms of explicit validation of the initial and final grid configurations' connectivity.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
