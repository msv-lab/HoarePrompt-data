#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the indices of the two magic words chosen by a student, such that 1 <= a, b <= n and a and b are valid indices of the magic words previously printed by the program.
def func_1(a, b):
    return (a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1 if a >= b else (a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1
    #The program returns ((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1) if a is greater than or equal to b, otherwise it returns ((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, which represent the indices of magic words with the constraint that 1 <= a, b <= n and are valid indices previously printed by the program. After executing, the function returns a calculated value based on the given conditions. Specifically, if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it returns the value `((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1)`. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns the value `((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1)`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond the given conditions. The function does not modify any external state and only uses the input parameters `a` and `b` to compute its output.
