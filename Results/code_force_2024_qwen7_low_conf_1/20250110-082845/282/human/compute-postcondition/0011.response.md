The code `concatenated = words[i] + words[j]` updates the value of `concatenated` to be the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`. The values of `n`, `power`, and `powers[power]` are not directly affected by this line of code. The only change is to the `concatenated` variable.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `n` must be at least 1, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power] = i + 1, (j + 1) + 1`**
