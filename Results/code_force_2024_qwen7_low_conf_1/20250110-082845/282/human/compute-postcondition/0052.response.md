The code snippet prints the values of `u` and `v`. Since `u` and `v` are indices within the tuple `powers[p]`, and `print(u, v)` simply outputs these values without changing them, the values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged after the print statement. The output of the print statement is `u` followed by `v`.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the result of concatenating every pair of strings in `words` in a specific order, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring where `i` and `j` are the indices of the strings in `words`, `u` is the first index of the tuple `powers[p]`, `v` is the second index of the tuple `powers[p]`, `p` is an input integer, and the output of the print statement is `u` followed by `v`.**
