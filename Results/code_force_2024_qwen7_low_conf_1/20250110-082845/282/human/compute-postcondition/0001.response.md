The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing indices of magic words, with the constraint that 1 <= a, b <= n and are valid indices previously printed by the program. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the function returns ((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1); otherwise, it returns ((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return a calculated value based on the given conditions.
