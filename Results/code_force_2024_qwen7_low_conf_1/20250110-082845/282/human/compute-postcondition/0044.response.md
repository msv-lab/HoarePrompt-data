The code updates the value of `power` by calculating the number of unique substrings in `concatenated`. Given that `concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`, the value of `power` will be the count of unique substrings of `concatenated`.

To find the unique substrings, the code iterates over all possible substrings of `concatenated` using nested loops. For each substring, it adds it to a set, which automatically removes duplicates. The length of this set gives the number of unique substrings.

Let's denote `words[1]` as `a` and `words[j]` as `b`. Thus, `concatenated` is `a + b`.

The number of unique substrings of `a + b` can be calculated as follows:
- If `a` and `b` are distinct, the substrings are all possible combinations of non-empty prefixes of `a` and `b`.
- If `a` and `b` share some common characters, some substrings might be shared, but the set operation ensures only unique substrings are counted.

For simplicity, let's assume `a` and `b` are distinct (the most straightforward case):

- Substrings starting from `a`: `a`, `aa`, ..., `a...a` (length of `a` substrings)
- Substrings starting from `b`: `b`, `bb`, ..., `b...b` (length of `b` substrings)
- All possible combinations of `a` and `b`: `ab`, `aab`, `ba`, `bab`, etc.

Given `a + b`, the total number of unique substrings is the sum of the lengths of `a` and `b` plus one for the empty substring (if considered, though typically not included).

Thus, `power` will be the length of the concatenated string `a + b`.

Since the exact values of `words[1]` and `words[j]` are not provided, we can denote the length of `words[1]` as `len_a` and the length of `words[j]` as `len_b`.

Therefore, the updated value of `power` will be `len_a + len_b`.

Output State: **`concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`, `power` is `len(words[1]) + len(words[j])`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 3)` for the next unique substring, `i` is 1**
