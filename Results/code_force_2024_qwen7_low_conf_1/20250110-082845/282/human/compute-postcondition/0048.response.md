`q` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`concatenated`, `power`, and `powers`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the result of concatenating every pair of strings in `words` in a specific order, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring where `i` and `j` are the indices of the strings in `words`, `q` is an input integer**
