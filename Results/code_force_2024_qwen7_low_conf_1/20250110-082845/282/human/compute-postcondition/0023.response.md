The code snippet tries to assign values to `powers[power]`, but there are a few issues. First, `powers` is not defined in the initial state. Second, `j` is not defined anywhere in the provided code or initial state. Given these conditions, the code cannot be executed as written because of the undefined variables.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that `powers` is a dictionary and `j` is supposed to be `i - 1` (since `i` is initially set to `n` and the list `words` has at least `n` elements, making `i - 1` a valid index).

So, the updated code would look like this:
```python
powers[power] = i + 1, i
```

Let's follow the steps:

1. `powers` is a dictionary (assumed).
2. `power` is undefined, but we will assume it's a key in the dictionary.
3. `i` is `n`.
4. `j` is assumed to be `i - 1`, which is `n - 1`.

Therefore, the code updates the dictionary `powers` with the key `power` and assigns the tuple `(i + 1, i)` to it. Since `i` is `n`, the values are `(n + 1, n)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `words` is a list with at least `n` elements; `i` is `n`; `power` is undefined; `powers[power]` is `(n + 1, n)`**
