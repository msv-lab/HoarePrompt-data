Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[n-1]`
   - `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`
   - `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(n + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring
   - `i` is `n`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, it does not satisfy the condition `i < n` for the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `concatenated` remains the same as no changes occur within the loop body.
   - `power` remains the same as no changes occur within the loop body.
   - `powers[power]` remains the same as no changes occur within the loop body.
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to `0` for the loop to start executing again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[n-1]`, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(n + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring, `i` is `0`**
