First, let's analyze the code snippet:

```python
power = len(set(concatenated[k:l] for k in range(len(concatenated)) for l in
    range(k + 1, len(concatenated) + 1)))
```

This line of code calculates the length of a set of all possible substrings from the `concatenated` string. The `set` function ensures that all substrings are unique.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `words` is a list with at least `n` elements.
- `i` is `n`.
- `power` is `len(words[n]) + len(words[0])`.
- `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[1]`.
- `j` is `1`.
- `powers[power]` is `n + 1`.
- `powers` at index `1` is `1`.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[1]`. Let's denote this concatenated string as `str_concat`.
2. The set of all substrings of `str_concat` is generated using nested loops. For each substring `str_concat[k:l]` where `k` ranges from `0` to `len(str_concat) - 1` and `l` ranges from `k + 1` to `len(str_concat)`.

Since the set of substrings will include all possible substrings of `str_concat`, the number of unique substrings will be the number of substrings that can be formed from a string of length `len(concatenated)`. The formula for the number of substrings of a string of length `m` is given by:

\[ \text{Number of substrings} = \frac{m(m + 1)}{2} \]

Here, `len(concatenated)` is `len(words[n]) + len(words[1])`, so let's denote `len(concatenated)` as `m`.

Thus, the new value of `power` is:

\[ \text{power} = \frac{m(m + 1)}{2} \]

Where \( m = \text{len(words[n])} + \text{len(words[1])} \).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `words` is a list with at least `n` elements; `i` is `n`; `power` is \(\frac{\text{len(words[n])} + \text{len(words[1])}}{2} (\text{len(words[n])} + \text{len(words[1])} + 1)\); `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[1]`; `j` is `1`; `powers[power]` is `n + 1`; `powers` at index `1` is `1`.**
