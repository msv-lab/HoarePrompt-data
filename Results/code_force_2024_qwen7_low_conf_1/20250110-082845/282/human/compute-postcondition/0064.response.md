Output State: **`concatenated` is the result of concatenating every pair of strings in `words` in a specific order, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring where `i` and `j` are the indices of the strings in `words`, the loop has executed `q` times, and for each iteration, `p` is an integer entered by the user, `u` is the first index of the tuple `powers[p]`, `v` is the second index of the tuple `powers[p]`, and the output buffer is flushed with `u` followed by `v` for each iteration.**
