According to the given for loop statement, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. The loop starts with `j` being 0 and increments `j` until `j` is no longer less than `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` would otherwise be empty if `n` were 0).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 1**
