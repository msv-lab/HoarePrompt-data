Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information
- `concatenated` is the final concatenated string formed by concatenating all `words[j]` for `j` in `range(n)`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`.
- `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring where `i` is the index of the word in `words` and `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
- `i` is set to `n` before the loop starts.

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `n` before the loop starts.
   - Since the loop iterates over `j` in `range(n)`, the value of `i` should remain consistent with the loop variable `j` to avoid any conflict or unexpected behavior.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is a positive integer, which means the loop can execute as long as `n > 0`.

3. **Variable `power`:**
   - `power` is the number of unique substrings in `concatenated`. This is relevant for determining the size of `powers[power]`, but not directly for the loop to execute.

4. **Loop Variable `j`:**
   - The loop variable `j` will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

5. **List `words`:**
   - Although `words` is mentioned, the initial state of `words` is not directly specified. However, since the loop depends on `n`, which is the length of `words`, we need to ensure `words` is a non-empty list of words (i.e., its length is `n`).

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes correctly, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `n` must be a positive integer (`n > 0`).
- `words` must be a list with at least `n` elements (i.e., `len(words) == n`).
- `i` is already set to `n` and does not need adjustment within the context of the loop itself.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be a positive integer (`n > 0`), `words` is a list with at least `n` elements (`len(words) == n`), `i` is `n`**
