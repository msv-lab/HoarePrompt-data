The code assigns the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to `powers[power]`. The variables `concatenated`, `n`, and `power` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `n` must be at least 1, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1`**
