`p` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The value of `p` is determined by user input, and this input is converted to an integer. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the result of concatenating every pair of strings in `words` in a specific order, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring where `i` and `j` are the indices of the strings in `words`, `u` is the first index of the tuple `powers[p]`, `v` is the second index of the tuple `powers[p]`, `p` is an integer input from the user, and the output of the print statement is `u` followed by `v`. The output buffer is flushed immediately, and the loop counter `_` is `q`.**
