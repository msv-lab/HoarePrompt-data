The given code initializes an empty dictionary named `powers`. The initial values of `n` and `words` remain unchanged, and no operations are performed on them within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the empty dictionary `powers`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `words` is a list of strings where each string is of the form `'X' * i + 'O' * (i % 2)' for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`; `powers` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**
