The code snippet tries to concatenate the `i-th` and `j-th` elements of the `words` list. However, there is an issue with the indices used: `i` is set to `n`, which is out of bounds since `len(words) == n`. This means that `words[i]` will raise an `IndexError` because `i` is not a valid index for the list.

Since the code cannot be executed due to an error, the variables `n`, `words`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `words` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n`**
