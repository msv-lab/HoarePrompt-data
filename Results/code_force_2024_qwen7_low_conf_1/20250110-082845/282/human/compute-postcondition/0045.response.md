The code updates the value in the dictionary `powers` for the key `power`. Specifically, it assigns a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `powers[power]`. Given the initial state:

- `concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`
- `power` is `len(words[1]) + len(words[j])`
- `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 3)`
- `i` is 1

After executing the line `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1`, the dictionary entry for `power` will now contain the tuple `(1 + 1, j + 1)`, which simplifies to `(2, j + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`, `power` is `len(words[1]) + len(words[j])`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(2, j + 1)`, `i` is 1**
