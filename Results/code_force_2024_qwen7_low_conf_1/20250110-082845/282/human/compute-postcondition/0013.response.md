The code updates the value of `powers[power]` from `(i + 1), (j + 2)` to `i + 1, j + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- The value of `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`.
- The value of `n` is at least 1.
- The value of `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`.
- The original value of `powers[power]` was `(i + 1), (j + 2)`.
- After the code runs, the value of `powers[power]` is updated to `i + 1, j + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `n` is at least 1, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1`**
