Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of magic words (with 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and generates a list of `n` magic words. Each word is constructed by repeating 'X' a certain number of times and then 'O' a number of times based on the index modulo 2. After printing the list of words, the function calculates the power of each possible concatenation of these words. The power is defined as the number of unique substrings in the concatenated string. For each query `p_j` (an integer), the function retrieves the indices of the two words used to form a concatenation with the specified power and prints these indices. The function handles up to 1000 queries.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, there are no pairs of words to concatenate, so the function will only print one word and handle up to 1000 queries for this single word.
- If no pair of words has a concatenation with the specified power, the function will print nothing for that query.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate if the input `n` is within the allowed range (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). This should be added to ensure the function behaves correctly.
- The function does not provide any feedback if a query `p_j` does not have a corresponding pair of words. This could be handled by checking if `powers[p]` is in the dictionary before attempting to retrieve indices and print them.
