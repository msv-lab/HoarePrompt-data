The code `concatenated = words[i] + words[j]` updates the value of the variable `concatenated` to be the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `power`, `powers`, `i`, and `j`.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `n` is at least 1, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 2`**
