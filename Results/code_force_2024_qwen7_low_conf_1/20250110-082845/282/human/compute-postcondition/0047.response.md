Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step to determine the final state after the loop completes all its iterations.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `words` is a list of strings where each string is of the form `'X' * i + 'O' * (i % 2)` for each integer \(i\) from 1 to \(n\).
- `powers` is an empty dictionary `{}`.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        concatenated = words[i] + words[j]
        power = len(set(concatenated[k:l] for k in range(len(concatenated)) for l in range(k + 1, len(concatenated) + 1)))
        powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Concatenation**:
   - The inner loop concatenates every pair of strings in `words` and stores the result in `concatenated`.
   - For each pair \((words[i], words[j])\), the concatenated string is formed and its length is computed.

2. **Power Calculation**:
   - The power of a string is defined as the number of unique substrings of the concatenated string.
   - This is calculated using the set comprehension, which collects all possible substrings of `concatenated`.

3. **Dictionary Update**:
   - The power value is used as a key in the `powers` dictionary, and the corresponding value is a tuple of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` indicating the positions of the strings in the `words` list.

### Final Iterations and State
- The loop will execute for every pair \((i, j)\) where \(0 \leq i, j < n\).
- Therefore, the final state will be the result of concatenating all pairs of strings in `words` and calculating the power based on the resulting concatenated string.

### Final Output State

- After the loop completes, the `concatenated` string will be the result of concatenating all pairs of strings in `words` in a specific order.
- The `power` will be the number of unique substrings of this concatenated string.
- The `powers` dictionary will map each unique power value to the indices of the pairs of strings that produced that power.

### Output State:
Output State: **`concatenated` is the result of concatenating every pair of strings in `words` in a specific order, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring where `i` and `j` are the indices of the strings in `words`.**
