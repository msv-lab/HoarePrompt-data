The code calculates the new value of `power` by determining the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`. The value of `power` is updated to this new count. All other variables remain unchanged.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process:

1. The code creates a set of all possible substrings of `concatenated` using nested loops.
2. The length of this set gives the number of unique substrings.
3. The value of `power` is then set to this length.

Therefore, the variable `power` is updated to the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, while the other variables remain as they were.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `n` is at least 1, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 2` and `power` is updated to the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`.**
