According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `words` is a list with at least `n` elements.
- `i` is `n`.
- `power` is undefined.
- `powers[power]` is `(n + 1, n)`.

Since `i` is `n` and the loop iterates over `range(n)`, at the start of the current iteration, `j` is `i` which is `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. However, since `j` starts at `n` and increments by 1 each iteration, the first iteration where `j` would be less than `n` would require `j` to be `0`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is `0` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `words` is a list with at least `n` elements; `i` is `n`; `power` is undefined; `powers[power]` is `(n + 1, n); j is 0`**
