Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `concatenated` is the final concatenated string formed by concatenating all `words[j]` for `j` in `range(n)`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`.
   - `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring where `i` is the index of the word in `words` and `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` in `range(n)`, meaning `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than `n` (since it ranged from `0` to `n-1`).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`, which means `i` will now be `n - 1 + 1 = n`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `concatenated`, `n`, `power`, and `powers` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`concatenated` is the final concatenated string formed by concatenating all `words[j]` for `j` in `range(n)`, `n` is a positive integer, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring where `i` is the index of the word in `words` and `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `n`**
