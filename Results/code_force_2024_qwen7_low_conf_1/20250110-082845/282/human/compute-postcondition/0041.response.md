The code updates the value of `powers[power]` to be a tuple containing `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given the initial state:

- `concatenated` is `words[0] + words[j + 1]`
- `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`
- `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 2)` for each unique substring
- `i` is 0

After the code execution:

- The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`, which is `0 + 1` or `1`.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged.
- The value of `powers[power]` is updated to be a tuple `(1, j + 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`concatenated` is `words[0] + words[j + 1]`, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 2)` for each unique substring, `i` is 1, `powers[power]` is `(1, j + 1)`**
