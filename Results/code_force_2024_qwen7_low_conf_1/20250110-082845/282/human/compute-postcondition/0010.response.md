Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: 
   - `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`.
   - `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution Context**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been the value it ended on, and the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine Next State**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must still be within the range `0` to `n-1`, which means `j + 1 < n` or equivalently `j < n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `concatenated` remains the same as it does not depend on `j` in this loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `power` remains the same as it does not depend on `j` in this loop.
   - `powers[power]` will be updated to include `i + 1, (j + 1) + 1` when the loop executes again.

Given that the loop will continue as long as `j < n - 1`, we need to update `j` to `j + 1`.

**Final State**:
- `concatenated` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `power` remains unchanged.
- `j` will be `j + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `n` must be at least 1, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power] = i + 1, (j + 1) + 1`**
