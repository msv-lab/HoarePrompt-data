Output State: **`concatenated` is the final concatenated string formed by concatenating all `words[j]` for `j` in `range(n)`, `n` is a positive integer, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring where `i` is the index of the word in `words` and `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`**, provided that the loop executes at least once. If `n` is 0, then the loop does not execute, `concatenated` remains an empty string, `power` is 0, and `powers` remains empty.

### Explanation:
1. **Concatenated String**: The loop iterates over each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, concatenating `words[i]` and `words[j]` to form `concatenated`. Since `i` is fixed and the loop iterates `n` times, the final value of `concatenated` will be the concatenation of `words[0]` and `words[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Power Calculation**: For each iteration, `power` is calculated as the number of unique substrings of the current `concatenated`. This means `power` will store the count of unique substrings in the final concatenated string.

3. **Powers Dictionary**: `powers[power]` is updated with the indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring found during the iterations. The `+1` is because the indices start from `0` in the original list, but the dictionary keys are adjusted to start from `1`.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, resulting in `concatenated` being an empty string, `power` being 0, and `powers` remaining empty.

Thus, after the loop has finished executing all iterations, the final state of the variables will reflect the concatenation of all relevant strings and the calculation of unique substrings as described.
