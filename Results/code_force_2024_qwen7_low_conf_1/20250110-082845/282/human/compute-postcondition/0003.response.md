The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `n` or `words`. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the standard output device. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables themselves.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `words` is a list of strings where each string is of the form `'X' * i + 'O' * (i % 2)' for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`.**
