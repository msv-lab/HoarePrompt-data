The code `concatenated = words[i] + words[j]` concatenates the string at index `i` in the list `words` with the string at index `j` in the list `words`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is `0`. Therefore, `words[i]` refers to `words[n]` and `words[j]` refers to `words[0]`.

After executing the code, the value of `concatenated` will be the concatenation of `words[n]` and `words[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `words` is a list with at least `n` elements; `i` is `n`; `power` is undefined; `powers[power]` is `(n + 1, n); `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0]; `j is 0**
