The code updates the value of `powers[power]` from `i + 1, j + 2` to `i + 1, j + 1`. This means that the tuple stored in `powers[power]` is now `i + 1, j + 1` instead of `i + 1, j + 2`.

The initial state is:
- `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`
- `n` is at least 1
- `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`
- `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 2`
- `power` is updated to the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`

After executing the line of code, the new state will be:
- `concatenated` remains the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`
- `n` remains at least 1
- `power` remains the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`
- `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `n` is at least 1, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1`, and `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`**.
