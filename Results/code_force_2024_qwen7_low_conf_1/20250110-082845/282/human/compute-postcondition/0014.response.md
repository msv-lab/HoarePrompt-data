According to the given for loop statement, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `powers[power]` has been updated to `i + 1, j + 1`, and the value of `j` is `j + 2` based on the previous update rule.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Value of `j`:** Since `j` was incremented by 2 in the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1`.
2. **Value of `powers[power]`:** The value of `powers[power]` will be updated again in the next iteration. The new value will be `i + 1, j + 2`.

Given this information, let's adjust the states:

- `concatenated` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains at least 1.
- `power` remains the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`.
- `powers[power]` will be updated to `i + 1, j + 2`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `n` is at least 1, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 2`**
