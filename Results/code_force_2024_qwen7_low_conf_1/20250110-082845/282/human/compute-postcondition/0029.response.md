Step 1: The initial state is given as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `words` is a list with at least `n` elements
- `i` is `n`
- `power` is `len(words[n]) + len(words[0])`
- `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0]`
- `j` is `1`
- `powers[power]` is `n + 1`
- `powers` at index `1` is `1`

Step 2: The code snippet is:
```python
concatenated = words[i] + words[j]
```

Step 3: The value of `i` is `n`, and the value of `j` is `1`. Therefore, `words[i]` is `words[n]` and `words[j]` is `words[1]`.

Step 4: After executing the code, the variable `concatenated` will be updated to `words[n] + words[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `words` is a list with at least `n` elements; `i` is `n`; `power` is `len(words[n]) + len(words[0])`; `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[1]`; `j` is `1`; `powers[power]` is `n + 1`; `powers` at index `1` is `1`.**
