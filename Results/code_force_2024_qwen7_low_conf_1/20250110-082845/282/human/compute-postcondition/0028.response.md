Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `words` is a list with at least `n` elements.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `power` is `len(words[n]) + len(words[0])`.
   - `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0]`.
   - `j` is `0`.
   - `powers[power]` is `n + 1`.
   - `powers` at index `1` is `1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it will run from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `0`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become `1`.
   - Since the loop is defined to run `n` times, and `j` starts at `0`, the loop will execute for all values of `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - After the current iteration, the only state that changes is `j`.

5. **New State:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `words` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `power` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `concatenated` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `1`.
   - `powers[power]` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `powers` at index `1` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer; `words` is a list with at least `n` elements; `i` is `n`; `power` is `len(words[n]) + len(words[0])`; `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0]`; `j` is `1`; `powers[power]` is `n + 1`; `powers` at index `1` is `1`.**
