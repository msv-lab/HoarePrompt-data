Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[n-1]`.
- `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`.
- `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(n + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring.
- `i` is `0`.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `j` should be in the range `[0, n-1]`.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - Given that `i` is `0`, this value does not change within the loop (assuming no changes are made to `i` inside the loop body).

3. **Variable `concatenated`:**
   - `concatenated` is already defined as `words[n] + words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[n-1]`. This value does not change during the loop, so no adjustment is needed.

4. **Variable `power`:**
   - `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`. This value is derived from the concatenation and does not change during the loop, so no adjustment is needed.

5. **List `powers[power]`:**
   - `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(n + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring. Since the loop iterates over `j`, this list will be populated with these tuples as the loop progresses.

6. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will run for each `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `j` is in the range `[0, n-1]`. Therefore, we need to adjust the initial state to reflect this condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[n-1]`, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(n + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring, `i` is `0`, `j` must be in the range `[0, n-1]`**
