To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step and consider the dependencies and changes in the variables.

### Initial Analysis

- **Variables:**
  - `concatenated`: A string formed by concatenating `words[i]` and `words[j]`.
  - `power`: The number of unique substrings of `concatenated`.
  - `powers[power]`: A tuple containing indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring, where `i` is the index of the word in `words` and `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

- **Loop Iteration:**
  - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
  - For each iteration, `concatenated` is updated to `words[i] + words[j]`.
  - `power` is calculated as the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`.
  - `powers[power]` is updated with the indices `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `words` is a list with at least `n` elements.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `power` is undefined.
   - `powers[power]` is `(n + 1, n)`.

2. **After 1st Iteration (j = 0):**
   - `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0]`.
   - `power` is `len(words[n]) + len(words[0])`.
   - `powers[power]` is updated with `(n + 1, 1)`.

3. **After 2nd Iteration (j = 1):**
   - `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[1]`.
   - `power` is `len(words[n]) + len(words[1]) / 2 * (len(words[n]) + len(words[1]) + 1)`.
   - `powers[power]` is updated with `(n + 2, 2)`.

4. **General Iteration (j from 0 to n-1):**
   - For each `j`, `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[j]`.
   - `power` is updated based on the length of `concatenated` and its unique substrings.
   - `powers[power]` is updated with the indices `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

### Final State After All Iterations

- **Concatenated String:**
  - The loop concatenates each word in `words` with `words[n]` exactly once.
  - Therefore, the final `concatenated` string will be `words[n] + words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[n-1]`.

- **Power Calculation:**
  - The number of unique substrings of a string `s` of length `m` is given by the formula: \( \sum_{k=1}^{m} (m - k + 1) = \frac{m(m+1)}{2} \).
  - For `concatenated`, the length is `len(words[n]) + sum(len(words[j]) for j in range(n))`.
  - The number of unique substrings `power` will be calculated accordingly.

- **Powers Dictionary:**
  - `powers[power]` will contain tuples of indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring, where `i` is always `n` and `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

### Output State

The loop will execute exactly `n` times because `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`. The final values of the variables after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[n-1]`, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(n + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring, `i` is `n`.**
