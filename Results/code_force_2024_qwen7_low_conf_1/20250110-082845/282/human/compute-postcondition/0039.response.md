The code `concatenated = words[i] + words[j]` concatenates the string at index `i` with the string at index `j + 1` in the list `words`. Given the initial state:

- `concatenated` is `words[0] + words[j + 1]`
- `power` is the number of unique substrings of the new `concatenated`
- `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 2)` for each unique substring
- `i` is 0
- `j` is in the range `[1, n-1]`
- `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of the new `concatenated`

After executing the code:

- The value of `concatenated` changes to `words[i] + words[j]`, which is `words[0] + words[j + 1]` since `i` is 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`concatenated` is `words[0] + words[j + 1]`, `power` is the number of unique substrings of the new `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 2)` for each unique substring, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range `[1, n-1]`**.
