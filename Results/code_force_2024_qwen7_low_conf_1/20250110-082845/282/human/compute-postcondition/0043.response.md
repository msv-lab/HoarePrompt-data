The given code snippet updates the value of `concatenated` to `words[i] + words[j]`. However, the provided initial state does not specify the values of `i` and `j`, and the snippet itself does not show these values being defined. Given the constraints and the information provided, let's proceed with the understanding that `i` is 1 as mentioned in the initial state, and `j` is implicitly part of the loop condition but not explicitly defined here.

Since `i` is 1, the updated `concatenated` will be `words[1] + words[j]`. The other variables (`power` and `powers[power]`) and `i` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code snippet is:

Output State: **`concatenated` is `words[1] + words[j]`, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 3)` for the next unique substring, `i` is 1**.
