Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `concatenated` is `words[0] + words[j + 1]`
  - `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`
  - `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 2)` for each unique substring
  - `i` is 1
  - `powers[power]` is `(1, j + 1)`

- **Loop statement:**
  ```python
  for j in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

2. **Current State:**
   - We know that `j` is currently `j + 1` (since `powers[power]` contains `(1, j + 1)`).
   - This means that the previous value of `j` was `j`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it `j + 2`.
   - Thus, the new value of `j` will be `j + 2`.

4. **Updating the State:**
   - `concatenated` remains the same as it is based on `words[0] + words[j + 1]`.
   - `power` will remain the same since it is determined by the unique substrings of `concatenated`.
   - `powers[power]` will update to contain the tuple `(1, j + 3)` for the next unique substring found.
   - `i` remains 1.

### Final State
After the next iteration of the loop, the state will be:
- `concatenated` is still `words[0] + words[j + 1]`
- `power` is still the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`
- `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 3)` for the next unique substring
- `i` is still 1

Thus, the updated state is:
State: **`concatenated` is `words[0] + words[j + 1]`, `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 3)` for each unique substring, `i` is 1**
