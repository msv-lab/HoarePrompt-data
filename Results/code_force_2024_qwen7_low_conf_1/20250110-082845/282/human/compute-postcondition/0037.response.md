The code `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1` updates the value of `powers[power]` to be the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is in the range `[0, n-1]`, the updated values are:

- `i + 1` is `0 + 1`, which equals `1`.
- `j + 1` remains `j + 1`.

Therefore, the value of `powers[power]` is now the tuple `(1, j + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`concatenated` is `words[0] + words[j]`, `power` is the number of unique substrings of the original `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(1, j + 1)` for each unique substring, `i` is 0, `j` is in the range `[0, n-1]`, and `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`.**
