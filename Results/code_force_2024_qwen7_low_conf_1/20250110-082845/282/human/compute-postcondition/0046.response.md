Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- `concatenated` is `words[n] + words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[n-1]`
- `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`
- `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(n + 1, j + 1)` for each unique substring
- `i` is `0`

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(n):
    concatenated = words[i] + words[j]
    power = len(set(concatenated[k:l] for k in range(len(concatenated)) for l in range(k + 1, len(concatenated) + 1)))
    powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1
```

### Analysis
1. **Inner Loop Iterations**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`. For each `j`, it constructs a new `concatenated` string by concatenating `words[i]` and `words[j]`.

2. **Unique Substrings Calculation**: The `power` variable is calculated as the number of unique substrings in the newly formed `concatenated` string. This is done by creating a set of all possible substrings of `concatenated`.

3. **Storing Indices**: The indices `(i+1, j+1)` are stored in `powers[power]` for each unique substring.

4. **Final Iteration**: After the loop completes, `i` will have been incremented (or modified in some way during the loop, but we need to assume it doesn't change fundamentally).

### Final Output State
After the loop has executed for all `j` from `0` to `n-1`, the final state will be:

- `concatenated` will be the result of concatenating all `words` in a specific order determined by the loop.
- `power` will be the number of unique substrings in this final `concatenated` string.
- `powers[power]` will contain tuples of indices `(i+1, j+1)` for each unique substring.
- `i` will be the last value it was assigned during the loop.

Since the loop iterates over all `j` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` will eventually become `n` after the loop completes (if `i` starts at `0` and increments properly).

### Output State
Output State: **`concatenated` is the result of concatenating `words[i]` and `words[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `n-1`, `power` is the number of unique substrings in `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i+1, j+1)` for each unique substring, `i` is `n`**, assuming `i` starts at `0` and increments by 1 for each iteration. If `i` is modified differently, adjust accordingly.

Thus, the final output state is:
**`concatenated` is the result of concatenating `words[i]` and `words[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `n-1`, `power` is the number of unique substrings in `concatenated`, `powers[power]` contains tuples of indices `(i+1, j+1)` for each unique substring, `i` is `n`.**
