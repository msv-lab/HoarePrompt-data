The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but seems to imply a set of constraints where `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and for each query, `p_j` is an integer such that the power of the spell created by concatenating two randomly chosen magic words from the `n` provided words is equal to `p_j`. The output depends on the constraints given.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function does not explicitly take any parameters but rather operates under the condition that a list of `n` magic words is provided, and for each query `p_j`, it determines if there exist two words whose concatenated power equals `p_j`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of `n` magic words (where 1 <= n <= 1000) and for each query `p_j`, it checks if there exist two words whose concatenated power equals `p_j`.**
