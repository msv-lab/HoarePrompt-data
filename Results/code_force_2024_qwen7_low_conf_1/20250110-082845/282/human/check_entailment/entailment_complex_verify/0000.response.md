### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not guarantee distinct magic words due to the flawed implementation of `func_1` and the logic for ensuring uniqueness. Let's analyze the key points:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` computes a value based on the indices `a` and `b`.
   - If `a >= b`, it returns `((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1)`.
   - If `a < b`, it returns `((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1)`.
   - This function is used to generate unique identifiers for pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, a)`.

2. **Uniqueness Check:**
   - The program uses `func_1(i, i)` and checks if the result already exists in `q` to avoid immediate conflicts.
   - It then checks if any existing magic words would conflict with the new pair `(i, j)` or `(j, i)` using `func_1(i, j)` and `func_1(j, i)`.

However, the logic for ensuring that `func_1(i, j)` and `func_1(j, i)` do not conflict is overly complex and not robust. Specifically:

- **Overlapping Pairs:** 
  - Consider `func_1(0, 0)`, `func_1(1, 1)`, and `func_1(0, 1)`. These could potentially map to the same value, leading to conflicts.
  - For example, if `func_1(0, 0) == func_1(1, 1)`, then both `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)` would map to the same value, causing a conflict.
  
- **Symmetry Issue:**
  - The function does not inherently account for symmetry in the pairs. For instance, `func_1(0, 1)` and `func_1(1, 0)` might produce the same value, leading to incorrect magic words.

### Conclusion:

Given the flaws in the uniqueness check and the potential for `func_1` to produce overlapping values, the program does not guarantee distinct magic words. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
