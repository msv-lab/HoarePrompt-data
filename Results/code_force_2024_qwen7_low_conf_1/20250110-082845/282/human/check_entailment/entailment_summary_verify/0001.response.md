Reasoning:

1. **Magic Word Generation**:
   - The logic in the program for generating `n` distinct magic words is fundamentally flawed. The current implementation does not ensure that the generated magic words are unique and meet the length requirement. The `func_1` function is used to check for uniqueness but does not guarantee that the generated words will be distinct.

2. **Checking Validity of Words**:
   - The validation logic in the while loop checks if adding a new word would result in duplicate substrings when combined with existing words or with itself. However, this check alone is insufficient to guarantee that the generated words are distinct and meet the problem constraints. The function `func_1` is used to generate unique identifiers, but the generation of the actual words is not constrained to produce unique strings.

3. **Printing Magic Words**:
   - The format `'XO' + i * 'X'` for generating the magic words is arbitrary and does not ensure that the generated strings are distinct or meet the problem constraints. The program relies on the uniqueness of substrings generated by `func_1`, but this is not sufficient to ensure that the magic words themselves are unique.

4. **Handling Student Requests**:
   - The logic for handling student requests seems correct. The program correctly uses the dictionary `q` to map substrings to the indices of the corresponding magic words and prints the indices accordingly.

5. **Correctness**:
   - Despite the correct handling of student requests, the core issue lies in the generation of distinct magic words. The current implementation does not ensure that the generated magic words are unique and meet the problem constraints.

Given the flaws in the word generation step, the overall program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
