You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The only difference between the versions of this problem is the maximum value
of n .

Professor Vector is preparing to teach her Arithmancy class. She needs to
prepare n distinct magic words for the class. Each magic word is a string
consisting of characters X and O. A spell is a string created by concatenating
two magic words together. The power of a spell is equal to the number of its
different non-empty substrings. For example, the power of the spell XOXO is
equal to 7, because it has 7 different substrings: X, O, XO, OX, XOX, OXO and
XOXO.

Each student will create their own spell by concatenating two magic words.
Since the students are not very good at magic yet, they will choose each of
the two words independently and uniformly at random from the n words provided
by Professor Vector. It is therefore also possible that the two words a
student chooses are the same. Each student will then compute the power of
their spell, and tell it to Professor Vector. In order to check their work,
and of course to impress the students, Professor Vector needs to find out
which two magic words and in which order were concatenated by each student.

Your program needs to perform the role of Professor Vector: first, create n
distinct magic words, and then handle multiple requests where it is given the
spell power and needs to determine the indices of the two magic words, in the
correct order, that were used to create the corresponding spell.

Interaction

This is an interactive problem.

First, your program should read a single integer n (1 \le n \le 1000 ), the
number of magic words to prepare. Then, it should print n magic words it has
created, one per line. The magic words must be distinct, each magic word must
have at least 1 and at most 30\cdot n characters, and each character must be
either X or O. We will denote the i -th magic word you printed as w_i (1 \le i
\le n ).

Then, your program should read a single integer q (1 \le q \le 1000 ), the
number of students in the class. Then, it should repeat the following process
q times, one per student.

For the j -th student, it should first read a single integer p_j , the power
of their spell. It is guaranteed that this number is computed by choosing two
indices u_j and v_j independently and uniformly at random between 1 and n
inclusive, concatenating w_{u_j} and w_{v_j} , and finding the number of
different non-empty substrings of the resulting string. Then, your program
must print the numbers u_j and v_j , in this order (1 \le u_j, v_j \le n ).

Note that it is not enough to find any two magic words that concatenate into a
spell with the given power. You must find the exact words used by the student
in the exact order.

Remember to flush the output stream after printing all magic words and after
printing u_j and v_j for each student.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, which represent the indices of magic words with the constraint that 1 <= a, b <= n and are valid indices previously printed by the program. After executing, the function returns a calculated value based on the given conditions. Specifically, if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it returns the value `((a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1)`. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns the value `((a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1)`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling beyond the given conditions. The function does not modify any external state and only uses the input parameters `a` and `b` to compute its output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Magic Word Generation**: 
   - The program is supposed to generate `n` distinct magic words, each consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'.
   - It uses a function `func_1(a, b)` to generate unique substrings that help in determining whether a combination of two words can be added without violating the uniqueness condition.
   - The `func_1` function generates a unique identifier for substrings formed by concatenating two indices. This helps in ensuring that the generated substrings are unique across all possible combinations of words.

2. **Checking Validity of Words**:
   - The loop checks if a word can be added to the list of words without creating duplicate substrings when combined with existing words or with itself.
   - If adding a word does not violate the uniqueness condition, it updates the dictionary `q` with these substrings and adds the word to the list `w`.

3. **Printing Magic Words**:
   - After generating `n` unique magic words, the program prints them. Each word is constructed in a simple format ('XO' + some 'X' characters), but the specific format does not affect the correctness of the solution as long as the words remain distinct and contain valid characters.

4. **Handling Student Requests**:
   - For each student request, the program reads the spell power `p_j`.
   - It then looks up the indices `u_j` and `v_j` in the dictionary `q`, which maps substring identifiers to the indices of the corresponding magic words.
   - The program correctly prints the indices of the words that form the requested spell power.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program follows the requirements correctly. It ensures that the generated magic words are distinct and that the interactions with the student requests are handled accurately.
   - The use of `func_1` ensures that the substrings are unique, which is necessary to meet the problem constraints.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
