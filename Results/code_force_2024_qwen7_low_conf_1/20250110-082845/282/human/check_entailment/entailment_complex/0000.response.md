Reasoning:

1. **Magic Word Generation**: The program generates `n` distinct magic words consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'. The condition checks ensure that the generated words are unique and meet the length constraints. The function `func_1` is used to generate unique identifiers for pairs of words and their reverse pairs, ensuring that each pair and its reverse have distinct identifiers.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of magic words `n` and prints `n` distinct magic words. Each word is constructed to be unique and within the specified length constraints.

3. **Query Handling**: The program correctly processes each query by reading the power of the spell `p_j` and using the precomputed dictionary `q` to map the spell power back to the original magic word indices `u_j` and `v_j`.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` ensures that the identifiers for each pair of words and their reverse pairs are unique. This function is correctly implemented and used to generate these identifiers.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the magic word indices in the required format, ensuring that the output matches the expected interaction format.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly follow the problem specification and handle both the generation of magic words and the mapping of spell powers back to the original word indices.

Correctness: **True**
