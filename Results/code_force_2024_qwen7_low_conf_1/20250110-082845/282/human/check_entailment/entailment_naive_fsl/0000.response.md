Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not generate distinct magic words as required. The generation logic in the loop is flawed. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to generate a unique identifier for pairs of indices, but the implementation of `func_1` does not ensure that the identifiers are unique across all possible pairs. Additionally, the logic for checking uniqueness is overly complex and not robust.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple case:

- Suppose `n = 2`.
- The loop will run twice to generate two distinct magic words.
- However, due to the nature of `func_1`, it might generate duplicate identifiers for different pairs of indices, leading to non-distinct magic words.

For example:
- If `i = 0` and `j = 1`, `func_1(0, 0)` and `func_1(1, 1)` might produce the same value, leading to a conflict.
- Similarly, `func_1(0, 1)` and `func_1(1, 0)` might also produce the same value, leading to a conflict.

Given these issues, the generated magic words are not guaranteed to be distinct, violating the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
