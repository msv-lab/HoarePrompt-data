Postcondition: ***`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is a deque. If `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`, then `queue` contains the tuple (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1), `visited` contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`. If the condition `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is not met, the state remains unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes of the if-else block based on the given if and else parts, maintaining the overall state of the program variables as described.
