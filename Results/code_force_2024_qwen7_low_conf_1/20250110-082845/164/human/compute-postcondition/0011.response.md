The code initializes a queue with a single tuple `(0, 0)`. This tuple is added to the queue, which is implemented as a deque. The variables `passages` and `graph` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`passages` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, each tuple `(u, v)` must have `0 ≤ u, v < n` and `u ≠ v`; `graph` is a list of adjacency lists where `graph[u - 1]` contains all the indices `v - 1` such that there is an edge between nodes `u` and `v` in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(0, 0)`**
