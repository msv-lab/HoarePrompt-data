The code removes the first element from the `queue` and assigns the values to `current_platform` and `steps`. The previous value of `queue` was a deque containing a single tuple `(0, 0)`. After removing this tuple, the `queue` is now empty. The `current_platform` and `steps` variables are updated with the values from the tuple removed from the `queue`.

Output State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is 0, `steps` is 0**
