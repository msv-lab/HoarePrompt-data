The code assigns the value of `y1` to `y`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `gcd_val`, `x1`, or `x`. The only changes are that `y` now holds the value of `y1`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer (not equal to 0), `b` is a non-negative integer, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `a` and `b`, `x1` is an integer, `y1` is an integer, `x` is `y1 - b // a * x1`, `y` is `y1`**
