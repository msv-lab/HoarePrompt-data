The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the `visited` set. The `next_state` is defined as `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. The precondition states that `next_state` is not in `visited`, so adding it to the `visited` set means that `next_state` is now in `visited`.

The `visited` set now contains the elements that have been visited, which includes the new `next_state`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])` and `next_state`, `current_platform` is `next_platform`, `steps` is `steps`, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**
