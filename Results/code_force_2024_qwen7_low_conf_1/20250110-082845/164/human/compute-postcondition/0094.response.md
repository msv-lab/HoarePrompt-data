The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `m`: a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `H`: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq H \leq 10^9\).
- `levels`: a list of \(n\) integers representing the initial levels of each platform, where \(0 \leq \text{levels}[i] \leq H-1\) for all \(i\).
- `changes`: a list of \(n\) integers representing the level change for each platform, where \(0 \leq \text{changes}[i] \leq H-1\) for all \(i\).
- `passages`: a list of \(m\) tuples, each describing a passage between two platforms as a pair of integers \((i, j)\), where \(0 \leq i, j < n\) and \(i \neq j\).

Based on the provided cases, the return values are as follows:
- **Case_1**: The function returns `0`.
- **Case_2**: The function returns `steps`, where `steps` is the number of steps taken to reach the current platform considering the changes and modulus operation with `H`.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the second element of the original `queue` list.
- **Case_4**: The function returns `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `H`, `levels`, `changes`, and `passages` and return either `0`, the number of steps taken to reach the current platform, the second element of the original `queue` list, or `-1` based on the given conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `H`, `levels`, `changes`, and `passages` and returns either `0`, the number of steps taken to reach the current platform, the second element of the original `queue` list, or `-1`.**
