`visited.add(next_state)` adds the value of `next_state` to the set `visited`. The value of `next_state` is `next_platform`, and it is not already in `visited`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`levels[next_platform]` is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, `next_state` is `next_platform`, `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `next_state` is added to `visited`, `levels` is a list of integers**
