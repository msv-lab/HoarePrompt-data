The code assigns the value of `next_platform` to `next_state` and also assigns the result of `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H` to `next_state`. Since `next_state` now holds both values, let's denote the new value of `next_state` as `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `steps` is the second element of `queue`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, and the levels of `current_platform` are equal to the levels of `next_platform`.**
