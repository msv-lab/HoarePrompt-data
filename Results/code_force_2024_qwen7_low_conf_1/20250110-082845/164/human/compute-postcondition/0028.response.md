`visited` is updated by adding the `next_state`. The `next_state` is defined as (`next_platform`, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is a deque, `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true, `queue` contains the tuple (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1), `visited` now contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])` and `next_state`, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`.
