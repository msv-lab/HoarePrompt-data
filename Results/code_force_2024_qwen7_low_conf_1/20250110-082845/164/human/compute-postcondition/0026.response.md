According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `current_platform`. The loop will continue if `current_platform` meets certain conditions: it should not be equal to `n - 1`, and `levels[current_platform]` should be equal to `levels[next_platform]`. Additionally, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `passages` is a list of tuples.
- `graph` is a list of adjacency lists.
- `queue` is a deque.
- `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` was true (if it wasn't, the state would remain unchanged).
- `queue` contains the tuple (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1).
- `visited` contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`.
- `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element.
- `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments are needed:
- `current_platform` should be the `next_platform` from the last iteration.
- `levels[current_platform]` should still be equal to `levels[next_platform]`.
- `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element.
- `current_platform` should not be equal to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is a deque, `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true, `queue` contains the tuple (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1), `visited` contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`.**
