Postcondition: ***`levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms, `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform; if `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`, then `next_state` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. Otherwise, the same conditions hold without adding anything to `visited` and `queue`.***
