`next_state` is assigned the value of a tuple where the first element is `next_platform` and the second element is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. 

- The first element remains `next_platform`.
- The second element is calculated as `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.

All other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is a deque, `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true, `queue` contains the tuple (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1), `visited` contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`; `next_state` is (`next_platform`, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)**
