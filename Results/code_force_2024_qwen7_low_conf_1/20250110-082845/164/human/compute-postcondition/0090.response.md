Output State: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`, `next_state = [next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H]` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains the elements of the original queue plus the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` if `next_state` is not already in `visited`. If `current_platform` equals `n-1`, the function returns `steps`. Otherwise, the state remains as the initial state where `levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of `queue`, `steps` is the second element of `queue`, `changes[current_platform]` is unchanged, `H` is unchanged, `queue` is now a list with the first element removed, and `visited` is a set of unique tuples representing the levels and changes modulo H for each platform.**
