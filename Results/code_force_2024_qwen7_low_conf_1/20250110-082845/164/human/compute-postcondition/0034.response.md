The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` tuple to the `visited` set. The `next_state` is defined as `(`next_platform`, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. Given this, the `next_state` tuple is added to the `visited` set, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` contains the tuples (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1) and (the previously contained tuple), `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true, `visited` now contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])` and the new `next_state` tuple, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` must not be equal to `n - 1`.**
