The code initializes a set called `visited` with a single tuple `(0, levels[0])`. This means that the node `0` with its corresponding level from the `levels` list (at index `0`) is added to the `visited` set. The other variables (`passages`, `graph`, and `queue`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`passages` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, each tuple `(u, v)` must have `0 ≤ u, v < n` and `u ≠ v`; `graph` is a list of adjacency lists where `graph[u - 1]` contains all the indices `v - 1` such that there is an edge between nodes `u` and `v` in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(0, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`**.
