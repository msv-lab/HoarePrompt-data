Let's break down the state step by step to understand what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `passages` is a list of tuples.
- `graph` is a list of adjacency lists.
- `queue` contains the tuples (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1) and (the previously contained tuple).
- `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true.
- `visited` now contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`.
- `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element.
- `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The loop iterates over `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:
1. **`current_platform`**: Updated to the current `next_platform` from the previous iteration.
2. **`steps`**: Incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.
3. **`graph[current_platform]`**: Must contain at least one element.
4. **`current_platform`**: Must not be equal to `n - 1`.

Since we need to enter the next iteration, `next_platform` should be an element of `graph[current_platform]`, and `current_platform` should not be `n - 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- `current_platform` is set to the new `next_platform`.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- We need to ensure `graph[current_platform]` still contains at least one element.
- We need to ensure `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`.

### Final State:
- `passages` remains unchanged.
- `graph` remains unchanged.
- `queue` is updated but not directly relevant to the loop condition.
- `visited` is updated but not directly relevant to the loop condition.
- `current_platform` is set to the new `next_platform`.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element.
- `current_platform` must not be equal to `n - 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` contains the tuples (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1) and (the previously contained tuple), `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true, `visited` now contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` must not be equal to `n - 1`**.
