Postcondition: ***`levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms, `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform; `next_state` is either added to the `visited` set and the `queue` if `next_state` is not in `visited`, or `next_state` remains unchanged if it is already in `visited`.***
