The code appends a tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the `queue`. Here, `steps + 1` implies that the number of steps taken to reach `next_platform` is `steps` plus one additional step.

- `levels[next_platform]` is updated to `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.
- `next_state` is set to `next_platform`.
- `levels[current_platform]` is now equal to `levels[next_platform]`.
- `next_state` is added to `visited`.

The `queue` is updated, but its exact contents cannot be specified without knowing the initial contents of `queue`. However, we know that a new tuple has been appended.

Output State: **`levels[next_platform]` is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, `next_state` is `next_platform`, `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `next_state` is added to `visited`, `queue` contains the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` in addition to its previous contents**.
