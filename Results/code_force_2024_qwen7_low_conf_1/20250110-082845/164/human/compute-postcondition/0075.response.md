The code appends a tuple containing `next_platform` and `steps + 1` to the `queue`. Given the initial state:

- `current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`
- `steps` is the second element of `queue`
- `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`
- `next_state` is not in `visited`
- `visited` now contains `next_state`

After executing the code snippet, the `queue` will have its current last element updated. Specifically, the last element of `queue` will now be the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`.

Output State: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `steps` is the second element of `queue` + 1, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, `next_state` is not in `visited`, and `visited` now contains `next_state`.**
