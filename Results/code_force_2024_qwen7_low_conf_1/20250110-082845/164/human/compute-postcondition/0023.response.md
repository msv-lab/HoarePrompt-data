The code appends a tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the queue. Given the initial state, the value of `next_platform` is updated from `current_platform`, and `steps` is incremented by 1.

- The `queue` is an empty deque before this operation.
- After appending `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, the `queue` now contains this new tuple.
- The `current_platform` remains unchanged, but it is no longer equal to `n - 1` since the condition is checked before this line of code.
- The `visited` set still contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`.
- The `next_state` and `current_platform` are still defined as given.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1), `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `next_state`, `current_platform` is `next_platform`, `steps` is `steps` + 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**
