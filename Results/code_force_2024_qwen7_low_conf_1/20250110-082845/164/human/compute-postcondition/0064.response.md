Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is unchanged, `current_platform` is unchanged, `changes[current_platform]` is unchanged, `H` is unchanged, `queue` is a list containing tuples of the form `(platform, steps)`, where `steps` is the number of steps taken to reach `platform` from an initial platform, `visited` is a set of unique tuples representing the levels and changes modulo `H` for each platform, `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the `graph[current_platform]` to find `next_platform` such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`.
- When this condition is met, the `next_state` is calculated and checked if it is not in `visited`. If it is not in `visited`, it is added to `visited` and `queue` is updated with the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`.
- The loop continues until no more valid `next_platform` can be found that satisfies the condition `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`.

After the loop finishes executing, `queue` will contain all the valid paths and corresponding steps taken to reach those platforms, starting from the initial platform. `visited` will contain all unique levels and changes modulo `H` for the platforms encountered during the loop iterations. The values of `levels[current_platform]`, `current_platform`, `changes[current_platform]`, and `H` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
