Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and `steps` is the second element of `queue`. If `current_platform` equals `n-1`, the function returns `steps`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the initial state where `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `current_platform` is the first element of `queue`, `steps` is the second element of `queue`, `changes[current_platform]` is unchanged, `H` is unchanged, `queue` is now a list with the first element removed, and `visited` is a set of unique tuples representing the levels and changes modulo H for each platform.***
