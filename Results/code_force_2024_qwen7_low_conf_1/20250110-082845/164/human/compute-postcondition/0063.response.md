Postcondition: ***`levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `next_state` is added to `visited`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` in addition to its previous contents. This occurs if and only if `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
