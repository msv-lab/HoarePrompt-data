Postcondition: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is 0, `steps` is 0, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, and `next_state` is not in `visited`**
