The code snippet appends a tuple containing `next_platform` and `steps + 1` to the `queue`. The variable `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform`, and `steps` is the number of steps taken to reach `next_platform`. The initial state includes that `current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`, `next_state` is a tuple of `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, and `visited` contains `next_state`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `current_platform` remains unchanged.
- The value of `next_platform` remains unchanged.
- The value of `next_state` remains unchanged since it is not modified in the code snippet.
- The `queue` is updated by appending the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`, `next_state` is a tuple of `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, `visited` contains `next_state`, `queue` now contains the elements of the original queue plus the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`**.
