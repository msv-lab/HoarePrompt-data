The code appends a tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the `queue`. 

- `current_platform` remains the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`.
- `next_platform` remains a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`.
- `next_state` is added to `visited` and its value is `[next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H]`.

After executing the code, the `queue` is updated by appending the new tuple.

Output State: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`, `next_state` is added to `visited` and its value is `[next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H]`, `queue` contains the elements of the original queue plus the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`**
