You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and H are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9; m is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; levels is a list of n integers representing the initial levels of each platform, where 0 ≤ levels[i] ≤ H-1 for all i; changes is a list of n integers representing the level change for each platform, where 0 ≤ changes[i] ≤ H-1 for all i; passages is a list of m tuples, each describing a passage between two platforms as a pair of integers (i, j), where 0 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j.
```
def func_1(n, m, H, levels, changes, passages):
```
Output: Case_1: `The program returns steps which is 0

Case_2: `The program returns steps` where `steps` is the number of steps taken to reach the current platform considering the changes and modulus operation with `H`

Case_3: The program returns `steps` which is the second element of the original `queue` list

Case_4: The program returns -1

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
