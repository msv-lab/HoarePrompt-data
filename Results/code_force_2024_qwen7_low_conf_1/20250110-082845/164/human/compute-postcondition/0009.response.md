Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and computes their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Depending on the initial values of `a` and `b`, the function can return one of two sets of values:

1. If `a` is zero, the function returns `b` with its original value (an integer such that `b >= 0`), 0, and 1.
2. Otherwise, the function recursively calculates the GCD and related coefficients `x` and `y` and returns them: `gcd_val`, which is the GCD of `a` and `b`, `x`, which is `y1 - b // a * x1`, and `y`, which is `y1`.

This function effectively provides the GCD of two numbers along with the Bézout coefficients, satisfying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where `a` is zero, returning `b`, 0, and 1.
- For all other cases, the function correctly applies the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute the GCD and related coefficients.**

**Final State of the Program After Conclusion:**
- If `a` is zero, the function returns `b` with its original value, 0, and 1.
- Otherwise, the function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, along with the Bézout coefficients `x` and `y`.**
