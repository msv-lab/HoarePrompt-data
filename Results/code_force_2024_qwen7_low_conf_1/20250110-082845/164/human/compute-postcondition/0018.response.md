According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `current_platform` and the contents of `graph[current_platform]`. The loop will execute if there are any elements in `graph[current_platform]`.

Let's break down the states:

1. **`current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`:** This condition ensures that the loop should execute as long as the current platform is not the last platform.

2. **`graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element:** For the loop to execute, there must be at least one adjacent platform in the adjacency list corresponding to the current platform.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Here's the modified state:

State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is 0, `steps` is 0, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`**
