Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`. If `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, then `steps` is incremented by 1 and `next_platform` is added to `visited` if it is not already present. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
