Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`. This means the loop will execute as long as there are valid `next_platform` values in `graph[current_platform]`.

2. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`: This means the current platform and the next platform have the same level.
   - `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms.
   - `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform.
   - If `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`, then `next_state` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.

3. **Loop Execution for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be another valid `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`.
   - If the condition `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` holds true for this new `next_platform`, then `next_state` will be added to `visited` and `queue` will contain `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `current_platform` remains the same since we are iterating over the next platform.
   - `next_platform` changes to the next valid platform in `graph[current_platform]`.
   - Since we are checking the next platform, we need to ensure that the condition `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` still holds.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new `next_platform` value and maintain the condition that it must be valid and have the same level as `current_platform`.

**Answer**:
State: **`levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms, `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform; if `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`, then `next_state` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. Otherwise, the same conditions hold without adding anything to `visited` and `queue`.** 

The specific values for `current_platform` and `next_platform` will change based on the iteration, but the conditions remain the same.
