`next_state` is assigned the value of a tuple containing `next_platform` and the result of `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. The current platform remains as the first element of the queue and is not `n-1`. The value of `next_platform` and `next_state` is updated according to the formula provided. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]` but does not necessarily meet all conditions to be added to `visited` and `queue`, `next_state` is a tuple of `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, `queue` contains the elements of the original queue.**
