The code assigns the value of `next_platform` to `next_state` and updates the levels by calculating `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`
- `next_state` is not in `visited`
- `levels` is a list of integers

After the code executes:
- `next_state` is assigned `next_platform`
- The new value of `levels[next_platform]` is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `levels[next_platform]` is now `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`
- `next_state` is `next_platform`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`levels[next_platform]` is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, `next_state` is `next_platform`, `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `next_state` is not in `visited`, `levels` is a list of integers**
