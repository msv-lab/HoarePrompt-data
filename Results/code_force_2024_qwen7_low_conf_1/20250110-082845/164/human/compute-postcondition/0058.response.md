To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will iterate:

1. The loop iterates over each `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`.
2. For each `next_platform`, it checks if `next_state` (which is derived from `next_platform` using some transformation or condition) is not in `visited`.
3. If `next_state` is not in `visited`, it adds `next_state` to `visited` and appends `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)` to `queue`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`
- `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms
- `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform
- If `next_state` is not in `visited`, `next_state` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`

For the loop to execute again, the following must hold true:
- `current_platform` remains the same as the current platform being processed.
- `next_platform` is a valid platform from `graph[current_platform]` that has not yet been visited.

Since we don't know the exact `next_platform` chosen for the next iteration, we can generalize the adjustment to the state as follows:

- `current_platform` remains unchanged.
- `next_platform` is a valid platform from `graph[current_platform]` that has not yet been visited.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`
- `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms
- `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform
- `next_state` is not in `visited`
- `queue` contains `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)` if `next_state` is not in `visited`

However, since we are only asked to adjust the states and not the entire list of `queue`, the relevant states to be adjusted are:

State: **`levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms, `next_state` is not in `visited`, `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform**
