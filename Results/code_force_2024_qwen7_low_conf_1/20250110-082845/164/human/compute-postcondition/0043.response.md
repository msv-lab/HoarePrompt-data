Postcondition: ***`levels[current_platform]` is \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\); `current_platform` is unchanged; `changes[current_platform]` is unchanged; `H` is unchanged; `queue` is not empty and does not contain its first element; the program returns `steps` where `steps` is the number of steps taken to reach the current platform considering the changes and modulus operation with `H`, since the if condition `current_platform == n - 1` is the only condition considered and there is no else part.***
