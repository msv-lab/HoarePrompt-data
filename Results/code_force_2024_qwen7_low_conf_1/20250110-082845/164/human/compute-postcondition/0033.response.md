The code updates the variable `next_state` to a tuple containing `next_platform` and `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Let's break down the impact:

- `next_state` is set to a tuple `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.
- The values of `current_platform`, `queue`, `levels`, `visited`, `passages`, `graph`, `steps`, `changes`, and `H` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` contains the tuples (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1) and (the previously contained tuple), `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true, `visited` now contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` must not be equal to `n - 1`; `next_state` is a tuple (`next_platform`, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)**.
