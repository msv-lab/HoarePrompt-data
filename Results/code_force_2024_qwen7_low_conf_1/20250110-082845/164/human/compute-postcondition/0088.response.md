Postcondition: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`, `next_state` is a tuple of `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, `visited` contains `next_state`, and `queue` now contains the elements of the original queue plus the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` if `next_state` is not already in `visited`. Otherwise, the state remains as initially described with `current_platform`, `next_platform`, `next_state`, `visited`, and `queue` unchanged.**
