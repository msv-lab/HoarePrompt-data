`visited` is a set that gets the new state added, which is `next_state`. The new state is defined as `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. Since the current state of `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, the value of `levels[next_platform]` remains unchanged. The `next_state` is added to the `visited` set, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms, `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform; `next_state` is in the `visited` set, `visited` set contains the tuple `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**
