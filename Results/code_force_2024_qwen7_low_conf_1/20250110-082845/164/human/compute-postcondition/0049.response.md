The code appends a tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the `queue`. The variable `steps` is not defined in the initial state, so it's assumed to be an undefined variable. The variable `queue` is a list, and this operation adds a new element to it. The values of `current_platform`, `next_platform`, and `levels` remain unchanged. The variable `next_state` is added to `visited`, but no further information about `next_state` is given, so it is only noted that `next_state` has been added to `visited`.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms, `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform; `next_state` has been added to `visited`, `queue` contains `(next_platform, steps + 1)`**
