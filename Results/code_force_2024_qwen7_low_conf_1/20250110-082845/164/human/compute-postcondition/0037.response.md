Postcondition: ***`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` now contains the tuple (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1) in addition to the previously contained tuple, `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true, `visited` now contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])` and the new `next_state` tuple, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` must not be equal to `n - 1`. This occurs if and only if `next_state` is not already in `visited`.***
