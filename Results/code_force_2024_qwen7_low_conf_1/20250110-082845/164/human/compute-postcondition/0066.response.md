To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

### Given Conditions
- `levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
- `current_platform` remains unchanged.
- `changes[current_platform]` remains unchanged.
- `H` remains unchanged.
- `queue` is a list containing tuples of the form `(platform, steps)`.
- `visited` is a set of unique tuples representing the levels and changes modulo H for each platform.
- `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform.

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as `queue` is non-empty (`while queue:`).

### Analysis
For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must contain at least one tuple. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the `queue`.

### Conclusion
Since `queue` is the only condition determining whether the loop will execute again, no other states need to be adjusted.

### Final Answer
State: **`levels[current_platform]` is (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H; `current_platform` is unchanged; `changes[current_platform]` is unchanged; `H` is unchanged; `queue` is non-empty; `visited` is a set of unique tuples representing the levels and changes modulo H for each platform; `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform**.
