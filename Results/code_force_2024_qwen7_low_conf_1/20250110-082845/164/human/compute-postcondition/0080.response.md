The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the set `visited`. The value of `next_state` is `[next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H]`. The other variables (`current_platform`, `next_platform`, `levels`, `changes`, `H`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`, `next_state` is added to `visited` and its value is `[next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H]`**
