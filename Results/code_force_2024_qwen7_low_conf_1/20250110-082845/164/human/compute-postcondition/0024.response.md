Postcondition: ***`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1), `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `next_state`, `current_platform` is `next_platform`, `steps` is `steps` + 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`***

Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part. The if condition ensures that the tuple `next_state` is not already in the `visited` set, and if true, the code appends a tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the `queue`, updates `current_platform` to `next_platform`, and increments `steps` by 1. The other variables remain as described in the if part.
