Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop step by step:

### Given State:
- `passages` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple.
- Each tuple `(u, v)` must have `0 ≤ u, v < n` and `u ≠ v`.
- `graph` is a list of adjacency lists where `graph[u - 1]` contains all the indices `v - 1` such that there is an edge between nodes `u` and `v` in the graph.
- `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(0, 0)`.
- `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while queue:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop continues as long as `queue` is non-empty. Currently, `queue` contains a single tuple `(0, 0)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `queue` must be non-empty after the initial state.

### Adjustment Needed:
Since the initial state has `queue` containing a single tuple `(0, 0)`, we need to ensure that the state remains valid for the first iteration of the loop. The only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `queue` is non-empty, which it already is.

### Conclusion:
No further adjustments are needed for the `queue` to allow the loop to execute at least once. The current state is sufficient.

### Final Answer:
State: **`passages` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, each tuple `(u, v)` must have `0 ≤ u, v < n` and `u ≠ v`; `graph` is a list of adjacency lists where `graph[u - 1]` contains all the indices `v - 1` such that there is an edge between nodes `u` and `v` in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(0, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`**
