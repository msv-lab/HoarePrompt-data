The code assigns `next_platform` to `next_state` and also calculates `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H` and assigns this result to the second element of `next_state`. Let's break down the changes:

- `current_platform` remains the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`.
- `next_platform` remains a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`.
- `next_state` is updated with `next_platform` as its first element and `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H` as its second element.

Therefore, the Output State is: `current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`, `next_state` is `[next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H]`.

Output State: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`, `next_state` is `[next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H]`**
