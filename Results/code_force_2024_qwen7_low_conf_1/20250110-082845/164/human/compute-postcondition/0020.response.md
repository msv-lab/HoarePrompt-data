The code updates the `next_state` variable with a tuple containing the `next_platform` and a modified version of `levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]` modulo `H`. Given the initial conditions:

- `current_platform` is 0
- `steps` is 0
- `graph[current_platform]` contains at least one element
- `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`
- The `next_platform` has been determined such that `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`

The code does not affect the `current_platform`, `steps`, `graph`, `visited`, `queue`, or `changes` variables directly, but it updates `next_state`. Therefore, the `next_state` is updated to `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.

Output State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is 0, `steps` is 0, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**
