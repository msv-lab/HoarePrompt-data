Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`. If `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]` and `next_state = [next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H]` is not in `visited`, then `next_state` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains the elements of the original queue plus the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`. The state remains unchanged if `next_state` is already in `visited`.***
