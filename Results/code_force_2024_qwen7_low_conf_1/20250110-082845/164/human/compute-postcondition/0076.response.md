Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `steps` is the second element of `queue` + 1. If `next_state` is not in `visited`, then `steps` is incremented by 1 and `next_state` is added to `visited`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
