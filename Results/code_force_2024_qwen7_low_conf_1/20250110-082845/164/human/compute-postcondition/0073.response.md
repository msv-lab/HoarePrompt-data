Postcondition: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `steps` is the second element of `queue`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, and the levels of `current_platform` are equal to the levels of `next_platform`. Additionally, `next_state` is not in `visited`.**
