Output State: **`current_platform` is either `n-1` and the function returns `steps`, or `current_platform` is not `n-1`; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set of unique tuples representing the levels and changes modulo H for each platform; `levels` is updated for each platform according to the rule `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`; `changes` and `H` are unchanged.**
