You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and H are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9; m is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; levels is a list of n integers representing the initial levels of each platform, where 0 ≤ levels[i] ≤ H-1 for all i; changes is a list of n integers representing the level change for each platform, where 0 ≤ changes[i] ≤ H-1 for all i; passages is a list of m tuples, each describing a passage between two platforms as a pair of integers (i, j), where 0 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j.
def func_1(n, m, H, levels, changes, passages):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (u, v) in passages:
        graph[u - 1].append(v - 1)
        
        graph[v - 1].append(u - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `passages` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, each tuple `(u, v)` must have `0 ≤ u, v < n` and `u ≠ v`; `graph` is a list of adjacency lists where `graph[u - 1]` contains all the indices `v - 1` such that there is an edge between nodes `u` and `v` in the graph.
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])
    visited = set([(0, levels[0])])
    while queue:
        current_platform, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        if current_platform == n - 1:
            return steps
        
        for next_platform in graph[current_platform]:
            if levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]:
                next_state = next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[
                    next_platform]) % H
                if next_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_state)
                    queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))
        
        levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[
            current_platform]) % H
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `current_platform` is either `n-1` and the function returns `steps`, or `current_platform` is not `n-1`; `queue` is empty; `visited` is a set of unique tuples representing the levels and changes modulo H for each platform; `levels` is updated for each platform according to the rule `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`; `changes` and `H` are unchanged.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `H`, `levels`, `changes`, and `passages` and returns either `0`, the number of steps taken to reach the current platform, the second element of the original `queue` list, or `-1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `The program returns steps which is 0

Case_2: `The program returns steps` where `steps` is the number of steps taken to reach the current platform considering the changes and modulus operation with `H`

Case_3: The program returns `steps` which is the second element of the original `queue` list

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
