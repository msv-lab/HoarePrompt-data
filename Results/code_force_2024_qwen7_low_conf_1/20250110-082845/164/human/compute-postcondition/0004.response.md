The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `b % a` and `a`. The return value of this function is unpacked into `gcd_val`, `x1`, and `y1`. However, the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `gcd_val`, `x1`, and `y1`. The only thing we know is that `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with `a` being non-zero, and considering that `func_1` returns the GCD along with BÃ©zout coefficients, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer (not equal to 0), `b` is a non-negative integer, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `a` and `b`, `x1` is an integer, `y1` is an integer**
