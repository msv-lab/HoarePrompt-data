Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`.
  - If `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, then `steps` is incremented by 1 and `next_platform` is added to `visited` if it is not already present. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
  
- **For Loop:**
  ```python
  for next_platform in graph[current_platform]:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition for the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `graph[current_platform]`, which means `next_platform` is being considered for each neighbor of `current_platform`.

2. **State Before the Loop Starts:**
   - `current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`.
   - If `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, then `steps` is incremented by 1 and `next_platform` is added to `visited` if it is not already present. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

3. **State After One Iteration (End of Previous Iteration):**
   - If `levels[current_platform]` was equal to `levels[next_platform]`, then `next_platform` might have been added to `visited` and `steps` might have been incremented.
   - However, since we don't know the exact outcome of the condition inside the loop, we consider the general case where the state could remain unchanged or change based on the condition.

4. **Next Iteration (Start of Next Iteration):**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `current_platform` must still be the first element of `queue` and it must not be `n-1`.
   - `next_platform` should be a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`.

### Conclusion:
- Since the loop is iterating over the neighbors of `current_platform`, `current_platform` remains the same.
- `next_platform` changes with each iteration and must be a valid neighbor of `current_platform`.
- The state `n-1` for `current_platform` remains unchanged as long as the loop is still executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `next_platform` is a valid neighbor of `current_platform` from `graph[current_platform]`**.
