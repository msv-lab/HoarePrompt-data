The code appends a tuple to the queue, where the first element is `next_platform` and the second element is `steps + 1`. The previous state includes the queue containing the tuple (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1), so after appending, the queue will contain two such tuples. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` contains the tuples (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1) and (the previously contained tuple), `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true, `visited` now contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `next_state`, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`**
