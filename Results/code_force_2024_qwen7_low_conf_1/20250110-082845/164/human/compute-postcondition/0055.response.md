The code appends a tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the `queue`. The variable `steps` is not defined in the given initial state, but it is used in the code snippet, indicating that `steps` is incremented by 1 when this line of code is executed. 

Given the initial state:
- `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`
- `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms
- `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform
- `next_state` is in the `visited` set
- `visited` set contains the tuple `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`

After executing the code snippet:
- The `queue` is updated with the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms, `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform; `next_state` is in the `visited` set, `visited` set contains the tuple `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), `queue` contains the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`**
