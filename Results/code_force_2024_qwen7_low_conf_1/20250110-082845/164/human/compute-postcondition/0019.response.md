Postcondition: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is 0, `steps` is 0, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`, and the `next_platform` has been determined such that `levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`**
