The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers such that `a >= 0` and `b >= 0`. 

Case_1: The function returns three values - `b` with its original value (an integer such that `b >= 0`), `0`, and `1`.

Case_2: The function returns three values - `gcd_val`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, `x`, which is `y1 - b // a * x1`, and `y`, which is `y1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return either the original value of `b` along with `0` and `1`, or the GCD of `a` and `b`, along with specific calculated values `x` and `y` based on the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
