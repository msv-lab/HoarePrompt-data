`visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the set `visited`. The `next_state` is defined as `next_state = (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. Since the `visited` set is updated, the `levels[current_platform]` remains equal to `levels[next_platform]`, and the `next_state` is added to `visited`. The values of `current_platform`, `next_platform`, `levels`, and `changes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms, `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform; `next_state` is added to `visited`.**
