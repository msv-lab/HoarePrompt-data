`next_state` is assigned the value of `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. This means that `next_state` is now a tuple containing `next_platform` and the result of `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. The condition `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` was used to decide whether to add `next_state` to `visited` and `queue`, but since this condition was not specified in the code snippet, we assume it does not affect the assignment of `next_state`. Therefore, the values of `levels[current_platform]` and `levels[next_platform]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is equal to `levels[next_platform]`, `current_platform` and `next_platform` refer to valid platforms, `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform; `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**
