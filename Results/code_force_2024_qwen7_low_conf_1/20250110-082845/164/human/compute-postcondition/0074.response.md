The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the `visited` set. The `next_state` is defined as `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, and it is not already in `visited`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about `visited` and retains the unchanged values of the other variables:

Output State: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `steps` is the second element of `queue`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, `next_state` is not in `visited`, and `visited` now contains `next_state`.**
