Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `H`, `levels`, `changes`, and `passages` and returns either the number of steps taken to reach the last platform (`n-1`) or `-1` if it is impossible to reach the last platform. It constructs a graph from the given `passages` and uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the first platform (index 0) to the last platform, taking into account the changes in levels and applying a modulus operation with `H`. If a valid path is found, the function returns the number of steps required to reach the last platform. If no valid path exists, it returns `-1`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the starting platform and the target platform have the same initial level and changes, or where the graph is disconnected.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the function, including the BFS algorithm used, the consideration of level changes and modulus operations, and the handling of potential edge cases.
