The code updates the value of `x` to `y1 - b // a * x1`. Given the initial conditions, `a` is a non-negative integer (not equal to 0), `b` is a non-negative integer, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `a` and `b`, `x1` is an integer, and `y1` is an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, `gcd_val`, `x1`, and `y1` remain unchanged, but `x` is updated based on the given formula.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer (not equal to 0), `b` is a non-negative integer, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `a` and `b`, `x1` is an integer, `y1` is an integer, `x` is `y1 - b // a * x1`**
