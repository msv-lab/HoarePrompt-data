Postcondition: ***`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` contains the tuples (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1) and (the previously contained tuple), `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true, `visited` now contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` is not equal to `n - 1`. If `next_state` is not in `visited`, then `next_state` is added to `visited`.***
