Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `current_platform` is the first element of `queue`.
   - `steps` is the second element of `queue`.
   - If `current_platform` equals `n-1`, the function returns `steps`.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `graph[current_platform]`, which means it considers all possible next platforms from the current platform.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, `current_platform` must not equal `n-1` (otherwise, the function would return `steps` immediately).
   - The loop body is omitted, but it presumably checks if `next_platform` is a valid move and updates the states accordingly.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - We need to ensure that `current_platform` is not `n-1` to allow the loop to execute.
   - `next_platform` should be one of the elements in `graph[current_platform]` for the loop to proceed.

5. **Postconditions After Loop**:
   - `levels[current_platform]` is updated based on the given formula.
   - `current_platform` and `steps` are updated within the loop.
   - `changes[current_platform]` and `H` remain unchanged.
   - `queue` is modified to remove the first element (which is `current_platform`).
   - `visited` is updated to include the new tuple representing the levels and changes modulo H for the new `current_platform`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `current_platform` should not be `n-1` to allow the loop to execute.
- `next_platform` should be an element of `graph[current_platform]`.

So, the final state to adjust is:

State: **`current_platform` is the first element of `queue` and is not `n-1`, `steps` is the second element of `queue`, `next_platform` is an element of `graph[current_platform]`**
