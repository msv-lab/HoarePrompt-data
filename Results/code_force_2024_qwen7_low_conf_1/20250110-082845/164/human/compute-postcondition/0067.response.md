`current_platform` and `steps` are assigned the values from `queue.popleft()`. This means that the first element in the `queue` is removed and its values are assigned to `current_platform` and `steps` respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`levels[current_platform]` is (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H; `current_platform` is the first element of `queue`; `steps` is the second element of `queue`; `changes[current_platform]` is unchanged; `H` is unchanged; `queue` is now a list with the first element removed; `visited` is a set of unique tuples representing the levels and changes modulo H for each platform; `levels` is a list of integers where each element represents the level of a platform.**
