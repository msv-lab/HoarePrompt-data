The code `queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))` appends a tuple containing `next_platform` and `steps + 1` to the `queue`. The `next_platform` and `steps` values are already part of the precondition, and they remain unchanged. The `queue` is extended with the new tuple.

The output state includes the updated queue, which now contains the additional tuple, and the unchanged other variables. 

Output State: **`passages` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a list of adjacency lists, `queue` now contains the tuple (`next_platform`, `steps` + 1) in addition to the previously contained tuple, `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]` is true, `visited` now contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])` and the new `next_state` tuple, `current_platform` is updated to `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element, and `current_platform` must not be equal to `n - 1`.**
