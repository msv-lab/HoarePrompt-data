n, m, and H are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9. levels is a list of n integers where each integer l_i satisfies 0 ≤ l_i ≤ H-1. changes is a list of n integers where each integer s_i satisfies 0 ≤ s_i ≤ H-1. passages is a list of m tuples, each representing a pair of integers indicating the platforms connected by a passage.
