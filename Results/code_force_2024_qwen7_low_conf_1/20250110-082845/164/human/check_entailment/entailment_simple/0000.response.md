Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem. Hereâ€™s why it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases (`t`), the number of platforms (`n`), the number of passages (`m`), the initial levels (`levels`), and the changes in levels (`changes`).
   - It processes the passages and constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program builds a graph where each platform is a node, and edges exist between platforms that are connected by passages and have the same level.
   - The graph is constructed properly using the `graph` list of adjacency lists.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - The program uses BFS to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform `n`.
   - BFS is appropriate here because it finds the shortest path in terms of the number of steps, which is required by the problem.

4. **Level Updates**:
   - The program correctly updates the levels of the platforms according to the given rules: `levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
   - This update is done both before and after considering adjacent platforms, ensuring that the levels are up-to-date when checking for possible moves.

5. **State Management**:
   - The program maintains a `queue` to explore the BFS traversal and a `visited` set to avoid revisiting states that have already been processed.
   - The state is represented as a tuple `(current_platform, levels[current_platform])`, ensuring that the state uniquely identifies the position and the current level of the platform.

6. **Termination and Output**:
   - The program returns the number of steps required to reach platform `n` or `-1` if it is impossible to do so.
   - The BFS ensures that the first time the target platform is reached, it is with the minimum number of steps.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, handles all necessary inputs and transformations, and provides the expected output format, the program is correct.
