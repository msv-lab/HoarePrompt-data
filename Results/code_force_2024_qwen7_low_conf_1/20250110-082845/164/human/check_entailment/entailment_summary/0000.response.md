Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the necessary parameters and performs a BFS to find the shortest path.
2. The BFS algorithm is implemented correctly, using a queue to explore the shortest path and ensuring that each state `(platform, current_level)` is visited only once.
3. The levels of platforms are updated correctly according to the problem statement before each check in the BFS loop.
4. The program handles potential edge cases such as when the starting and target platforms have the same initial level and changes.
5. The program structure and logic align with the problem requirements, including constructing the graph and checking the conditions for valid moves.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the specified problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
