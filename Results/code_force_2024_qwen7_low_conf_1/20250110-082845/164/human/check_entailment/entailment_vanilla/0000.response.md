Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program correctly constructs the graph from the passages.
2. **Queue Initialization**: It initializes the BFS queue with the starting platform (platform 1) and its initial level.
3. **Visited Set**: The program maintains a set of visited states `(platform_index, current_level)` to ensure that it does not revisit the same state, which would lead to unnecessary processing and potentially infinite loops.
4. **BFS Traversal**: The BFS traversal correctly checks if the current platform can move to another platform with the same level and processes the next state only if it has not been visited before.
5. **Level Update**: After processing each step, the program updates the level of the current platform correctly using the formula `levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
6. **Termination Condition**: If the algorithm reaches platform \( n-1 \), it returns the number of steps taken.
7. **Unreachable Platform Handling**: If the algorithm exhausts all possible moves without reaching platform \( n-1 \), it correctly returns -1.

Given that the program follows the specified logic and handles the BFS traversal and state management appropriately, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
