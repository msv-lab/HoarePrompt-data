Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs a graph to represent the passages between platforms.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: It uses BFS to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform n, considering the changes in levels after each step.
3. **Level and Change Management**: It properly updates the levels of the platforms and checks if the current platform can transition to another platform with the same level.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should handle all valid cases correctly. There is no apparent issue in the logic that would prevent the program from functioning as intended under the given conditions. Thus, the program is correct.
