### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program correctly constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the passages provided. This is done using the following code:
     ```python
     graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
     for (u, v) in passages:
         graph[u - 1].append(v - 1)
         graph[v - 1].append(u - 1)
     ```
   - This ensures that the graph is symmetric, meaning if there is a passage between platforms \(u\) and \(v\), both \((u, v)\) and \((v, u)\) are represented.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - The BFS is initiated from platform 1 with the initial level and step count set to 0.
   - The BFS continues until it either finds platform \(n-1\) or exhausts all possible paths without reaching platform \(n-1\).
   - The BFS checks if the current platform can move to another platform with the same level before adding the next platform to the queue.
   - The BFS ensures that the shortest path is found by exploring nodes layer by layer.

3. **Level and Change Management**:
   - The levels of platforms are updated after each step using the formula \((levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) \% H\).
   - This update is applied to the current platform inside the BFS loop, ensuring that the levels reflect the correct values at each step.
   - The BFS maintains a visited set to avoid revisiting states that have already been processed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where it is impossible to reach platform \(n-1\) by checking if the queue becomes empty before finding platform \(n-1\).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The BFS ensures that the shortest path is found, and the level and change management ensure that the levels are updated correctly at each step.
