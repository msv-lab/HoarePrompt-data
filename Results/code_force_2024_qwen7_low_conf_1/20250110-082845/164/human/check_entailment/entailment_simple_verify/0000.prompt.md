You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a game where you need to move through a labyrinth. The labyrinth
consists of n platforms, connected by m passages.

Each platform is at some level l_i , an integer number from 0 to H - 1 . In a
single step, if you are currently on platform i , you can stay on it, or move
to another platform j . To move to platform j they have to be connected by the
passage, and their levels have to be the same, namely l_i = l_j .

After each step, the levels of all platforms change. The new level of platform
i is calculated as l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \bmod H , for all i .

You start on platform 1 . Find the minimum number of steps you need to get to
platform n .

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and H (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m \le 10^5 , 1 \le H \le 10^9 ).

The second line contains n integers l_i , the initial level of each platform
(0 \le l_i \le H-1 ).

The third line contains n integers s_i , the change of level for each platform
(0 \le s_i \le H-1 ).

Next m lines contain a description of the passages. Each passage is described
as a pair of integers — the platforms, connected by the passage. There is at
most one passage connecting each pair of platforms, and there is no passage
connecting a platform to itself.

The sum of n for all tests does not exceed 10^5 , the sum of m for all tests
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the minimum number of steps needed
to get from platform 1 to platform n .

If it is impossible to get to platform n , print -1 .

Note

This is how levels of the platforms change, and what actions we need to
perform in the first example.

| Platform 1| Platform 2| Platform 3| Action  
---|---|---|---|---  
Step 1| 1| 9| 4| Stay on the platform 1  
Step 2| 3| 2| 4| Stay on the platform 1  
Step 3| 5| 5| 4| Move to the platform 2  
Step 4| 7| 8| 4| Stay on the platform 2  
Step 5| 9| 1| 4| Stay on the platform 2  
Step 6| 1| 4| 4| Move to the platform 3

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs a graph to represent the passages between platforms.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: It uses BFS to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform n, considering the changes in levels after each step.
3. **Level and Change Management**: It properly updates the levels of the platforms and checks if the current platform can transition to another platform with the same level.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should handle all valid cases correctly. There is no apparent issue in the logic that would prevent the program from functioning as intended under the given conditions. Thus, the program is correct.
