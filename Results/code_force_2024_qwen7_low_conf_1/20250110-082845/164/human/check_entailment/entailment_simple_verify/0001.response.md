### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program against the problem description and the annotations provided.

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program correctly constructs the graph from the passages.
   - This part is handled correctly, and the graph is built properly.

2. **Queue Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the BFS queue with the starting platform (platform 1) and its initial level.
   - This initialization is correct.

3. **Visited Set**:
   - The program maintains a set of visited states `(platform_index, current_level)` to ensure that it does not revisit the same state.
   - This ensures that the program does not get stuck in infinite loops due to revisiting the same state.

4. **BFS Traversal**:
   - The BFS traversal correctly checks if the current platform can move to another platform with the same level.
   - The next state is processed only if it has not been visited before.
   - This is correctly implemented in the nested `for` loop.

5. **Level Update**:
   - After processing each step, the program updates the level of the current platform correctly using the formula `levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
   - This is done correctly within the BFS loop.

6. **Termination Condition**:
   - If the algorithm reaches platform \( n-1 \), it returns the number of steps taken.
   - This condition is checked correctly.

7. **Unreachable Platform Handling**:
   - If the algorithm exhausts all possible moves without reaching platform \( n-1 \), it correctly returns -1.
   - This is handled correctly in the main loop.

Given these points, the program follows the logic required by the problem statement. The BFS approach ensures that the shortest path is found, and the state management ensures that the program does not get stuck in cycles or miss potential paths.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum number of steps to reach platform \( n \) from platform 1, considering the changing levels and the constraints of the problem.
