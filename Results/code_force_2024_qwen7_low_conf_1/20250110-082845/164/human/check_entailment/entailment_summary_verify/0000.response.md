### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem involves moving through a labyrinth consisting of \( n \) platforms, each at a certain level \( l_i \). The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from platform 1 to platform \( n \), considering that platforms can only be moved between if they are at the same level and the levels change according to \( l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \mod H \).

#### Program Analysis
1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the passages.
2. **BFS Initialization**: It initializes a BFS queue starting from platform 1 and a set to keep track of visited states (platform index and current level).
3. **BFS Execution**: For each platform in the queue, it checks all connected platforms with the same current level. If a valid connection is found, it updates the state and adds it to the queue.
4. **Level Update**: After exploring all connections, it updates the level of the current platform.
5. **Result Calculation**: If it reaches platform \( n-1 \), it returns the number of steps. If no valid path is found, it returns -1.

#### Function Summary Validation
The function summary accurately describes the functionality of `func_1`:
- It constructs a graph and uses BFS to find the shortest path.
- It handles level and change management correctly.
- It returns the number of steps or -1 if the path is impossible.

#### Edge Cases Consideration
1. **Same Initial Level and Changes**: If the starting platform and the target platform have the same initial level and changes, the BFS should still work correctly.
2. **Disconnected Graph**: The BFS ensures that only reachable platforms are considered, so if the graph is disconnected, the function will correctly return -1.

Given the thorough implementation and the validation of edge cases, the original assessment appears to be accurate.

### Final Evaluation
**Final: True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and the function summary aligns with the program's behavior. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
