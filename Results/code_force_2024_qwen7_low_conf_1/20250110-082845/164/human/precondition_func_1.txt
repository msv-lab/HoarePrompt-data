num_platforms is a positive integer representing the total number of platforms (2 ≤ num_platforms), num_passages is a non-negative integer representing the total number of passages (0 ≤ num_passages), max_level is a positive integer representing the maximum level (1 ≤ max_level), levels is a list of integers representing the initial level of each platform (0 ≤ levels[i] < max_level for all i), changes is a list of integers representing the change in level for each platform (0 ≤ changes[i] < max_level for all i), and passages is a list of tuples representing the passages between platforms, where each tuple (u, v) indicates a passage between platform u and platform v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ num_platforms and u ≠ v).
