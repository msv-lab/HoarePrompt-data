You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: There is a game where you need to move through a labyrinth. The labyrinth
consists of n platforms, connected by m passages.

Each platform is at some level l_i , an integer number from 0 to H - 1 . In a
single step, if you are currently on platform i , you can stay on it, or move
to another platform j . To move to platform j they have to be connected by the
passage, and their levels have to be the same, namely l_i = l_j .

After each step, the levels of all platforms change. The new level of platform
i is calculated as l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \bmod H , for all i .

You start on platform 1 . Find the minimum number of steps you need to get to
platform n .

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and H (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m \le 10^5 , 1 \le H \le 10^9 ).

The second line contains n integers l_i , the initial level of each platform
(0 \le l_i \le H-1 ).

The third line contains n integers s_i , the change of level for each platform
(0 \le s_i \le H-1 ).

Next m lines contain a description of the passages. Each passage is described
as a pair of integers — the platforms, connected by the passage. There is at
most one passage connecting each pair of platforms, and there is no passage
connecting a platform to itself.

The sum of n for all tests does not exceed 10^5 , the sum of m for all tests
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the minimum number of steps needed
to get from platform 1 to platform n .

If it is impossible to get to platform n , print -1 .

Note

This is how levels of the platforms change, and what actions we need to
perform in the first example.

| Platform 1| Platform 2| Platform 3| Action  
---|---|---|---|---  
Step 1| 1| 9| 4| Stay on the platform 1  
Step 2| 3| 2| 4| Stay on the platform 1  
Step 3| 5| 5| 4| Move to the platform 2  
Step 4| 7| 8| 4| Stay on the platform 2  
Step 5| 9| 1| 4| Stay on the platform 2  
Step 6| 1| 4| 4| Move to the platform 3
