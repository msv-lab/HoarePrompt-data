Postcondition: ***`f` is the new string input by the user, `f1` is the total count of '1' characters in the original `f`, `s1` is undefined, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the string input by the user, and `c` is 1, provided that the current value of `s[i]` is equal to `f[i]` and both are equal to '1'. Otherwise, the values of `f1`, `s1`, `n`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
