`c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is the new string input by the user, `f1` is the total count of '1' characters in the original `f`, `s1` is undefined, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the string input by the user, `i` is `n`, and `c` is 3.
