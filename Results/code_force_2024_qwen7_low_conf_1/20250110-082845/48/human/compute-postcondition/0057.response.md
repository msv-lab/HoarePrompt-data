`s1` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is the new string input by the user, `f1` is the total count of '1' characters in the original `f`, `s1` is `0`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is the string input by the user, and `c` is equal to the number of positions where `s[i]` is equal to `f[i]` and both are '1'.
