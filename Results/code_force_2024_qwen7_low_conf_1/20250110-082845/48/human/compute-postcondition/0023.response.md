Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must contain at least two characters, `f` is the user's input, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1', `s1` is 3. If `i == '1'`, then `s1` is updated to 3. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `f`, `c`, and `s1` remain unchanged.***
