`c` is incremented by 1. The value of `c` was previously 0, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`f` is the new string input by the user, `f1` is the total count of '1' characters in the original `f`, `s1` is undefined, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the string input by the user, `c` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is equal to `f[i]` and both are equal to '1'**
