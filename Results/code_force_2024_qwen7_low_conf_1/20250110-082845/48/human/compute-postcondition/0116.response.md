`f1` is incremented by 1. The value of `f1` can be either 0 or 1 depending on the current position in the string `s`. Since `f1` is incremented by 1, it will now be 1 if it was previously 0, or 2 if it was previously 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `f` has at least one element, `s1` is the total count of characters in `s` that are '1', `c` is the total count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1', and `f1` is 1.**
