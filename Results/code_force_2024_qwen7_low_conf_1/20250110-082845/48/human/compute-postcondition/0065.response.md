Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` must be an element in `s`.
   - `s1` is 2 if `i` is '1', and `s1` is 1 otherwise.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `s`.

3. **Current Iteration Details**:
   - We need to determine what changes will occur when the loop starts the next iteration.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The loop variable `i` will take the next value from the set `s` in the next iteration.
   - The value of `s1` depends on the current value of `i`.

5. **Possible Next Values**:
   - Since `i` must be an element in `s`, the next value of `i` could be any element in `s`.
   - The value of `s1` will change based on whether the next `i` is '1' or not.

6. **Next Iteration State**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `s`.
   - `s1` will be 2 if the next `i` is '1', and 1 otherwise.

Given these points, the state for the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be the next element in `s`.
- `s1` will be 2 if the next `i` is '1', and 1 otherwise.

Since we don't know the exact next value of `i`, we express it as a conditional statement.

**State:**
**`i` is the next element in `s`, and `s1` is 2 if `i` is '1', and `s1` is 1 otherwise.**
