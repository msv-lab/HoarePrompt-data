Postcondition: ***`f` is the new string input by the user, `f1` is the total count of '1' characters in the original `f`, `s1` is undefined, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the string input by the user, and `c` is 2. If `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and `s[i]` equals '1', then `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `c` remains unchanged.***
