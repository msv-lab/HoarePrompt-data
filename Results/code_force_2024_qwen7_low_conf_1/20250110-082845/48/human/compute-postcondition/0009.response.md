Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s` is a string representing the user input.
   - `f` is the user's input.
   - `c` is 1 since the condition `s[i] == f[i] and s[i] == '1'` is true.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - The condition `s[i] == f[i] and s[i] == '1'` determines if `c` remains 1 or changes.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k < n-1`).
   - Since `c` is 1, it means that the condition `s[k] == f[k] and s[k] == '1'` was true.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `k+1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `s` and `f` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `c` will remain 1 if the condition `s[k+1] == f[k+1] and s[k+1] == '1'` is true; otherwise, it will change to 0.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k+1`.
   - `c` will be 1 if the condition `s[k+1] == f[k+1] and s[k+1] == '1'` is true; otherwise, it will be 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string representing the user input, `f` is the user's input, `c` is 1 if `s[k+1] == f[k+1] and s[k+1] == '1'` is true, and `i` is `k+1`**.
