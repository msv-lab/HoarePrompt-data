Postcondition: ***`f` is the new string input by the user, `f1` is the total count of '1' characters in the original `f`, `s1` is undefined, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the string input by the user, `i` is `n`, and `c` is 3. If `s[i]` is equal to `f[i]` and both are '1', then `c` is set to 3. Otherwise, the value of `c` remains unchanged.***
