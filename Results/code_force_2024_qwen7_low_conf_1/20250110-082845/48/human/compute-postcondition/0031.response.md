The code `f1 += 1` increments the value of `f1` by 1. However, there is no initial state mentioned for `f1`, and since `f1` is not defined in the initial state, it implies that `f1` is being assigned the value 1 (as it is incremented from 0). The values of `f` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is a non-empty string, `i` is '1', `f1` is 1**
