`s1` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `s1` is 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` must have at least two characters remaining, `f` is the user's input, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1', `s1` is 4**
