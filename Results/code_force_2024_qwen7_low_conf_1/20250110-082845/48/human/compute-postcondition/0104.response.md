`s1` is incremented by 1, which means `s1` is now 2 if the second character of `s` was '1', or 1 if the second character of `s` was not '1'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `s`, `f` is an iterable that corresponds to the length of `s`, `c` is incremented by 1 if the second character of `s` is '1', `s1` is 2 if the second character of `s` was '1', otherwise `s1` is 1.**
