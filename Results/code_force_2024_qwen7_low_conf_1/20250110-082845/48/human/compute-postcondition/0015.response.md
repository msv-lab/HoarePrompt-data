Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a string representing the user input.
- `f` is the user's input.
- `c` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == f[i] and s[i] == '1':
        c += 1
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, the condition `s[i] == f[i] and s[i] == '1'` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `c` is incremented by 1.

2. **Final State Calculation:**
   - If the loop executes `n` times (i.e., `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`), `c` will be incremented for every index `i` where `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1'`.
   - Therefore, `c` will be the count of indices where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are `'1'`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `n` is 0), `c` remains 0.
   - If the loop executes fewer than `n` times due to the length of the strings being less than `n`, `c` will be the count of valid indices until the end of the shorter string.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains a positive integer.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `s` remains the string representing the user input.
- `f` remains the user's input.
- `c` is the count of indices where `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1'`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

**Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string representing the user input, `f` is the user's input, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1'.**
