Postcondition: **`i` is an iterable with at least one element, `s1` is the total count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `n` is the length of the string `s`. If the first element of `i` is '1', `f1` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If the first element of `i` is not '1', `f1` retains its previous value.**
