`f1` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is '1', so no changes are made to the variables `s`, `s1`, `c`, `f`, or the current value of `i`. The state of `f1` is updated to 1. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `f` must have at least one element, `s1` is the total count of characters in `s` that are '1', `c` is the total count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1', `f1` is 1, and the current value of `i` is '1'**
