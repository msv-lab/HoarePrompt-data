`c` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `c + 1`. The value of `c` was originally 1, so now it is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is the new string input by the user, `f1` is the total count of '1' characters in the original `f`, `s1` is undefined, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the string input by the user, and `c` is 2.
