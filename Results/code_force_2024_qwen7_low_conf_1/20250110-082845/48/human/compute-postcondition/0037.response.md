`f1` is incremented by 1. Initially, `f1` is either 1 or 2. Incrementing by 1 changes the value of `f1` to 2 if it was 1, and remains 3 if it was 2. The values of the other variables (`f` and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`f` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `f`, `f1` is 2 if it was 1 initially and 3 if it was 2 initially.**
