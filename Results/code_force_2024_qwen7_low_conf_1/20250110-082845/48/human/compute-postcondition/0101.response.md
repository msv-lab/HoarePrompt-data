`s1` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `s1` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is '1', `f` is an iterable that corresponds to the length of `s`, `c` is the total count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1', `s1` is 1**
