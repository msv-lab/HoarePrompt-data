`c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0, so after executing `c += 1`, the value of `c` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string representing the user input where the i-th character is '1', `f` is the user's input which matches the i-th character of `s` and the i-th character of `s` is '1', `c` is 1**
