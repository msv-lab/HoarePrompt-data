`c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 more than its initial value to 3 more than its initial value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s[i+1]`, and `f[i+1]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `s[i+1]` is '1'; `f[i+1]` is '1'; and `c` is 3 more than its initial value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `s[i+1]` is '1'; `f[i+1]` is '1'; and `c` is 3 more than its initial value.**
