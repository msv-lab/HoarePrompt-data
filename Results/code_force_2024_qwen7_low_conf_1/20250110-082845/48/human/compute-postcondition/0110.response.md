The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `f1`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the only change is the new value of `f1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `s1` is the total count of characters in `s` that are '1', `f` is an iterable that corresponds to the length of `s`, `c` is the total count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1', `f1` is 0.**
