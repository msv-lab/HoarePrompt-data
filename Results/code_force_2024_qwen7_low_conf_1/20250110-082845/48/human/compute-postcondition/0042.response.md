`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `f1` remains unchanged, and `s1` is still undefined because no assignment has been made to it. The state of `f` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is a non-empty string, `f1` is the total count of '1' characters in `f`, `s1` is undefined, `n` is an input integer**
