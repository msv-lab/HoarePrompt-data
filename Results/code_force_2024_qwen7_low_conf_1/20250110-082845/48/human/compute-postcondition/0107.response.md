`s1` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `s1` depends on its previous value. If the second character of `s` was '1', then `s1` was 2, and now it becomes 3. If the second character of `s` was not '1', then `s1` was 1, and now it becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character of `s`, `f` is an iterable that corresponds to the length of `s`, `c` is incremented by 1 if the second character of `s` is '1', and `s1` is 3 if the second character of `s` is '1', otherwise `s1` is 2.**
