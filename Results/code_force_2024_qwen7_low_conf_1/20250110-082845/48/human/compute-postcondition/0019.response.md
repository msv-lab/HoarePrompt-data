`s1` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s1` is 0, so after executing the line `s1 += 1`, the value of `s1` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string that must contain at least one character, `f` is the user's input, `c` is the count of indices where `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1', `s1` is 1, the current value of `i` is '1'.**
