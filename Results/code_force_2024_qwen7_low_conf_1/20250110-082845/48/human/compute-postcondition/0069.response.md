`f1` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `s1`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string, `s1` is equal to the total count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `n` is the non-negative integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `f1` is `0`.

Output State: **`i` is a string, `s1` is equal to the total count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `n` is the non-negative integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `f1` is `0`**
