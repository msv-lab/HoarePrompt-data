Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `f` has at least one element, `s1` is the total count of characters in `s` that are '1', `c` is the total count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1', and `f1` is 1 if the current `i` is '1', otherwise `f1` remains 0. Since there is no else part, the value of `f1` will be 1 if `i` is '1' and 0 otherwise, regardless of the if condition.***
