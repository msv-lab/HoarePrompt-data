t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), followed by two strings s and f of length n, where s_i and f_i are either '0' or '1', indicating the initial and desired state of the i-th box, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
