#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the number of boxes, and s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where s_i = '1' indicates there is a cat in the i-th box initially, and f_i = '1' indicates the desired presence of a cat in the i-th box.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        f = input()
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == f[i] and s[i] == '1':
                c += 1
        
        s1 = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == '1':
                s1 += 1
        
        f1 = 0
        
        for i in f:
            if i == '1':
                f1 += 1
        
        print(max(s1, f1) - c)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the number of boxes for the last test case processed, `s` is a string representing the initial cat presence in the boxes, `f` is a string representing the desired cat presence in the boxes, `c` is the count of positions where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are '1' for the last test case, `s1` is the total count of '1' characters in `s` for the last test case, `f1` is the total count of '1' characters in `f` for the last test case, and the output is `max(s1, f1) - c` for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes the number of boxes `n`, a binary string `s` indicating the initial presence of cats in the boxes, and a binary string `f` indicating the desired presence of cats. It calculates the minimum number of cats that need to be added or removed to achieve the desired configuration. Specifically, it counts the number of positions where both `s[i]` and `f[i]` are '1' (denoted as `c`), the total number of '1's in `s` (denoted as `s1`), and the total number of '1's in `f` (denoted as `f1`). Finally, it prints `max(s1, f1) - c` for each test case. This value represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the initial configuration match the desired one. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `s` and `f` have no '1's, or where `s` and `f` differ completely.
