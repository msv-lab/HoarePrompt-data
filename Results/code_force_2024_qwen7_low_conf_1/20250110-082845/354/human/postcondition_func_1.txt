The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` to compute a result, which is then stored in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the `results` list. The function accepts a single positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and returns no explicit value (though it modifies the `results` list internally). The state of the program after the function concludes includes the `results` list containing the computed results for each test case.
