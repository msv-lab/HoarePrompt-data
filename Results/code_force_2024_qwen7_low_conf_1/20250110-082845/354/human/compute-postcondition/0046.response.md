The code `a = max(a, b)` ensures that `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b`. Given the precondition that `a` is already the maximum of `a` and `b` if `a != b`, and `abs(a - b) <= 1`, the value of `a` will remain unchanged since it is already the maximum. The value of `b` remains unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers inputted by the user such that abs(`a` - `b`) <= 1, `c` and `d` are positive integers, and `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b` if `a != b`.**
