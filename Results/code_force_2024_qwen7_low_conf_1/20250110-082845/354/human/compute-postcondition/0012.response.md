`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which converts each input into an integer. The previous values of `result` and `results` are not specified, but they remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. The initial state of `t` being greater than 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `result`**
