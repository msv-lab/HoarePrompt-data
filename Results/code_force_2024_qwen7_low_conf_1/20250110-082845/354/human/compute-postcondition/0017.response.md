The code prints the value of `result`, which is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the first iteration. However, the actual value of `result` is not specified in the given information, and neither are the specific values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. Therefore, the only change is the printed output.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers obtained from the input for each iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the first iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one element, the value of `result` is printed**
