According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 0, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are specific integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, and `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `result`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1. This ensures that there are at least two more iterations remaining. The values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` will remain the same as they are not modified within the loop. The value of `result` will be updated within the loop, but since we only need to adjust the initial conditions for the next iteration, we keep it as is. The `results` list will also be updated, but for the first iteration of the next loop, it still contains two elements, both equal to `result`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are specific integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `result`**
