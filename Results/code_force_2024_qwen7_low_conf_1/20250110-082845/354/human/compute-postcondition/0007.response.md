According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1, meaning it could be 1 or more.

To determine the new state for the next iteration, we need to consider that `t` must be decremented by 1 because one iteration has just completed. Therefore, `t` will be at least 0.

The other variables (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `result`, and `results`) will remain the same since they are not affected by the loop itself but only by the input and the function call inside the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers obtained from the input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `results` is a list containing one element, which is `result`**
