The code prints the result of the logical operation `int(c == 0 or d == 0)`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `c` and `d`, we need to consider the possible outcomes based on their conditions.

1. If `c` is 0, the expression `c == 0 or d == 0` evaluates to `True`, and `int(True)` is `1`.
2. If `c` is not 0 and `d` is 0, the expression `c == 0 or d == 0` also evaluates to `True`, and `int(True)` is `1`.
3. If both `c` and `d` are non-zero, the expression `c == 0 or d == 0` evaluates to `False`, and `int(False)` is `0`.

Given these outcomes, the output of the print statement will be either `1` or `0` depending on the values of `c` and `d`. However, since no specific values for `c` and `d` are provided in the initial state, we cannot determine which specific value will be printed. But we can express the final state in terms of the possible outputs.

The values of `a`, `b`, and the condition `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b` (if `a != b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the maximum of `a` and `b` if `a != b`; `b` is the minimum of `a` and `b` if `a != b`; the output of the print statement is either `1` or `0` depending on whether `c` is `0` or `d` is `0`.**
