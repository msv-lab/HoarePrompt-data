The code `print(result)` does not modify any variables; it simply prints the value of `result`. Since no new operations are performed on the variables, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the only information that changes is that `result` is printed.

Output State: **`a` is the maximum of `a` and `b` if `a != b`; `b` is an integer; `c` and `d` are positive integers; `result` is calculated using the provided formula, and `mod` is the modulus value; the value of `result` is printed.**
