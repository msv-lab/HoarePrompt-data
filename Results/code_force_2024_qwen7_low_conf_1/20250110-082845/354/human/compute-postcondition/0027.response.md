Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq c1, c2, c3, c4 \leq 10^6\), `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a 2D list of size \((\max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) \times 4\) with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[0][0]` which is 1, `i` is 3. If `i` (which is 3) is less than or equal to `c1`, `dp[3][0]` is 5, `dp[3][1]` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `c2`, `dp[3][2]` is 3 if `i` is less than or equal to `c3`, and `dp[3][3]` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `c4`. Otherwise, `dp[3][0]` remains 1, `dp[3][1]` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `c2`, `dp[3][2]` is `(dp[2][0] + dp[2][1] + dp[2][3]) \% MOD` if `i` is less than or equal to `c3`, and `dp[3][3]` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `c4`.***
