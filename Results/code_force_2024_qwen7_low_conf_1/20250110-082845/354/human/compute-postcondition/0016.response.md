According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. The loop body processes each element in the `results` list one by one.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`results` List**: The list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. If `results` is empty, the loop will not run.
2. **`result` Variable**: During each iteration of the loop, the variable `result` will take on the value of an element from the `results` list. Since we don't know the exact values inside the loop body, we only need to ensure that `result` is initialized correctly for the first iteration. Given that `result` is obtained from processing the elements of `results`, the first element of `results` will be assigned to `result` on the first iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `results` must have at least one element.
- `result` must be the first element of the `results` list (or any subsequent element if more iterations occur).

Therefore, the state adjustment required for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers obtained from the input for each iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the first iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one element**.
