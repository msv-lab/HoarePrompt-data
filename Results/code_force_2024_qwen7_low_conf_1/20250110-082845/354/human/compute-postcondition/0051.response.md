Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are positive integers, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `mod` is `998244353`, `f` is a list where `f[0]` is `1` and for every index `i` (where \(1 \leq i \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)), `f[i]` is equal to \((f[i-1] \times i) \mod 998244353\), `i` is `2 \cdot 10^6 + 1`. If the loop executes at least once, then:
- If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is greater than 1, the function prints `0`.
- If `a` equals `b` and both are 0, the printed value is `1` if either `c` or `d` is 0, otherwise it prints `0`.
- If `a` equals `b` and at least one of them is not 0, `result` is computed as \(((f[a - 1 + c] * f[a + d] + f[a - 1 + d] * f[a + c]) * pow(f[a - 1] * f[d] * f[a] * f[c], -1, mod)) \% mod\), and `result` is printed.
- If `a` does not equal `b`, `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b`, `b` remains a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, and `result` is calculated using the formula \((f[a - 1 + c] * f[a - 1 + d] * pow(f[a - 1], b))\) and printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop reads inputs and processes them based on the conditions provided. It will continue to execute until it encounters an input where the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is greater than 1.
- Once the loop terminates, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will depend on the last set of inputs processed by the loop. Specifically, `a` will be the maximum of `a` and `b` from the last iteration, and `b`, `c`, and `d` will retain their last values.
- The variables `t`, `mod`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged throughout the loop and retain their initial values since they are not modified inside the loop.
