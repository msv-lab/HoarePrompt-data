Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that `abs(a - b) <= 1`, `c` and `d` are positive integers. If `a != b`, `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b` and `b` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a == 0`, the output is either `1` or `0` depending on whether `c` is `0` or `d` is `0`. Otherwise, `result` is calculated using the provided formula involving `c` and `d`, and `mod`, and the value of `result` is printed. If `a == 2` and `b == 1` and `c == 3` and `d == 4`, an error occurs because the expression `f[4] * f[5] * pow(f[1], mod)` cannot be evaluated due to undefined values.***
