`results` is a list that contains `result` as its first and second elements. The code appends `result` to the end of the list `results`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, which means `results` will now have three elements, all of which are equal to `result`. The other variables (`t`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `results` is a list containing `[result, result, result]`**
