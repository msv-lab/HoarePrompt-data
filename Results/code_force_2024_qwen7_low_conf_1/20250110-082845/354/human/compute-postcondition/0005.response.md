`result` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`. The values of `t`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` remain unchanged. The function `func_1` takes four integer inputs and returns a value, which is assigned to `result`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers obtained from the input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`**
