The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `c` and `d`, they remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `abs(a - b) <= 1`
- `c` and `d` are positive integers
- `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b` if `a != b`

After the code runs, `a` and `b` will be the integers inputted by the user, which satisfy the condition `abs(a - b) <= 1`. The values of `c` and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers inputted by the user such that abs(`a` - `b`) <= 1, `c` and `d` are positive integers, and `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b` if `a != b`.**
