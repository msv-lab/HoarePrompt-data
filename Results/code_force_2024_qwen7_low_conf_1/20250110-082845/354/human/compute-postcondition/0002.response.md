The given code initializes an empty list named `results`. The variables `t`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `MOD` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are non-negative integers, the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` for each test case does not exceed 4 * 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is an empty list**
