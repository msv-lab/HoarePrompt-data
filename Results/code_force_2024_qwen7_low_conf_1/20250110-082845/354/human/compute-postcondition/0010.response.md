The code appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contains one element, which is `result`. After executing `results.append(result)`, `results` will contain two elements, both being the same value as `result`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are specific integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `result`.**
