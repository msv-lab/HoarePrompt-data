Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`, which are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq c1, c2, c3, c4 \leq 10^6\). It calculates a dynamic programming table `dp` of size \((\max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) \times 4\) where each element is computed based on previous elements under modulo \(998244353\). Specifically, for each index `i` up to \(\max(c1, c2, c3, c4)\), the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated using values from `dp[i-1]` depending on whether `i` is within the bounds of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4`. After filling the `dp` table, the function returns the sum of the last row of `dp` modulo \(998244353\). This sum represents the total number of ways to achieve the maximum value among `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` under the given constraints.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If any of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4` is zero, the corresponding entries in the `dp` table will not be updated because the conditions `if i <= c1`, etc., will not be met. However, since the initial value `dp[0][0]` is set to 1, the sum of the last row will still correctly represent the total number of ways, as long as at least one of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4` is non-zero.**

- The function does not handle the case where `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all zero. In this scenario, the `dp` table would only have one entry `dp[0][0]` equal to 1, and the sum of the last row (which is just `dp[0][0]`) would also be 1. This is the correct result since there is exactly one way to achieve the maximum value (which is 0) when all values are zero.
