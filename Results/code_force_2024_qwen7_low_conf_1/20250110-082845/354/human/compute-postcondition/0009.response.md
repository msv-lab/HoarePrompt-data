The code reassigns the value of `result` to the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, we know that `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, and `results` is a list containing this `result`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are specific integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `results` is a list containing one element, which is `result`.**
