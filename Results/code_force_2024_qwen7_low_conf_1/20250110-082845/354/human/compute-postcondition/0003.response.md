To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start iterating. The loop in question runs for a number of times specified by `t`. Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if `t` is at least 1.

Let's break down the required adjustments:

1. **Variable `t`:** The variable `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Since `t` is described as an input integer, we need to ensure `t >= 1`.
2. **Other Variables:** The other variables (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `MOD`, and `results`) do not directly affect whether the loop executes. They are initialized or used within the loop body, but their initial values do not influence the loop's execution condition.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

The final answer is:

State: **`t` is at least 1**
