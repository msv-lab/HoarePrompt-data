The code `result = func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` to the variable `result`. The values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are obtained from input, and the initial state indicates that these are integers. Since the exact values of these inputs are not specified, we know that they are integers, but their specific values are unknown. However, the function call `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` returns a value which is assigned to `result`, and this returned value is also assigned to the second element of the list `results`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `results` is a list containing `result` as its first and second elements**
