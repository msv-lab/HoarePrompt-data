`result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, and it is appended to the list `results`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` also remain unchanged because they were already defined from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1; `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers obtained from the input; `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is `result`.
