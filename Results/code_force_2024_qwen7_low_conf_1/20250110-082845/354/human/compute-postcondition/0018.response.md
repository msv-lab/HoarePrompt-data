According to the code, the loop iterates over the `results` list, where each element is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` from the previous iterations. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a non-negative integer.
- `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers obtained from the input for each iteration.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the first iteration.
- `results` is a list containing at least one element.
- The value of `result` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The `results` list must still contain at least one element after the current `result` is processed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` still contains at least one element, and `result` is now the next element in the list.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers obtained from the input for each iteration, `result` is the next return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` from the list, `results` is a list containing at least one element**
