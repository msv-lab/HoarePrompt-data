You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the for loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the for loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
In the information given, the output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i
```
Output state after the loop executes 1 times:  `factorial` is `1`, 'i' is 1 , n must be at least 1.
Output state after the loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is 2, 'i' is 2 , n must be at least 2.
Output state after the loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is 6 , 'i' is 3 , n must be at least 3.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
If n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and i will be n. If n is 0  then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 which is indeed the factorial for 0.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`
Output State: **``n` is a non negative  integer, `factorial` is the factorial of 'n'**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0,'students_num' is 0, students is a list of students.
Code of the loop:
```
for student in students:
    total += student
    students_num += 1
```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times:  `total` is equal to the first student, 'students_num' is 1, students is a list that must have at least one student, student is the first student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student, 'students_num' is 2, students is a list that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student plus the third student, 'students_num' is 3, students is a list that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list.


Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of a list students and stores it in total and the number of students in students_num. The loop will be executed at least once if students is a list with at least one student. If the list is empty the loop does not execute and total and students_num are 0.
Output State: **total is equal to the sum of all students, students_num is the number of students, students is a list of students.**

Your Task:

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `mod` is `998244353`; `f` is a list where `f[0]` is `1` and for every index `i` (where \(1 \leq i \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)), `f[i]` is equal to \((f[i-1] \times i) \mod 998244353\); `i` is `2 \cdot 10^6 + 1`.
Code of the loop:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    if abs(a - b) > 1:
        print(0)
    elif a == b:
        if a == 0:
            print(int(c == 0 or d == 0))
        else:
            result = (f[a - 1 + c] * f[a + d] + f[a - 1 + d] * f[a + c]) * pow(
                f[a - 1] * f[d] * f[a] * f[c], -1, mod) % mod
            print(result)
    else:
        a = max(a, b)
        result = f[a - 1 + c] * f[a - 1 + d] * pow(f[a - 1] ** 2 * f[c] * f
            [d], -1, mod) % mod
        print(result)

```

The output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are positive integers. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is greater than 1, then:
- If `a` equals `b` and both are 0, the function prints `1` if either `c` or `d` is 0, otherwise it prints `0`.
- If `a` equals `b` and at least one of them is not 0, `result` is computed as \(((f[a - 1 + c] * f[a + d] + f[a - 1 + d] * f[a + c]) * pow(f[a - 1] * f[d] * f[a] * f[c], -1, mod)) \% mod\), and `result` is printed.
- If `a` does not equal `b`, `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b`, `b` remains a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, and `result` is calculated using the formula \((f[a - 1 + c] * f[a - 1 + d] * pow(f[a - 1], b))\) and printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are positive integers. If `abs(a - b) > 1`, the program prints `0`. Otherwise, if `a` equals `b`:
- If `a` equals 0, the printed value is `0`.
- Otherwise, `result` is computed as \((f[a - 1 + c] * f[a + d] + f[a - 1 + d] * f[a + c]) * pow(f[a - 1] * f[d] * f[a] * f[c], -1, mod) \% mod\).
Otherwise, `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b`, while `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, and `result` is computed as \(f[a - 1 + c] * f[a - 1 + d] * pow(f[a - 1], 1)\).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a` and `b` are integers such that `abs(a - b) <= 1`, `c` and `d` are positive integers. If `a != b`, `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b` and `b` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a == 0`, the output is either `1` or `0` depending on whether `c` is `0` or `d` is `0`. Otherwise, `result` is calculated using the provided formula involving `c` and `d`, and `mod`, and the value of `result` is printed. If `a == 2` and `b == 1` and `c == 3` and `d == 4`, an error occurs because the expression `f[4] * f[5] * pow(f[1], mod)` cannot be evaluated due to undefined values.


Now, please think step by step. Use the results from the output states for the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example to help you , but mostly focus on the loop code to determine the loop's output state after ALL THE ITERATIONS OF THE LOOP HAVE FINISHED. Try to understand what  will be the values of the variables after it executes. In the case the loop doesnot execute, what will be the values of the variables.
If the state of some variables is dependant on earlier or the oginal value of some variable, make sure to seprate the original value from the current value.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
