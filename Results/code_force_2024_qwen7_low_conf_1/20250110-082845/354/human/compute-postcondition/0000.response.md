The code snippet initializes the constant `MOD` with the value `998244353`. This constant is used in modular arithmetic operations but does not affect the values of `t`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` directly. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are non-negative integers representing the count of elements of each type, respectively. Additionally, the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` for each test case does not exceed 4 * 10^6; `MOD` is 998244353.**
