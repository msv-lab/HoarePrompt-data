`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are assigned values from the input split into integers. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers obtained from the input**
