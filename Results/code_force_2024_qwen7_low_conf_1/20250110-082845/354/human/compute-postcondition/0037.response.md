The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. Each of these parameters is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c1, c2, c3, c4 \leq 10^6\). After executing the function body, it returns `total_ways`, which is the sum of `dp[i]` modulo 998244353 where `i` is `max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four non-negative integers `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`, and return `total_ways` as described.
