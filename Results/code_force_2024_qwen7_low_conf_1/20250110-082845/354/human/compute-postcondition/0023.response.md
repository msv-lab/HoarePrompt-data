The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four parameters `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`, which are non-negative integers representing the count of elements of each type, respectively. Additionally, the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` for each test case does not exceed \(4 \times 10^6\).

The function returns different values based on the input parameters within each test case, but the specific return values are not detailed in the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `t` and, for each of the `t` test cases, accept four non-negative integers `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`, and return a value based on these inputs.
