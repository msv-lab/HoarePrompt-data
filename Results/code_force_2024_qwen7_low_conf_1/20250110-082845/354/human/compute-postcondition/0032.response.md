Output State: **`total` is 0, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq c1, c2, c3, c4 \leq 10^6\), `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a 2D list of size \((\max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) \times 4\) with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[0][0]` which is 1, `i` is 3, `dp[3][1]` is \((dp[2][0] + dp[2][2] + dp[2][3]) \% MOD\), `dp[3][2]` is \((1 + (dp[1][0] + dp[1][2] + dp[1][3]) \% MOD + (dp[1][0] + dp[1][1] + dp[1][2]) \% MOD) \% MOD\), `dp[3][3]` is \((dp[2][0] + dp[2][1] + dp[2][2]) \% MOD\)**

Explanation: 
- The code updates `dp[i][3]` where `i` is 3. According to the conditions given, since `i` is 3, it is neither specified whether `i` is less than or equal to `c3` nor greater than `c2`. However, the default condition in the problem statement for `i = 3` is to update `dp[3][3]` as `(dp[2][0] + dp[2][1] + dp[2][2]) \% MOD`.
- The values of `total`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `MOD`, `dp`, and `i` are not directly affected by this line of code, so they remain unchanged according to their initial states.
