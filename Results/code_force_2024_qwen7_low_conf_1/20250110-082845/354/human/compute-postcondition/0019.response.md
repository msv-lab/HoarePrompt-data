The code `print(result)` simply prints the value of `result`. The value of `result` is obtained from the function call `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`. Since no changes are made to any variables other than printing the value of `result`, the values of `t`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers obtained from the input for each iteration, `result` is printed, `results` is a list containing at least one element**
