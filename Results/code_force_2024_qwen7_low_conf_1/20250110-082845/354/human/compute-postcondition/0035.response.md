The code calculates `total_ways` as the sum of the elements in the last row of the `dp` list, modulo `MOD`. The value of `i` is not directly used in this calculation, so it does not change. The `dp` list remains unchanged, and the `total_ways` is computed based on the existing `dp` values. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `total_ways`.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq c1, c2, c3, c4 \leq 10^6\), `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a 2D list of size \((\max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) \times 4\), with each element updated according to the loop rules, and `i` is \(\max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1`; `total_ways` is the sum of `dp[max(c1, c2, c3, c4)]` modulo `998244353`.**
