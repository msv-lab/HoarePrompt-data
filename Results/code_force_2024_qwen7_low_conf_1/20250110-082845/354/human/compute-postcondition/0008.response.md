The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. The values of these variables are now specific integers obtained from the input, while the initial values of `t`, `result`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are specific integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `results` is a list containing one element, which is `result`**
