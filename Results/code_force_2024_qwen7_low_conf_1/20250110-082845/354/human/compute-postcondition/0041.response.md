The code `print(0)` simply prints the integer 0 to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers inputted by the user such that abs(`a` - `b`) <= 1, `c` and `d` are positive integers, and `a` is the maximum of `a` and `b` if `a != b`.**
