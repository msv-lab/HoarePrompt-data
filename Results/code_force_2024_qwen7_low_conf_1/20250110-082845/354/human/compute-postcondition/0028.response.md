Output State: **`total` is 0, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq c1, c2, c3, c4 \leq 10^6\), `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a 2D list of size \((\max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) \times 4\) with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[0][0]` which is 1, `i` is 3, `dp[3][0]` is 1, `dp[3][1]` is calculated as \((dp[2][0] + dp[2][2] + dp[2][3]) \% MOD\), `dp[3][2]` is calculated as \((dp[2][0] + dp[2][1] + dp[2][3]) \% MOD\), and `dp[3][3]` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `c4`**.

Explanation:
- The code updates `dp[i][1]` to \((dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][2] + dp[i - 1][3]) \% MOD\). Given that `i` is 3, this means `dp[3][1]` is updated to \((dp[2][0] + dp[2][2] + dp[2][3]) \% MOD\).
- All other values of `dp` remain unchanged according to the conditions provided.
