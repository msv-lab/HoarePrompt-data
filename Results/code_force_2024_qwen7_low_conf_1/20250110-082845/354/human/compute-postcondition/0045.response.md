Postcondition: **`a` is the maximum of `a` and `b` (if `a != b`), `b` is the minimum of `a` and `b` (if `a != b`). If `a == 0`, the output is either `1` or `0` depending on whether `c` is `0` or `d` is `0`. Otherwise, `result` is calculated using the provided formula involving `c` and `d`, and `mod`, and the value of `result` is printed.**
