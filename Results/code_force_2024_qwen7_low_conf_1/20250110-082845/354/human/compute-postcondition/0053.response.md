Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of four integers \(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\). It first precomputes a factorial modulo \(998244353\) for numbers up to \(2 \times 10^6\). Then, for each test case, it checks the relationship between two integers \(a\) and \(b\):

- If \(|a - b| > 1\), it prints \(0\).
- If \(a = b\):
  - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are \(0\), it prints \(1\) if either \(c\) or \(d\) is \(0\), otherwise it prints \(0\).
  - If at least one of \(a\) or \(b\) is non-zero, it computes and prints a specific modular inverse-based expression involving factorials.
- If \(a \neq b\), it sets \(a\) to the maximum of \(a\) and \(b\), then computes and prints another modular inverse-based expression involving factorials.

The function ensures that all computations are performed under modulo \(998244353\) to handle large numbers.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(a = b = 0\) and both \(c\) and \(d\) are non-zero, the function will print \(0\).
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are very large, the function correctly handles the modulo operation due to the precomputed factorials.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle cases where \(a\) or \(b\) could be negative or non-integer values, though the input constraints ensure they are positive integers.
