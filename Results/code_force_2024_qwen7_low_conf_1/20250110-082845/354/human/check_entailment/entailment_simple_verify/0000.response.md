### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
  - The DP table `dp` is initialized to store the number of ways to arrange the elements up to `i` elements.
  - `dp[0][0] = 1` initializes the base case where no elements are used.
  - The loop iterates from 1 to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` to fill the DP table.

- **DP Table Update**:
  - For each `i` (from 1 to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)`):
    - If `i <= c1`, the current state `dp[i][0]` is updated based on the previous states `dp[i-1][1]`, `dp[i-1][2]`, and `dp[i-1][3]`.
    - Similarly, for `dp[i][1]`, `dp[i][2]`, and `dp[i][3]`.

- **Result Calculation**:
  - After filling the DP table, the result is calculated as the sum of `dp[max(c1, c2, c3, c4)]` modulo `998244353`.

This approach correctly handles the problem of arranging the elements such that adjacent elements' connections match. The use of DP ensures that all valid arrangements are considered, and the modulo operation ensures that the result stays within the required limits.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Input Reading and Processing**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
  - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

- **Overall Flow**:
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them and processing each one individually.

Given the detailed analysis of both functions, the original assessment appears to be correct. The program correctly implements the logic for solving the puzzle and handles all test cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately solves the problem as described.
