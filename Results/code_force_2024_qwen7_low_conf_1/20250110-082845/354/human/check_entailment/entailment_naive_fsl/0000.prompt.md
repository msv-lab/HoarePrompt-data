You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a one-dimensional puzzle, all the elements of which need to be put in
one row, connecting with each other. All the puzzle elements are completely
white and distinguishable from each other only if they have different shapes.

Each element has straight borders at the top and bottom, and on the left and
right it has connections, each of which can be a protrusion or a recess. You
cannot rotate the elements.

You can see that there are exactly 4 types of elements. Two elements can be
connected if the right connection of the left element is opposite to the left
connection of the right element.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/3a4ca20f32b3885d01c9dc80911de1cfb06870fe.png)
All possible types of elements.

The puzzle contains c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 elements of each type. The puzzle is
considered complete if you have managed to combine all elements into one long
chain. You want to know how many ways this can be done.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The description of each test case contains 4 integers c_i (0 \le c_i \le 10^6
) — the number of elements of each type, respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of c_i for all test cases does not exceed 4
\cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of possible ways to solve
the puzzle.

Two methods are considered different if there is i , such that the types of
elements at the i position in these methods differ.

Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 998244353 .

If it is impossible to solve the puzzle, print 0 .

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
