### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summaries step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The puzzle involves connecting elements of four different types, where each element can be connected to another only if their connections are opposites.
- The goal is to determine the number of ways to connect all elements into one long chain.
- The input provides the count of each type of element, and the output must be the number of valid configurations modulo \(998244353\).

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to form a valid chain.
- It initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a chain of length `i` ending with element type `j`.
- The transitions are based on the fact that each element can connect to another only if their connections are opposites.
- The final result is the sum of all ways to form a chain of length equal to the maximum count of any element type, as the last element can be of any type.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
- It collects the results of each test case in a list `results` and prints them at the end.
- The logic for reading and processing inputs and outputs is straightforward and consistent with the problem requirements.

#### Detailed Verification:
1. **DP Table Initialization**:
   - The DP table `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) x 4`.
   - The base case `dp[0][0] = 1` means there is one way to have a chain of length 0 (no elements), starting with any element type.

2. **DP Table Updates**:
   - For each length `i` from 1 to the maximum count of any element type, the transitions update the DP table based on the possible connections between elements.
   - The updates ensure that the connections are properly handled, considering the opposite connection requirement.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is obtained by summing up the ways to form a chain of length equal to the maximum count of any element type.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required limit, preventing overflow.

5. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case and storing the results.

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic for solving the puzzle. The dynamic programming approach ensures all possible configurations are considered, and the input/output handling is appropriate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the function summaries provided.
