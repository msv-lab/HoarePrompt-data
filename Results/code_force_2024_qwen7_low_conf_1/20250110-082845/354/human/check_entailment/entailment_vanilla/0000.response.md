Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the solution step-by-step:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Combine all elements into a single chain.
2. **Connections**: Each element can connect with another only if their respective sides match (protrusion-recess).
3. **Types**: There are four types of elements, each with a count \(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\).
4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses dynamic programming to track the number of ways to form chains ending with each type of element.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Initialization and Base Case**:
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized correctly with dimensions `(max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) x 4`.
   - The base case `dp[0][0] = 1` means there's one way to have no elements (empty chain).

2. **DP Transition**:
   - The loop iterates up to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` and updates the DP table based on the counts of each element type.
   - For each element count `i`, it checks if the current element count `i` is within the available count of each type (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`) and updates the DP table accordingly.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final result is the sum of all ways to end the chain with any type of element, modulo `998244353`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If any count is zero, it might lead to an incorrect state in the DP table.
   - The program handles the possibility of an empty chain correctly.

5. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The main function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` seems correct and follows the dynamic programming approach described.
- The use of modulo `998244353` ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and avoids overflow issues.
- The program correctly handles edge cases where some counts might be zero.

Given the above points, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
