You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a one-dimensional puzzle, all the elements of which need to be put in
one row, connecting with each other. All the puzzle elements are completely
white and distinguishable from each other only if they have different shapes.

Each element has straight borders at the top and bottom, and on the left and
right it has connections, each of which can be a protrusion or a recess. You
cannot rotate the elements.

You can see that there are exactly 4 types of elements. Two elements can be
connected if the right connection of the left element is opposite to the left
connection of the right element.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/3a4ca20f32b3885d01c9dc80911de1cfb06870fe.png)
All possible types of elements.

The puzzle contains c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 elements of each type. The puzzle is
considered complete if you have managed to combine all elements into one long
chain. You want to know how many ways this can be done.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The description of each test case contains 4 integers c_i (0 \le c_i \le 10^6
) — the number of elements of each type, respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of c_i for all test cases does not exceed 4
\cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of possible ways to solve
the puzzle.

Two methods are considered different if there is i , such that the types of
elements at the i position in these methods differ.

Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 998244353 .

If it is impossible to solve the puzzle, print 0 .

    #`The program returns total_ways which is the sum of dp[i] modulo 998244353 where i is max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:- If any of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4` is zero, the corresponding entries in the `dp` table will not be updated because the conditions `if i <= c1`, etc., will not be met. However, since the initial value `dp[0][0]` is set to 1, the sum of the last row will still correctly represent the total number of ways, as long as at least one of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4` is non-zero.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, c1, c2, c3, and c4 are non-negative integers representing the count of elements of each type, respectively. Additionally, the sum of c1, c2, c3, and c4 for each test case does not exceed 4 * 10^6.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` to compute a result, which is then stored in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the `results` list. The function accepts a single positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and returns no explicit value (though it modifies the `results` list internally). The state of the program after the function concludes includes the `results` list containing the computed results for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the solution step-by-step:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Combine all elements into a single chain.
2. **Connections**: Each element can connect with another only if their respective sides match (protrusion-recess).
3. **Types**: There are four types of elements, each with a count \(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\).
4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses dynamic programming to track the number of ways to form chains ending with each type of element.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Initialization and Base Case**:
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized correctly with dimensions `(max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) x 4`.
   - The base case `dp[0][0] = 1` means there's one way to have no elements (empty chain).

2. **DP Transition**:
   - The loop iterates up to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` and updates the DP table based on the counts of each element type.
   - For each element count `i`, it checks if the current element count `i` is within the available count of each type (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`) and updates the DP table accordingly.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final result is the sum of all ways to end the chain with any type of element, modulo `998244353`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If any count is zero, it might lead to an incorrect state in the DP table.
   - The program handles the possibility of an empty chain correctly.

5. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The main function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` seems correct and follows the dynamic programming approach described.
- The use of modulo `998244353` ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and avoids overflow issues.
- The program correctly handles edge cases where some counts might be zero.

Given the above points, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem statement.
