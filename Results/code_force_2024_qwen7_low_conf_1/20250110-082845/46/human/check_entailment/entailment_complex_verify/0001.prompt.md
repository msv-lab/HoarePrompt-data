You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        n = len(ab)
        a = 0
        b = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string consists of exactly 5 characters where each character is either 'A' or 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        
        n = len(ab)
        
        a = 0
        
        b = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 1, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is the count of 'A' characters in `ab`, `b` is the count of 'B' characters in `ab`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the string 'A' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'B' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an input string of exactly 5 characters consisting of 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. After counting, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value. It handles the edge case where the input string might not strictly follow the specified format (i.e., contains characters other than 'A' and 'B'), although the code assumes the input is valid. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code regarding the described task.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case using a loop.
3. For each test case, it creates a list `ab` containing the characters of the input string.
4. It initializes counters `a` and `b` to zero, representing the counts of 'A' and 'B' respectively.
5. It then iterates through the characters in the list `ab`, incrementing the appropriate counter based on the character.
6. After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', it compares the counts and prints the more frequent character.
7. The logic for determining which character is more frequent is correct.
8. The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Given this analysis, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
