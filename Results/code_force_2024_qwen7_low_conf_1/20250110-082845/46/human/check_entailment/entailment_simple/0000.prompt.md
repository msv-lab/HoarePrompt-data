You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string consists of exactly 5 characters where each character is either 'A' or 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        
        n = len(ab)
        
        a = 0
        
        b = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 1, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is the count of 'A' characters in `ab`, `b` is the count of 'B' characters in `ab`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the string 'A' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'B' is printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
