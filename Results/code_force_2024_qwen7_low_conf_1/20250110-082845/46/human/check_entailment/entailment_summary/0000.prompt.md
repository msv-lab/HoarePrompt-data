You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        n = len(ab)
        a = 0
        b = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')





# Execution Summary:
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an input string of exactly 5 characters consisting of 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. After counting, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value. It handles the edge case where the input string might not strictly follow the specified format (i.e., contains characters other than 'A' and 'B'), although the code assumes the input is valid. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code regarding the described task.
