Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each test case and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program works as expected for all possible inputs of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. Since the program handles all edge cases (such as equal counts of 'A' and 'B', or strings with only one type of character) and the logic is sound, it is correct according to the problem description.
