#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string consists of exactly 5 characters where each character is either 'A' or 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        
        n = len(ab)
        
        a = 0
        
        b = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 1, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is the count of 'A' characters in `ab`, `b` is the count of 'B' characters in `ab`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the string 'A' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'B' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an input string of exactly 5 characters consisting of 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. After counting, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value. It handles the edge case where the input string might not strictly follow the specified format (i.e., contains characters other than 'A' and 'B'), although the code assumes the input is valid. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code regarding the described task.
