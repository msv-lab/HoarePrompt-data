`b` is incremented by 1. The value of `t` is 1, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `ab` is not 'A'. The output state is: `t` is 1, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is 1, `a` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `ab` is not 'A'.
Output State: **`t` is 1, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is 1, `a` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `ab` is not 'A'**
