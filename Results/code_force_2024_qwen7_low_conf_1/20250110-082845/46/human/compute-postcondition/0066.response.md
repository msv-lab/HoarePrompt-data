Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is 1
   - `ab` is a list of characters from the input string
   - `i` must be 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - If `ab[i]` is 'A', then `a` is set to 2. Otherwise, `b` is increased by 1.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` must be 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2 (since `i` starts from 0).
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0, it remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `t` remains 1 as there is no mention of `t` being modified within the loop.
   - `ab` remains the same list of characters from the input string.
   - `i` needs to be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` is 1
   - `ab` is a list of characters from the input string
   - `i` must be 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is 1, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `i` must be 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
