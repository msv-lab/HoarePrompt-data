The code `n = len(ab)` calculates the length of the list `ab` and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that `n` now holds the number of elements in the list `ab`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is the count of 'A' characters in `ab`, `b` is the count of 'B' characters in `ab`.**
