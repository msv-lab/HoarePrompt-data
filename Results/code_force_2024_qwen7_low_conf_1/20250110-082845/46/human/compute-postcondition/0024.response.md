The code `print('B')` prints the string 'B' to the console. However, this does not affect the values of any variables. The variables `t`, `ab`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `a` is the count of 'A' characters in `ab`, `b` is the count of 'B' characters in `ab`, and a is less than or equal to b.**
