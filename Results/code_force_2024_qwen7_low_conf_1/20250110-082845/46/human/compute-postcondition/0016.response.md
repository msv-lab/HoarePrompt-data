Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive).
   - `ab` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is 2 if it was initially 1 or 0.
   - `b` is 1 if `a` was initially 0 or 2 if `a` was initially 1.
   - `b` is 2 if `ab[1]` was 'A' and 1 if `ab[1]` was not 'A'.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n-1` because the `range(n)` function generates values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the condition `i < n` will hold true as long as `n > 1`.
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - The list `ab` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.

Given these points, the state adjustments for the start of the next iteration are:

- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive).
- `ab` remains a list of characters from the input string.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `a` remains 2 if it was initially 1 or 0.
- `b` remains 1 if `a` was initially 0 or 2 if `a` was initially 1.
- `b` remains 2 if `ab[1]` was 'A' and 1 if `ab[1]` was not 'A'.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is 2 if it was initially 1 or 0, `b` is 1 if `a` was initially 0 or 2 if `a` was initially 1, `b` is 2 if `ab[1]` was 'A' and 1 if `ab[1]` was not 'A', `i` is 2**.
