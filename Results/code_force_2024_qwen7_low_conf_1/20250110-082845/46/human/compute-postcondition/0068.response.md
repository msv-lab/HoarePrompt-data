The value of `b` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `b` was not specified, but since `b += 1` is used, it means `b` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`t`, `ab`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `i` must be 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is increased by 1**
