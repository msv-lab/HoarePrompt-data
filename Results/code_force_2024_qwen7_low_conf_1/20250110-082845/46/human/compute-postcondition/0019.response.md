Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is 2 if it was initially 1 or 0, `b` is 1 if `a` was initially 0 or 2 if `a` was initially 1, `b` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `a` and whether `ab[1]` was 'A' or not, and `i` is 2. If `ab[i]` (which is `ab[2]` since `i` is 2) is 'A', `a` becomes 2. Otherwise, `b` changes to 3 if it was 2 and remains 1 if it was 1.**
