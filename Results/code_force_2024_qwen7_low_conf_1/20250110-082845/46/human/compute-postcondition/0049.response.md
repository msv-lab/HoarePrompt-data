The code snippet `print('B')` prints the string 'B' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `ab`, `n`, `b`, or `a`. The output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the print statement which executes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `ab`, `b` is the count of 'B' in `ab`, `a` is the count of 'A' in `ab`, and the console prints 'B'**
