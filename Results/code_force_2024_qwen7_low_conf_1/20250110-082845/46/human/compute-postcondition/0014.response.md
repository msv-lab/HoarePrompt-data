The value of `b` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `b` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `ab[1]` is 'A' or not. Since `b` is incremented by 1, the new value of `b` will be 2 if it was initially 1, and 1 if it was initially 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are either both 1 or both 0 depending on whether `ab[1]` is 'A' or not, `i` is 1, `b` is 2 if `ab[1]` was 'A' and 1 if `ab[1]` was not 'A'**
