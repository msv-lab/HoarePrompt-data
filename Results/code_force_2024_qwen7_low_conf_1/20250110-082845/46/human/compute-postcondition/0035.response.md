`b` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is 1, `a` is 0, and `ab[i]` is not 'A'.
