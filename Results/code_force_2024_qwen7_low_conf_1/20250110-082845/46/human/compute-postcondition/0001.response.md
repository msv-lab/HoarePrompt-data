According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), the loop will always execute as the minimum value of `t` is 1.

However, we need to ensure that the initial state of `t` is correctly represented to indicate that the loop will indeed execute. Given the constraints, the initial value of `t` should be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive)**

This state already indicates that the loop will execute because `t` is within the specified range. Therefore, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given information.
