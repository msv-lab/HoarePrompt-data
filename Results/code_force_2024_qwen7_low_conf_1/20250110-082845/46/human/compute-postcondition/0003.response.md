The code `n = len(ab)` calculates the length of the list `ab` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length of the list `ab` is an integer value, which is stored in `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive); `ab` is a list of characters from the input string; `n` is the length of `ab`**
