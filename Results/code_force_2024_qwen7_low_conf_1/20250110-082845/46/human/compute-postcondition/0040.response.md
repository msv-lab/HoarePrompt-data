Postcondition: **\( t \) remains an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive); \( ab \) remains a list of characters from the input string; \( n \) remains greater than 0; \( b \) is now either 0 or 1, depending on whether \( ab[i+1] == 'A' \) or not; \( a \) is either \( a + 1 \) if \( ab[i+1] == 'A' \), or 0 if \( ab[i+1] != 'A' \); \( i \) is incremented by 1, so \( i \) becomes \( i + 1 \), which must still be within the valid range \( 0 \leq i < n \)**
