`a` is incremented by 1, which means `a += 1`. The value of `t`, `ab`, `n`, `b`, and the condition of `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is 0, `a` is `a + 1`, the current value of `i` is such that `ab[i] == 'A'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is 0, `a` is `a + 1`, the current value of `i` is such that `ab[i] == 'A'`**
