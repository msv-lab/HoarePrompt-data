`b` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `t`, the list `ab`, its length `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive); `ab` is a list of characters from the input string; `n` is the length of `ab`; `a` is 0; `b` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive); `ab` is a list of characters from the input string; `n` is the length of `ab`; `a` is 0; `b` is 0**
