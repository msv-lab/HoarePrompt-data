Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is either 0 or 1, `a` is either `a + 1` if `ab[i] == 'A'`, or 0 if `ab[i] != 'A'`. Additionally, `i` points to the index where `ab[i]` is either 'A' or not 'A'.***
