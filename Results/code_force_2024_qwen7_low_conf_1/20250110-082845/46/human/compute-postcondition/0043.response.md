`b` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial state is \( t \) is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive), \( ab \) is a list of characters from the input string, \( n \) is greater than 0, \( b \) is either 0 or 1 depending on whether \( ab[i+2] == 'A' \) or not, \( a \) is either \( a + 1 \) if \( ab[i+2] == 'A' \), or 0 if \( ab[i+2] != 'A' \), and \( i \) is \( i + 1 \) and must still be within the valid range \( 0 \leq i < n \), the only change is in the value of \( b \).

Output State: **\( t \) is an integer between 1 and 31 (inclusive), \( ab \) is a list of characters from the input string, \( n \) is greater than 0, \( b \) is either 1 or 2 depending on whether \( ab[i+2] == 'A' \) or not, \( a \) is either \( a + 1 \) if \( ab[i+2] == 'A' \), or 0 if \( ab[i+2] != 'A' \), and \( i \) is \( i + 1 \) and must still be within the valid range \( 0 \leq i < n \)**
