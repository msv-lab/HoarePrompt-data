`b` is incremented by 1, and its initial value is not specified, only `i` and `n` are specified. The initial value of `t` is 1, and `ab` is a list of characters from the input string. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 1, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `i` must be 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `b` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `i` must be 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is increased by 1**
