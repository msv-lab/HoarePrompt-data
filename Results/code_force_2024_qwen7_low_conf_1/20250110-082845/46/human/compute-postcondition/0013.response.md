The value of `a` is incremented by 1. Since `a` and `b` are either both 1 or both 0 depending on whether `ab[1]` is 'A' or not, and `a` was initially either 1 or 0, incrementing `a` by 1 will make `a` equal to 2 if it was initially 1, and `a` will become 1 if it was initially 0. The value of `b` remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `ab`, `n`, `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), `ab` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is 2 if it was initially 1 or 0, `b` is 1 if `a` was initially 0 or 2 if `a` was initially 1, `i` is 1**
