The code snippet `a = *map(int, s.split()),` unpacks the result of `map(int, s.split())` into the tuple `a`. Here, `s` is expected to be a string containing space-separated integers which are converted to integers using `map(int, s.split())`. However, the initial state does not provide the specific value of `s`, so we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in the tuple `a`. 

Given the initial state, the only affected variable is `a`, which now contains a tuple of integers derived from `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `u`, `d`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a` is a tuple of integers; `u` is the arithmetic mean of the new `a`; `d` is the sum of differences between each element in the new `a` and `u`; `f` is the bitwise OR of all values of `d` across all iterations.**
