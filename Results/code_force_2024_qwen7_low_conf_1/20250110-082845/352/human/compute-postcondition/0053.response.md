Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `sum1` is 0.
- `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`.
- `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.
- `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the loop, so we can ignore it).
- `n` is the input integer.
- `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`.
- If `n == 1` or `sum(arr) == 0`, the function does not change these variables' values.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(n // 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop will iterate from `0` to `n // 2 - 1`.
   - Currently, `i` is set to `n // 2 - 1`.
   - To ensure the loop runs at least once, `i` should be set to `0`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop will run as long as `i < n // 2`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n // 2 - 1`, the loop will not run if `n == 2` because `n // 2 - 1` would be `-1`, which is not valid.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

3. **List `arr`:**
   - The loop does not directly modify `arr`, but the condition `n == 1` or `sum(arr) == 0` affects the initial setup.
   - Since the loop will only run if `n > 1` and `sum(arr) != 0`, `arr` must have at least one element and its sum must be non-zero.

4. **Variables `sum1`, `sum2`, `sm3`:**
   - These variables are initialized and do not affect the loop condition directly.

### Conclusion:
The necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- Ensure `i` is 0.
- Ensure `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero.

### Final State:
**State: `total` is 0, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero.**
