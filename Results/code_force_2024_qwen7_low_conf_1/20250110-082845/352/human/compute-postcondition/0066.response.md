The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to handle a series of test cases internally. For each test case, the function receives an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each `t`, it processes `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of \(a_i\) is divisible by \(n\). The sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Based on the given conditions, the function returns different outputs depending on the internal processing:

Case_1: The function processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it verifies that \(n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) meet the criteria (sum of \(a_i\) is divisible by \(n\)). If the criteria are met for all test cases, it returns a specific value indicating success.
Case_2: If any of the test cases fail to meet the criteria, the function returns an error message indicating that the criteria were not satisfied.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\), and return a specific value if all criteria are met, or an error message if any criteria are not satisfied.
