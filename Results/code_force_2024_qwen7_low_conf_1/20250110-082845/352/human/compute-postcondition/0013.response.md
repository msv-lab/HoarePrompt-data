Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a tuple of integers (potentially empty), `u` is the arithmetic mean of the remaining elements in `a`, `d` is the sum of differences between each element in `a` and `u`, `f` is the bitwise OR of all values of `d` across all iterations.**
