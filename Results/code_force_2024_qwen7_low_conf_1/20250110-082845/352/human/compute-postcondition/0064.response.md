Postcondition: ***`sum1` is the sum of the first `n//2` elements of `arr`, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is `n//2 - 1`, `n` is at least 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero. If `sum1` is greater than `sum2` and `arr[0]` is greater than `sm3` and the last element of `arr` is less than or equal to `sm3`, then the output is 'yes'. Otherwise, the output is 'no'.***
