The code `a = *map(int, s.split()),` takes the string `s` which contains space-separated integers and converts them into a tuple of integers. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `s`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `a` without knowing `s`. We can only say that `a` is a tuple of integers derived from splitting `s` and converting the resulting strings to integers.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. So, `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a tuple of integers derived from splitting `s` and converting the resulting strings to integers.**
