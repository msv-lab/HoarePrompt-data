The code initializes two variables `d` and `f` to 0. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `u` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `d` and `f`, and retains the original values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `u`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a tuple of integers derived from splitting `s` and converting the resulting strings to integers, `u` is the arithmetic mean of the elements in `a`, `d` is 0, `f` is 0**.
