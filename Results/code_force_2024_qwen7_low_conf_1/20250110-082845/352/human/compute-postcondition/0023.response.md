`d` is updated by adding the difference between `x` and `u` to its current value. Since the exact values of `x` and `u` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `d`. However, we know that `d` has been modified. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty tuple of integers with one less element, `u` is the arithmetic mean of the new `a`, `d` is the updated sum of differences between each element in the new `a` and `u` plus the difference between the next `x` in `a` and `u`, `f` is `d` if `d` is not zero, otherwise `f` is 0.**
