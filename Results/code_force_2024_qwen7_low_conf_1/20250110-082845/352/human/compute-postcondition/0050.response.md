The code `print('yes')` does not affect any variables; it only prints the string 'yes'. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`**
