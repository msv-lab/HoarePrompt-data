Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `a` is a non-empty tuple of integers
- `u` is the arithmetic mean of the elements in `a`
- `d` is updated by the formula \(d = d + (x - u)\)
- `f` is the value of `d`

### For Loop:
```
for x in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the tuple `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `u` is already calculated as the arithmetic mean of the elements in `a`.
   - `d` is initialized before the loop starts.
   
3. **Effect of Each Iteration**:
   - In each iteration, `x` takes the next element from the tuple `a`.
   - The value of `d` is updated using the formula \(d = d + (x - u)\).

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `u` remains unchanged.
   - `d` is updated to its new value based on the current `x`.
   - `f` holds the current value of `d`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over all elements in `a`, the next `x` will be the next element in the tuple `a`.
   - `d` will be further updated based on this new `x`.

### Updated States:
- `t` remains the same because it is not used in the loop.
- `n` remains the same because it is not used in the loop.
- `a` remains the same because it is not modified inside the loop.
- `u` remains the same because it is not updated inside the loop.
- `d` is updated to its new value based on the current `x`.
- `f` will hold the updated value of `d` at the end of the next iteration.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `a` is a non-empty tuple of integers
- `u` is the arithmetic mean of the elements in `a`
- `d` is updated to the new value based on the next `x` in the tuple `a`
- `f` is the value of `d` after the update

### Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty tuple of integers, `u` is the arithmetic mean of the elements in `a`, `d` is updated to the new value based on the next `x` in the tuple `a`, `f` is the value of `d`**
