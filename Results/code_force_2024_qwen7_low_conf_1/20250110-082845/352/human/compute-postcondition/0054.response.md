`sum1` is incremented by `arr[i]`. The value of `arr[i]` is part of the sum of `arr`, but its exact value is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0; `sum1` is increased by `arr[i]`; `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`; `i` is 0; `n` is at least 2; `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`; `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero.
