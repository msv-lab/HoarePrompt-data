The code `print('yes')` does not affect any variable values or change the state of any variables in the initial state. It only prints the string 'yes'. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sum1` is the sum of the first `n//2` elements of `arr`, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is `n//2 - 1`, `n` is at least 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero, the current value of `sum1` is greater than `sum2`, the current value of `arr[0]` is greater than `sm3`, and the last element of `arr` is less than or equal to `sm3`. Print 'yes'**
