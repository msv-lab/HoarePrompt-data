Postcondition: **`sum1` is the sum of the first `n//2` elements of `arr`, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is `n//2 - 1`, `n` is at least 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero, `sum1` is less than or equal to `sum2`, `arr[0]` is less than or equal to `sm3`, or `arr[n-1]` is greater than `sm3`**
