The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. Instead, it appears to operate on input data that is not directly passed as arguments but rather seems to be read from standard input or another source within the function body. The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), followed by an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), and then a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n` (where \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)). Additionally, it is guaranteed that the sum of `a_i` in each test case does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^9\) and is divisible by `n`.

Given the nature of the problem, the function likely processes each test case to perform some operation on the list of integers `a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n` and outputs a result for each test case.
