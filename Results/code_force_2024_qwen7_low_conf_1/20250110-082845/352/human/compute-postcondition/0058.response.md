`sum1` is initially increased by `arr[1] + arr[1]`, which means `sum1` is `2 * arr[1]`. The value of `i` is 3, so `sum1 += arr[i]` adds `arr[3]` to `sum1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated value of `sum1` is `2 * arr[1] + arr[3]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `sum1` is 2 * `arr[1]` + `arr[3]`, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero**
