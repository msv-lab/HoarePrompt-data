The initial state is: `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer.

The code snippet is: `sum2 = sum(arr) // 2`

This line of code updates the value of `sum2` to be the sum of all elements in the list `arr` divided by 2 using integer division. Since `sum2` was initially set to `sum(arr) // 2`, and now it is being re-assigned to the same value, `sum2` remains unchanged.

The output state is: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer**
