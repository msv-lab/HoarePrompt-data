Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a tuple of integers derived from the input, `u` is the arithmetic mean of the elements in `a`, `d` is the sum of all differences between each element in `a` and the arithmetic mean `u`, `f` is the bitwise OR of all non-zero values of `d` encountered during the loop, the output is 'YES' if `f` is 0 or 'NO' if `f` is non-zero.**
