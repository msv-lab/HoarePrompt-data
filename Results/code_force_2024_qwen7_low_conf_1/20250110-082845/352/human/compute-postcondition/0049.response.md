The code snippet `sm3 = sum(arr) // n` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `arr` and divides it by `n` using integer division, storing the result in `sm3`. Given the initial state, `n` is the input integer, and `arr` is a list of integers from the input.

Since `sm3` is now assigned the value of `sum(arr) // n`, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`**
