`sum1` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to its current value. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `sum1` is increased by `arr[1]`. After this operation, the new value of `sum1` is the previous value of `sum1` plus `arr[1]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `sum1` is increased by `arr[1]` + `arr[1]`, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero**
