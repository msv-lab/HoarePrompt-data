The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not include any loop, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `sum1` is 0, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`**
