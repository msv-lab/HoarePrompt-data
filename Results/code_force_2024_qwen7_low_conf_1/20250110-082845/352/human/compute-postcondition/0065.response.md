Output State: **`sum1` is the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `arr`, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^4, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is a list of integers. If `n` is 1, then `sum1` is 0 and `i` is 0. If `n` is greater than 1 and `sum1 > sum2`, and `arr[0] > sm3` and `arr[n - 1] <= sm3`, the output is 'yes'. Otherwise, the output is 'no'.**
