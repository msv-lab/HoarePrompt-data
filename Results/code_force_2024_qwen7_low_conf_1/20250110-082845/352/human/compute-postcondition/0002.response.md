`u` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the tuple `a` divided by the length of `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we know that `u` is the arithmetic mean of the elements in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a tuple of integers derived from splitting `s` and converting the resulting strings to integers, `u` is the arithmetic mean of the elements in `a`**.
