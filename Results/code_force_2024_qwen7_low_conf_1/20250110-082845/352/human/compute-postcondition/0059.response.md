Output State: **`sum1` is the sum of the first `n//2` elements of `arr`, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is `n//2 - 1`, `n` is at least 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `sum1` is initialized to 0.
   - `sum2` is initialized to `sum(arr) // 2`.
   - `i` is initialized to `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `_` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `sm3` is initialized to `sum(arr) // n`.
   - If `n == 1` or `sum(arr) == 0`, the function does not change the values of these variables.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`.
   - In each iteration, `sum1` is incremented by `arr[i]`.

3. **Final Iteration**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `sum1` will be the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `arr`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `sum2` remains unchanged as it is the sum of all elements divided by 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it is the input integer.
   - `sm3` remains the same as it is the sum of all elements divided by `n`.
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is just referenced.

5. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2.
   - `arr` must be a list with at least one element and its sum must be non-zero.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables are as described above.
