According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i < n // 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `total` is 0
- `sum1` is increased by `arr[1]` + `arr[1]`
- `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`
- `i` is 2
- `n` is at least 2
- `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`
- `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` will be 3.
- `n` must remain at least 2 (since `n` being at least 2 is a requirement and does not change based on the loop iteration).
- `sm3` will remain the same because it is dependent on the value of `n` and the sum of `arr`, which do not change within the loop body.

Therefore, the new states after adjusting for the next iteration are:
- `total` remains 0
- `sum1` remains increased by `arr[1]` + `arr[1]`
- `sum2` remains `sum(arr) // 2`
- `i` is now 3
- `n` must be at least 2
- `sm3` remains `sum(arr) // n`
- `arr` remains a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero

State: **`total` is 0, `sum1` is increased by `arr[1]` + `arr[1]`, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero**
