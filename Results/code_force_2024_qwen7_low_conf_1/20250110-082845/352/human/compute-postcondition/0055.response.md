Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `sum1` is increased by `arr[i]`
   - `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is at least 2
   - `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`
   - `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in the range `n // 2`. 

3. **Current Iteration Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 0, the next value for `i` would be 1 (assuming the loop increments `i` by 1).
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n // 2` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` remains the same and is still at least 2.
   - `total` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `sum1` will be further modified based on the next value of `i`.
   - `sum2` remains the same as it is not dependent on `i`.
   - `sm3` remains the same as it is not dependent on `i`.
   - `arr` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.

Given these considerations, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop:

**State:**
- `total` is 0
- `sum1` is increased by `arr[1]` (assuming the loop body updates `sum1`)
- `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`
- `i` is 1
- `n` is at least 2
- `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`
- `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero

So, the final state adjustment for the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `sum1` is increased by `arr[1]`, `sum2` is `sum(arr) // 2`, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `sm3` is `sum(arr) // n`, `arr` is a list with at least one element and its sum is non-zero**
