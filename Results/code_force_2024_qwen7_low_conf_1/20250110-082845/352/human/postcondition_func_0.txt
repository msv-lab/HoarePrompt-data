The function processes a series of test cases via standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `t` (number of test cases) followed by pairs of lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (number of elements in the array), and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, the function calculates the arithmetic mean `u` of the elements in the array `a`. It then computes the sum of the absolute differences between each element and the mean `u`, stored in `d`, and performs a bitwise OR operation on all non-zero values of `d`, stored in `f`. Finally, the function prints 'YES' if `f` is 0 (indicating all differences are zero, meaning the array can be balanced) or 'NO' if `f` is non-zero (indicating at least one non-zero difference, meaning the array cannot be balanced). This process is repeated for each test case.
