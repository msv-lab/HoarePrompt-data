Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels in all containers through the allowed operations. The key insight here is that if the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, then it is always possible to equalize the water levels by moving water between containers.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function reads from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of containers (`n`) and the amounts of water in each container (`a`).
   - It calculates the target water level `u` which is the average water level, i.e., `sum(a) // len(a)`.
   - It initializes two variables `d` and `f`. `d` is used to track the difference between the current sum of water and the target sum, while `f` is a flag that checks if any intermediate state results in a non-zero difference.
   - The program iterates over the water levels in each container, updating `d` by adding the difference between the current water level and the target water level.
   - If at any point `d` becomes non-zero, `f` is set to `True`, indicating that it's impossible to equalize the water levels because there would be an imbalance.
   - Finally, the program prints "YES" if `f` is `False` (meaning it's possible to equalize the water levels) and "NO" otherwise.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly checks if the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, ensuring that it is theoretically possible to equalize the water levels.
   - The program correctly identifies if there is any intermediate state where the water distribution cannot be balanced, using the flag `f`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
