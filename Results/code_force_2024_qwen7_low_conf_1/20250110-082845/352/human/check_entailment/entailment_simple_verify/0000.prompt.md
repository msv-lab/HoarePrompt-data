You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        a = (*map(int, s.split()),)
        u = sum(a) // len(a)
        d = f = 0
        for x in a:
            d += x - u
            f |= d
        print('YNEOS'[f < 0::2])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. It is also guaranteed that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

            d += x - u
            f |= d

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a tuple of integers derived from the input, `u` is the arithmetic mean of the elements in `a`, `d` is the sum of all differences between each element in `a` and the arithmetic mean `u`, `f` is the bitwise OR of all non-zero values of `d` encountered during the loop, the output is 'YES' if `f` is 0 or 'NO' if `f` is non-zero.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here’s a brief analysis:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads input from stdin and processes it correctly.
2. **Calculating Target Amount**: It calculates the target amount of water per container by dividing the total sum of water by the number of containers (`u = sum(a) // len(a)`).
3. **Checking Feasibility**: It iterates through the array of water amounts and checks if the cumulative difference `d` can ever be negative. If `d` becomes negative, it indicates that it's impossible to balance the water across all containers without violating the condition that water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a higher index. The bitwise OR operation (`f |= d`) ensures that as soon as `d` becomes negative, `f` becomes 1, indicating that it's not possible to balance the water.

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program handles all cases correctly. There is no scenario where the program would fail to produce the correct output based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
