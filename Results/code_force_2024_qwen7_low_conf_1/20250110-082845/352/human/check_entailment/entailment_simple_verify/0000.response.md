### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We have \( n \) containers of water, each containing \( a_i \) units of water.
- The sum of \( a_i \) is divisible by \( n \).
- We can pour water from any container \( i \) to any container \( j \) where \( i < j \).
- The goal is to determine if we can make the amount of water in all containers equal.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:
       a = *map(int, s.split()),
   ```
   - The program reads the input from stdin.
   - `[*open(0)]` reads all lines from stdin.
   - `[*open(0)][2::2]` skips the first two lines (containing `t` and `n`) and processes every second line.
   - `*map(int, s.split())` splits each line into individual numbers and converts them to integers.

2. **Calculating Target Amount**:
   ```python
   u = sum(a) // len(a)
   ```
   - `u` is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the water amounts in the containers.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   ```python
   d = f = 0
   for x in a:
       d += x - u
       f |= d
   ```
   - `d` is initialized to 0 and represents the cumulative difference from the target amount.
   - `f` is initialized to 0 and is used to check if the cumulative difference ever becomes negative.
   - `f |= d` performs a bitwise OR operation, which sets `f` to 1 if `d` is non-zero at any point.
   - If `d` ever becomes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the target amount without violating the pouring constraint (since `i < j`).

4. **Output Determination**:
   ```python
   print('YNEOS'[f < 0::2])
   ```
   - `'YNEOS'[f < 0::2]` checks if `f` is 0 or non-zero.
     - If `f` is 0, it prints "YES".
     - If `f` is non-zero, it prints "NO".

#### Correctness Analysis

1. **Target Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `u` (target amount) is correct and necessary for determining if the water amounts can be balanced.

2. **Cumulative Difference Check**:
   - The use of `d` to track the cumulative difference and `f` to detect if it becomes negative is sound. If `d` ever becomes negative, it indicates that it's impossible to balance the water amounts due to the constraint of pouring from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the output is correct. If `f` remains 0 throughout the iteration, it means the water amounts can be balanced; otherwise, they cannot.

#### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input, calculates the target amount, checks if the cumulative difference ever becomes negative, and outputs the correct result.

Final: **True**
