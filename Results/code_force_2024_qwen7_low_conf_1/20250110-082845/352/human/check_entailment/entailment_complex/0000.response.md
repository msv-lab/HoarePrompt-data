Reasoning:
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers through the specified operations. Given the constraints, the key insight is that if the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, it is always possible to balance the water distribution by pouring water from one container to another until they all have the same amount.
2. **Algorithm Insight**: The solution leverages the fact that the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers since the sum of the water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). This means each container should end up with the average amount of water, `u = sum(a) // len(a)`.
3. **Implementation Check**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the mean `u` of the water distribution.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, calculating the cumulative deviation from the mean `u` (`d`).
   - The variable `f` keeps track of whether there is any deviation from the mean by performing a bitwise OR operation on the deviations.
   - If `f` is zero after processing all elements, it means no deviations exist, and the distribution is already even, so the answer is 'YES'. Otherwise, it's 'NO'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement, including the maximum number of test cases and the maximum number of containers.

Based on the analysis, the program logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
