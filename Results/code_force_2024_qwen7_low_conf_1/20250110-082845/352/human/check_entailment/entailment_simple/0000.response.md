Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operations. Here's why:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires determining if the sum of water units in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, which is guaranteed to be true in the input. The goal is to check if it's possible to make the water distribution uniform across all containers.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial water distribution `a`.
   - It calculates the arithmetic mean `u` of the water units, which is the target amount of water each container should have to make the distribution uniform.
   - It iterates through the water units in `a`, accumulating the difference `d` between each unit and the mean `u`.
   - The variable `f` is used to store the bitwise OR of all non-zero values of `d`. If `d` becomes non-zero at any point, it means it's impossible to balance the containers to the exact mean without some containers having extra water and others lacking, which violates the condition of making all amounts equal.
   - Finally, it prints "YES" if `f` is 0 (meaning all differences can be balanced out) and "NO" if `f` is non-zero (indicating some imbalance).

3. **Guaranteed Conditions**: The problem guarantees that the sum of water units in each test case is divisible by `n`, ensuring the mean `u` is an integer. Thus, the program correctly handles this condition.

4. **Output Format**: The program outputs "YES" or "NO" in the required format, matching the problem's output specification.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and adheres to the problem description, it is correct.
