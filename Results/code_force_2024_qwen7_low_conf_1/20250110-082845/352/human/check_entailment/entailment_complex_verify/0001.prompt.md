You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a tuple of integers derived from the input, `u` is the arithmetic mean of the elements in `a`, `d` is the sum of all differences between each element in `a` and the arithmetic mean `u`, `f` is the bitwise OR of all non-zero values of `d` encountered during the loop, the output is 'YES' if `f` is 0 or 'NO' if `f` is non-zero.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases via standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `t` (number of test cases) followed by pairs of lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (number of elements in the array), and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, the function calculates the arithmetic mean `u` of the elements in the array `a`. It then computes the sum of the absolute differences between each element and the mean `u`, stored in `d`, and performs a bitwise OR operation on all non-zero values of `d`, stored in `f`. Finally, the function prints 'YES' if `f` is 0 (indicating all differences are zero, meaning the array can be balanced) or 'NO' if `f` is non-zero (indicating at least one non-zero difference, meaning the array cannot be balanced). This process is repeated for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels in all containers through the allowed operations. The key insight here is that if the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, then it is always possible to equalize the water levels by moving water between containers.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function reads from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of containers (`n`) and the amounts of water in each container (`a`).
   - It calculates the target water level `u` which is the average water level, i.e., `sum(a) // len(a)`.
   - It initializes two variables `d` and `f`. `d` is used to track the difference between the current sum of water and the target sum, while `f` is a flag that checks if any intermediate state results in a non-zero difference.
   - The program iterates over the water levels in each container, updating `d` by adding the difference between the current water level and the target water level.
   - If at any point `d` becomes non-zero, `f` is set to `True`, indicating that it's impossible to equalize the water levels because there would be an imbalance.
   - Finally, the program prints "YES" if `f` is `False` (meaning it's possible to equalize the water levels) and "NO" otherwise.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly checks if the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, ensuring that it is theoretically possible to equalize the water levels.
   - The program correctly identifies if there is any intermediate state where the water distribution cannot be balanced, using the flag `f`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
