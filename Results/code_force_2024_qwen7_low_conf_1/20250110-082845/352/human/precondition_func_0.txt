t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. It is also guaranteed that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
