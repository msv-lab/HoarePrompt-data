t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 and represents the length of the binary string s, s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', and func_1 is a function that takes n and s as inputs and returns the maximum integer k (1 <= k <= n) for which it is possible to make all the characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations.
