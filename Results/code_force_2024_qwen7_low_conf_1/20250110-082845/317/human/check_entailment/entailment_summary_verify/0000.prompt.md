You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A binary string s of length n is given. A binary string is a string consisting
only of the characters '1' and '0'.

You can choose an integer k (1 \le k \le n ) and then apply the following
operation any number of times: choose k consecutive characters of the string
and invert them, i.e., replace all '0' with '1' and vice versa.

Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string
equal to '1'.

For example, if n=5 , s=00100 , you can choose k=3 and proceed as follows:

  * choose the substring from the 1 -st to the 3 -rd character and obtain s=\color{blue}{110}00 ; 
  * choose the substring from the 3 -rd to the 5 -th character and obtain s=11\color{blue}{111} ; 

Find the maximum value of k for which it is possible to make all the
characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations. Note
that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) —
the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n , consisting
of the characters '1' and '0'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n^2 over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 25 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum integer k (1 \le k \le n ) for which it
is possible to obtain a string s consisting only of the characters '1' using
the described operations.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, s):
    zero_count = s.count('0')
    if zero_count == 0:
        return n
    max_k = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if zero_count % k == 0:
            max_k = k
    return max_k

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        result = func_1(n, s)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calls the function `func_1` with `n` and `s` as arguments to determine the maximum integer `k` for which it is possible to make all characters in the string `s` equal to '1' using certain operations. The function collects the results for all test cases in a list `results` and prints each result exactly once. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats, where `n` is outside the range `[1, 5000]` or `s` is not a valid binary string. If such cases occur, the function will handle them according to the behavior of `func_1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum value of `k` based on the number of zeros in the string, but it does not account for the actual sequence of zeros and ones in the string. The logic used to determine `max_k` based solely on the count of zeros is insufficient.

Consider the test case `n=7, s=1011101`. The correct answer should be `4`, as we can choose the substring from the 2nd to the 5th character (`0111`) and invert it to get `1100101`, and then choose the substring from the 3rd to the 6th character (`10010`) and invert it to get `1111111`. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return `1` because it only checks if the number of zeros is divisible by `k`.

To correctly solve this problem, the function needs to check if it's possible to convert all zeros to ones by inverting any substring of length `k`. This requires a more complex algorithm that considers the positions of zeros in the string.
