Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic within `func_1` and `func_2` does not accurately determine the maximum value of \( k \) for which it is possible to make all characters in the string '1' using the allowed operations. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum \( k \) such that the count of '0's (`zero_count`) is divisible by \( k \). However, this approach does not guarantee that all '0's can be flipped to '1's using the described operations.
   - For instance, consider the string `00100`. The count of '0's is 3. The function would find that \( k = 3 \) satisfies `3 % 3 == 0`, but this does not mean that flipping every 3 consecutive characters can result in a string of all '1's. In this case, flipping the middle 3 characters results in `11111`, which is correct, but flipping different segments might not work.

2. **Insufficient Handling of Cases:**
   - The program does not account for cases where multiple segments of '0's need to be flipped in a coordinated manner. It only checks divisibility without considering the actual sequence of flips required.
   - For example, in the string `01000`, the function correctly outputs `2`, but it does not check if flipping the first two characters (`01000 -> 11000`) followed by flipping the last three (`11000 -> 11111`) is possible. This approach is missing.

3. **Lack of Detailed Algorithm:**
   - The solution should involve more detailed steps to ensure that the entire string can be transformed into a string of all '1's. The current implementation lacks the necessary logic to handle complex cases effectively.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the algorithm should:
- Identify the longest segment of '0's that can be flipped at once.
- Check if flipping this segment and other smaller segments can transform the entire string into a string of '1's.

A more appropriate approach would involve:
1. Identifying the longest segment of '0's.
2. Checking if flipping this segment and any remaining '0's can achieve the desired result.
3. Ensuring that the flips do not interfere with each other.

Since the provided solution does not correctly implement this logic, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
