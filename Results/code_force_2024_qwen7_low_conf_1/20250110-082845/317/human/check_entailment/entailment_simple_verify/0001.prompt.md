You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A binary string s of length n is given. A binary string is a string consisting
only of the characters '1' and '0'.

You can choose an integer k (1 \le k \le n ) and then apply the following
operation any number of times: choose k consecutive characters of the string
and invert them, i.e., replace all '0' with '1' and vice versa.

Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string
equal to '1'.

For example, if n=5 , s=00100 , you can choose k=3 and proceed as follows:

  * choose the substring from the 1 -st to the 3 -rd character and obtain s=\color{blue}{110}00 ; 
  * choose the substring from the 3 -rd to the 5 -th character and obtain s=11\color{blue}{111} ; 

Find the maximum value of k for which it is possible to make all the
characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations. Note
that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) —
the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n , consisting
of the characters '1' and '0'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n^2 over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 25 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum integer k (1 \le k \le n ) for which it
is possible to obtain a string s consisting only of the characters '1' using
the described operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest `k` such that by inverting substrings of length `k`, we can turn the entire string into '1's.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It first checks if the string `s` already consists entirely of '1's. If so, it returns `n`.
   - It then iterates through all possible lengths `k` from 1 to `n` and checks if the number of '0's in the string is divisible by `k`. This is because each `k`-length substring inversion must be able to cover all '0's evenly.
   - The function returns the largest `k` that satisfies the condition.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the total number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` and the string `s`, then calls `func_1` to get the result and stores it.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the largest `k` that allows for the transformation of the string into '1's by checking divisibility conditions.
  - The loop checks all possible `k` values up to `n`, ensuring the largest valid `k` is found.
  - The condition `zero_count % k == 0` ensures that the `k`-length substrings can cover all '0's evenly.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The function correctly reads input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` appropriately.
  - It handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all inputs at once and processing them in a loop.

Given that both functions follow the logic described in the problem statement and handle inputs correctly, the provided program is **correct**.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
