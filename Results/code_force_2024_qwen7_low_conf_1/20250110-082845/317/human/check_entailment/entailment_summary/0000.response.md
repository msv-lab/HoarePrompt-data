Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum integer \( k \) such that we can make all characters in a given binary string equal to '1' by inverting \( k \)-length substrings. The solution involves processing multiple test cases, each with its own binary string and length.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly identifies the largest \( k \) such that the number of '0's in the string is divisible by \( k \). This is necessary because inverting a substring can effectively remove all '0's in chunks of size \( k \). If the count of '0's is not divisible by \( k \), it is impossible to make all characters '1'.
   - **func_2**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each one by calling `func_1`, and prints the results. It handles the overall structure of reading multiple test cases and processing each one individually.

Given that:
- `func_1` correctly identifies the largest \( k \) for each binary string.
- `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` appropriately.

The program as a whole correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
