Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum integer \( k \) (where \( 1 \le k \le n \)) such that the count of '0's in the string \( s \) is divisible by \( k \).
   - If the string \( s \) does not contain any '0's, the function immediately returns \( n \), as making all characters '1' is trivial in this case.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through possible values of \( k \) and checks if the count of '0's is divisible by \( k \). It updates `max_k` accordingly.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the maximum \( k \) that allows the transformation to a string of all '1's, given the constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases \( t \), followed by pairs of lines for each test case, containing \( n \) and the binary string \( s \).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, s)` and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the list.
   - The handling of input and output, as well as the processing of multiple test cases, is correctly implemented.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Given that both `func_1` and `func_2` implement the logic described in the problem statement accurately and handle the inputs and outputs correctly, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
