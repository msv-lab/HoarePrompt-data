Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum value of `k` based on the number of zeros in the string, but it does not account for the actual sequence of zeros and ones in the string. The logic used to determine `max_k` based solely on the count of zeros is insufficient.

Consider the test case `n=7, s=1011101`. The correct answer should be `4`, as we can choose the substring from the 2nd to the 5th character (`0111`) and invert it to get `1100101`, and then choose the substring from the 3rd to the 6th character (`10010`) and invert it to get `1111111`. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return `1` because it only checks if the number of zeros is divisible by `k`.

To correctly solve this problem, the function needs to check if it's possible to convert all zeros to ones by inverting any substring of length `k`. This requires a more complex algorithm that considers the positions of zeros in the string.
