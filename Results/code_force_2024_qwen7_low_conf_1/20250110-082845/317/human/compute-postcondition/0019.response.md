`s` is reassigned the value of `data[index + 1]`. Since `index` is 6, `data[index + 1]` corresponds to `data[7]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[6])`, `s` is `data[7]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 6, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration.**
