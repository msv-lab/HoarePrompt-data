The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `func_1`, and `input` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and the new assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 and represents the length of the binary string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs and returns the maximum integer `k` (1 <= k <= n) for which it is possible to make all the characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations, and `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace.**
