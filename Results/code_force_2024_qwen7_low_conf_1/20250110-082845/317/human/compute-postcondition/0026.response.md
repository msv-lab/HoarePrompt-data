According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `res` and the list `results`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, the statement `print(res)` is executed, and the value of `res` is printed. This means that the loop has processed one element from the `results` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the `results` list must be available and assigned to `res`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `res` is set to the next element in the `results` list.

State: **`res` is the next element in the `results` list**
