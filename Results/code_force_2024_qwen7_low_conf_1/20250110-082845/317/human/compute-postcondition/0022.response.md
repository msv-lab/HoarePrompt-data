The code appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, and `n` and `s` are defined as `int(data[6])` and `data[7]` respectively, the value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(int(data[6]), data[7])`. 

Therefore, `results` now contains two elements: the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the first iteration and the return value of `func_1(int(data[6]), data[7])` for the current iteration. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[6])`, `s` is `data[7]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 8, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration, `results` is `[results[0], func_1(int(data[6]), data[7])]**
