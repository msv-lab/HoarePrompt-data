The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly but refers to `t`, `n`, and `s` which are defined outside its scope. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 and represents the length of the binary string `s`, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The function `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs and returns the maximum integer `k` (1 <= k <= n) for which it is possible to make all the characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept the integer `t`, and for each test case, it uses the function `func_1` to determine the maximum integer `k` for the given binary string `s` and returns the result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, and for each test case, it uses the function `func_1` to determine the maximum integer `k` for the given binary string `s` and returns the result for each test case.**
