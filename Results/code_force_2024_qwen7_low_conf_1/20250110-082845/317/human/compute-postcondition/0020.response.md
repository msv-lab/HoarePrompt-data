The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `index` was 6, so after incrementing by 2, `index` becomes 8. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[6])`, `s` is `data[7]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 8, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration.
