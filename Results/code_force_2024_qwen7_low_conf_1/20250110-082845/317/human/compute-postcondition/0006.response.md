`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is taken as an input and converted to an integer. The variable `n` now holds this integer value, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
