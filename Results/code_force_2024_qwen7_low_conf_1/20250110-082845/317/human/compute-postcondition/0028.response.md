According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `res`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is the next element in the `results` list, and the output is the value of `res`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must be the next element in the `results` list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `res` points to the next element in the `results` list.

State: **`res` is the next element in the `results` list**
