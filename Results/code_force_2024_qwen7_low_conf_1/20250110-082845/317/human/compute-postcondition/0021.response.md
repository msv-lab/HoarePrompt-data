The code assigns the return value of `func_1(n, s)` to `result`. Since `n` is `int(data[6])` and `s` is `data[7]`, the function `func_1` is called with these arguments in both the first and current iteration, and its return value is stored in `result`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[6])`, `s` is `data[7]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 8, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration, `result` is equal to the return value of `func_1(int(data[6]), data[7])`**.
