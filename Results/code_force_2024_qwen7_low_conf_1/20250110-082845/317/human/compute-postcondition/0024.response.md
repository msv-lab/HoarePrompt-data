Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The loop variable `res` takes each element of `results` one by one.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `results`**:
   - `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration of the loop.
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. This means that the loop body must run at least once.

3. **Identify the Variables and Their States**:
   - `t`: A positive integer.
   - `n`: The integer value of `data[index - t]`.
   - `s`: The value of `data[index - t + 1]`.
   - `func_1`: A function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs.
   - `data`: A list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace.
   - `index`: The value `2 * t + 1`.
   - `results`: A list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `result`: The return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the last iteration of the loop.

4. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - Since `results` is a list and the loop iterates over its elements, `results` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The initial conditions of `t`, `n`, `s`, and the construction of `data` and `index` are given but do not directly impact the loop execution (they determine what gets added to `results`).

5. **Final State for the Loop Execution**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, `results` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `results` contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`results` must have at least one element.**
