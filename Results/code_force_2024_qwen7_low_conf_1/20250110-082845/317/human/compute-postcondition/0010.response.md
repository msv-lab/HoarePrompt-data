The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, where `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and `s` is the value of `data[2]`. Since the exact return value of `func_1` is not specified, we keep it as `result`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[2]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 3, `results` is a list with one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`**
