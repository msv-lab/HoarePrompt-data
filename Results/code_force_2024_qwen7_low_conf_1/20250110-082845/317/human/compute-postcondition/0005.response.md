To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the for loop and their initial states.

1. **`t`**: The variable `t` is defined as `data[0]`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer since the loop runs `t` times. Given that `t` is initialized to `data[0]`, if `data[0]` is a valid positive integer, the loop will execute.

2. **`n`**: The variable `n` is defined as an integer such that `1 <= n <= 5000` and represents the length of the binary string `s`. This value does not directly impact the loop's execution but ensures that the string `s` is of valid length.

3. **`s`**: The string `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. This value is not directly checked within the loop but is necessary for the function `func_1`.

4. **`func_1`**: The function `func_1` takes `n` and `s` as inputs and returns the maximum integer `k` (1 <= k <= n) for which it is possible to make all the characters in the string `s` equal to '1' using the described operations. This function's return value is not directly relevant to the loop's execution but is used inside the loop body.

5. **`data`**: The list `data` is obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace. The first element `data[0]` is used to initialize `t`, ensuring it is a positive integer for the loop to run.

6. **`index`**: The variable `index` is set to 1, which might be part of some external logic but does not directly affect the loop's execution.

7. **`results`**: The list `results` is initially empty and is used to store results during the loop iterations. Its initial state is not critical for the loop's execution but is important for storing results.

Given these points, the primary variable to adjust for the loop to execute is `t`, which must be a positive integer.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**.
