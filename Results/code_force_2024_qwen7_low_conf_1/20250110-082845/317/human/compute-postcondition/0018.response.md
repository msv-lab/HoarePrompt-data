`n` is reassigned the value of `int(data[index])`. Since `index` is 6, `n` is now `int(data[6])`. The value of `data[4]` remains unchanged because it was not involved in this assignment. The states of the other variables (`s`, `func_1`, `data`, `index`, `results`, and `result`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[6])`, `s` is the value of `data[5]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 6, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration.**
