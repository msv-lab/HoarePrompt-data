Output State: **`res` is the last element in the `results` list, and the loop prints each element of the `results` list exactly once.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it.
- After the loop finishes executing, `res` will hold the last element of the `results` list because the loop processes each element sequentially.
- Since the loop prints each element exactly once, there are no additional constraints on the variables other than the requirement that `results` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `results` is an empty list), then:
- `res` will be undefined (or could be considered as `None` if the context allows it).
- No elements will be printed.
