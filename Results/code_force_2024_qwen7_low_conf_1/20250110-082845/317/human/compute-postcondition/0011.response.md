Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `s` is the value of `data[2]`.
   - `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs.
   - `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace.
   - `index` is 3.
   - `results` is a list with one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is specified by `range(t)`, meaning the loop will run `t` times.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - Each iteration of the loop runs once, regardless of the values of `n`, `s`, or `func_1`.

4. **Variables at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is defined by `range(t)`, the only thing that changes between iterations is the index of the `results` list. The value of `t` remains constant, but the index used to access elements in `results` and `data` will change.
   - After the first iteration, `index` was 3, so for the next iteration, `index` will be incremented by 1 (assuming it increments automatically within the loop).
   - Therefore, `index` will be 4 in the next iteration.
   - `results` will have another element added, and `result` will be updated to the new value returned by `func_1(n, s)` for this new `n` and `s`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` and `s` remain unchanged because they are based on `data[index]` and `data[2]`, which do not change per iteration.
   - `func_1` remains unchanged.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `index` is incremented to 4.
   - `results` now has two elements, and `result` is the latest return value of `func_1(n, s)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[2]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 4, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration**.
