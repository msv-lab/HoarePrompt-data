The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `index` is 4, so after incrementing, `index` becomes 6. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `s` is the value of `data[5]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 6, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `s` is the value of `data[5]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 6, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration.**
