`s` is reassigned the value of `data[index + 1]`. Given that `index` is 1, this means `s` is now assigned the value of `data[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[2]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
