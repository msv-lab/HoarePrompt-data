The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `s`. Given that `index` is 4, `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[5]`. The value of `data[5]` is the new value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `s` is the value of `data[5]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 4, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration**
