The given code initializes an empty list `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `func_1`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 and represents the length of the binary string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs and returns the maximum integer `k` (1 <= k <= n) for which it is possible to make all the characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
