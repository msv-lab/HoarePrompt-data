`n` is reassigned the value of `int(data[index])`. Given that `index` is 4, `n` is set to the integer value of `data[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `s` is the value of `data[2]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 4, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration**
