Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - t]`, `s` is the value of `data[index - t + 1]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the last iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Since the loop runs exactly `t` times, `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`n` and `s`**: These are set inside the loop, and their values change with each iteration. Specifically, `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index]`, and `s` is set to `data[index + 1]`. After `t` iterations, `n` and `s` take the values from `data[index - t]` and `data[index - t + 1]` respectively, where `index` is `2 * t + 1`.
- **`func_1`**: This function remains unchanged as it is defined outside the loop.
- **`data`**: This list remains unchanged as it is defined outside the loop.
- **`index`**: Initially, `index` is set to 1, and it increases by 2 after each iteration. Therefore, after `t` iterations, `index` becomes `2 * t + 1`.
- **`results`**: The `results` list accumulates the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration. After `t` iterations, `results` contains `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the corresponding iteration.
- **`result`**: This is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the last iteration, which is the `t`th iteration.

If the loop does not execute (`t` is 0), then:
- `t` is 0.
- `n` and `s` retain their original values from the initial state.
- `index` is 1.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `result` is undefined or can be considered as an empty value.
