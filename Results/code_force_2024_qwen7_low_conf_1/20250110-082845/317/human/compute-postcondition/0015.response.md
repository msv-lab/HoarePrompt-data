The code `result = func_1(n, s)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(n, s)` to the variable `result`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and the other variables' states are not directly affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `s` is the value of `data[5]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 6, `results` is a list with two elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for the first and current iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the current iteration, and `result` is assigned the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.**
