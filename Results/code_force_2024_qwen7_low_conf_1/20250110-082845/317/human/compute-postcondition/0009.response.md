The function `func_1` is called with `n` and `s` as arguments. The return value of `func_1(n, s)` is assigned to `result`. The values of `n` and `s` are unchanged, but now `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, s)`. The other variables remain in their original states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[2]`, `func_1` is a function that takes `n` and `s` as inputs, `data` is a list obtained from splitting a line of input on whitespace, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`**
