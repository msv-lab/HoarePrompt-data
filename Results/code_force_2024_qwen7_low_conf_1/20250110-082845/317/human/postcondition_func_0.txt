The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the binary string `s`) and `s` (a binary string consisting only of '0' and '1' of length `n`). The function calculates the count of '0's in the string `s` and then finds the largest integer `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`) such that the count of zeros (`zero_count`) is divisible by `k`. If no such `k` exists, the function returns `1`.
