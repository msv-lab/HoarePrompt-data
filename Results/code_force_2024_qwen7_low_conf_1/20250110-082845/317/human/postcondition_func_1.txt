The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calls the function `func_1` with `n` and `s` as arguments to determine the maximum integer `k` for which it is possible to make all characters in the string `s` equal to '1' using certain operations. The function collects the results for all test cases in a list `results` and prints each result exactly once. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats, where `n` is outside the range `[1, 5000]` or `s` is not a valid binary string. If such cases occur, the function will handle them according to the behavior of `func_1`.
