The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and its length is at most 5000. It iterates over possible lengths of substrings `d` and checks for valid pairs within these substrings using the helper function `func_2`. For each valid pair, it updates the count of matching pairs. It then adjusts the count based on the sliding window approach. If the count equals `d`, it updates `max_length` to the maximum value found during the loop. Finally, the function returns `max_length`, which represents the maximum length of valid substrings found during the process. Potential edge cases include when the input string `s` is empty or contains only question marks, in which case `max_length` would be 0. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `s` might contain characters other than lowercase Latin letters and question marks, though this is not explicitly stated in the problem description.
