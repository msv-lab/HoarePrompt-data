Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` attempts to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat in the string by iterating through possible half-lengths `d`. However, the logic inside the function does not properly update the count of matching characters to account for the replacement of question marks with appropriate lowercase letters. Specifically, the inner loop that tries to shift the window and update the count of matching characters does not correctly handle the scenario where replacing question marks could potentially create a longer tandem repeat.

To illustrate, consider the input `"code?????s"`. The program would initially attempt to find tandem repeats without considering the replacements of question marks. It would miss the opportunity to form a longer tandem repeat by replacing the question marks appropriately. For instance, replacing the question marks with 'e' and 's' respectively to form `"codesess"` would result in a tandem repeat of length 10, but the current implementation cannot achieve this.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of maximizing the length of the longest tandem repeat substring by replacing each question mark optimally.
