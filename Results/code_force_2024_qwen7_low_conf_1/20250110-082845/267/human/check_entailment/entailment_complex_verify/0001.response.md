### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring in the given string `s`.
   - It iterates through possible lengths `d` of the first half of a potential tandem repeat, where `d` ranges from 1 to `n // 2` (since the string length must be even).
   - For each `d`, it counts the number of positions where the characters at distance `d` apart match.
   - This count is adjusted as the window slides through the string to check for tandem repeats.
   - If the count matches `d`, it means the substring can form a tandem repeat of length `2 * d`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This helper function checks if two characters `a` and `b` can be considered matching in the context of a tandem repeat.
   - It returns `True` if both characters are the same, if one character is a question mark (`?`), or if both characters are question marks.
   - This logic ensures that a question mark can be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat.

3. **Handling Question Marks**:
   - The function correctly handles question marks by allowing them to be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat.
   - When a question mark is encountered, it can be replaced by any character to match the corresponding position in the tandem repeat.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The function updates `max_length` whenever it finds a longer tandem repeat and returns the maximum length found.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, we can identify a flaw in the implementation. Specifically, the function `func_1` is checking for tandem repeats but not actually replacing the question marks in the string. Instead, it is simply counting the potential tandem repeats based on the current state of the string, which includes question marks.

The critical issue is that the function does not modify the string `s` at all; it only counts the potential tandem repeats. This means that the function will only return the length of the longest potential tandem repeat that could exist in the string, without actually ensuring that question marks are replaced to maximize the tandem repeat length.

To correctly solve the problem, the function needs to ensure that question marks are replaced optimally to form the longest tandem repeat. The current implementation does not achieve this.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not actually replace the question marks in the string to maximize the tandem repeat length. It only counts the potential tandem repeats, which may not reflect the actual maximum length achievable after replacing the question marks optimally.
