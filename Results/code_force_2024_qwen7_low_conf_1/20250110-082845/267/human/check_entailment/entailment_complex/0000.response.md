Reasoning:
- The main function `func_1` aims to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat. It iterates over possible lengths of substrings `d` and checks for valid pairs within these substrings using the helper function `func_2`.
- `func_2` correctly identifies whether two characters `a` and `b` form a valid pair, considering the possibility of `a` or `b` being a question mark (`?`).
- The core logic in `func_1` uses a sliding window approach to adjust the count of matching pairs as it slides through the string. If the count equals `d`, it updates `max_length` to the maximum value found during the loop.
- Edge cases are handled appropriately, such as when the input string `s` is empty or contains only question marks, in which case `max_length` would be 0.
- The program iterates over each test case and prints the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring for each input string `s`.
- The overall logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all specified conditions and constraints.

Given this analysis, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
