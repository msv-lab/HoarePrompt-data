Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires replacing each '?' in the input string with a lowercase Latin letter to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly handles the comparison between characters, including '?' which acts as a wildcard. It ensures that the comparison logic is robust and covers all possible cases (matching characters, '?' matching any character, and '?' being itself).
3. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function iterates over possible halves (`d`) of potential tandem repeat substrings.
   - It uses `func_2` to check if the corresponding characters in the first half match the characters in the second half.
   - The function employs a sliding window approach to efficiently update the count of matching pairs without recomputing the entire substring.
   - If the count of matching pairs equals `d`, it updates `max_length` to the maximum value found during the loop.
4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - When the input string `s` is empty or contains only question marks, the function correctly identifies `max_length` as 0.
   - The function correctly handles strings containing lowercase Latin letters and '?'.
5. **Total Functionality**: Both functions work together to solve the problem accurately by ensuring that each '?' is optimally replaced to form the longest possible tandem repeat substring.

Given the detailed execution summaries and the correct handling of all aspects of the problem, the given program appears to be correct.
