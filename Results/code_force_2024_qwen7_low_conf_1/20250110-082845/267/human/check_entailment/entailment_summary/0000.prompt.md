You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        result = func_1(s)
        print(result)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    for d in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        count = sum((1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d])))
        for l in range(n - 2 * d):
            if l > 0:
                count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])
                count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])
            if count == d:
                max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)
    return max_length
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and its length is at most 5000. It iterates over possible lengths of substrings `d` and checks for valid pairs within these substrings using the helper function `func_2`. For each valid pair, it updates the count of matching pairs. It then adjusts the count based on the sliding window approach. If the count equals `d`, it updates `max_length` to the maximum value found during the loop. Finally, the function returns `max_length`, which represents the maximum length of valid substrings found during the process. Potential edge cases include when the input string `s` is empty or contains only question marks, in which case `max_length` would be 0. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `s` might contain characters other than lowercase Latin letters and question marks, though this is not explicitly stated in the problem description.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a, b):
    return a == b or a == '?' or b == '?'
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which can be lowercase Latin letters or the character `'?'`. It returns `True` if either `a` equals `b`, or if `a` is `'?'`, or if `b` is `'?'`. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `False`. This covers all possible cases for the inputs `a` and `b`.
