Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring in the given string `s`.
   - It iterates through possible lengths `d` of the first half of a potential tandem repeat, where `d` ranges from 1 to `n // 2` (since the string length must be even).
   - For each `d`, it counts the number of positions where the characters at distance `d` apart match.
   - This count is adjusted as the window slides through the string to check for tandem repeats.
   - If the count matches `d`, it means the substring can form a tandem repeat of length `2 * d`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This helper function checks if two characters `a` and `b` can be considered matching in the context of a tandem repeat.
   - It returns `True` if both characters are the same, if one character is a question mark (`?`), or if both characters are question marks.
   - This logic ensures that a question mark can be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat.

3. **Handling Question Marks**:
   - The function correctly handles question marks by allowing them to be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat.
   - When a question mark is encountered, it can be replaced by any character to match the corresponding position in the tandem repeat.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The function updates `max_length` whenever it finds a longer tandem repeat and returns the maximum length found.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program should correctly compute the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
