You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    for d in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        count = sum((1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d])))
        for l in range(n - 2 * d):
            if l > 0:
                count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])
                count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])
            if count == d:
                max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)
    return max_length

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a == b or a == '?' or b == '?'



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which can be lowercase Latin letters or the character `'?'`. It returns `True` if either `a` equals `b`, or if `a` is `'?'`, or if `b` is `'?'`. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `False`. This covers all possible cases for the inputs `a` and `b`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` attempts to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat in the string by iterating through possible half-lengths `d`. However, the logic inside the function does not properly update the count of matching characters to account for the replacement of question marks with appropriate lowercase letters. Specifically, the inner loop that tries to shift the window and update the count of matching characters does not correctly handle the scenario where replacing question marks could potentially create a longer tandem repeat.

To illustrate, consider the input `"code?????s"`. The program would initially attempt to find tandem repeats without considering the replacements of question marks. It would miss the opportunity to form a longer tandem repeat by replacing the question marks appropriately. For instance, replacing the question marks with 'e' and 's' respectively to form `"codesess"` would result in a tandem repeat of length 10, but the current implementation cannot achieve this.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of maximizing the length of the longest tandem repeat substring by replacing each question mark optimally.
