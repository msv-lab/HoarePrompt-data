You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    for d in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        count = sum((1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d])))
        for l in range(n - 2 * d):
            if l > 0:
                count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])
                count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])
            if count == d:
                max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)
    return max_length

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a == b or a == '?' or b == '?'



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which can be lowercase Latin letters or the character `'?'`. It returns `True` if either `a` equals `b`, or if `a` is `'?'`, or if `b` is `'?'`. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `False`. This covers all possible cases for the inputs `a` and `b`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring in the given string `s`.
   - It iterates through possible lengths `d` of the first half of a potential tandem repeat, where `d` ranges from 1 to `n // 2` (since the string length must be even).
   - For each `d`, it counts the number of positions where the characters at distance `d` apart match.
   - This count is adjusted as the window slides through the string to check for tandem repeats.
   - If the count matches `d`, it means the substring can form a tandem repeat of length `2 * d`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This helper function checks if two characters `a` and `b` can be considered matching in the context of a tandem repeat.
   - It returns `True` if both characters are the same, if one character is a question mark (`?`), or if both characters are question marks.
   - This logic ensures that a question mark can be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat.

3. **Handling Question Marks**:
   - The function correctly handles question marks by allowing them to be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat.
   - When a question mark is encountered, it can be replaced by any character to match the corresponding position in the tandem repeat.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The function updates `max_length` whenever it finds a longer tandem repeat and returns the maximum length found.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program should correctly compute the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
