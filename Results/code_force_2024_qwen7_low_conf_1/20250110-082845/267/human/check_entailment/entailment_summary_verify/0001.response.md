### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring in the given string `s`.
   - It iterates through possible lengths `d` of the first half of a potential tandem repeat, where `d` ranges from 1 to `n // 2` (since the string length must be even).
   - For each `d`, it counts the number of positions where the characters at distance `d` apart match using `func_2`.
   - The `count` variable is used to keep track of the number of matching pairs in the current window of size `2*d`.
   - If `count` matches `d`, it means the substring can form a tandem repeat of length `2*d`.
   - The function updates `max_length` with the maximum length of the tandem repeat found so far.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This helper function checks if two characters `a` and `b` can be considered matching in the context of a tandem repeat.
   - It returns `True` if both characters are the same, if one character is a question mark (`?`), or if both characters are question marks.
   - This logic ensures that a question mark can be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat, which is crucial for handling the input string that contains question marks.

3. **Handling Question Marks**:
   - The function correctly handles question marks by allowing them to be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat.
   - When a question mark is encountered, it can be replaced by any character to match the corresponding position in the tandem repeat, ensuring that the tandem repeat condition is satisfied.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The function updates `max_length` whenever it finds a longer tandem repeat and returns the maximum length found.
   - The sliding window approach in `func_1` ensures that all possible tandem repeats are checked, and the question marks are handled appropriately to maximize the length of the tandem repeat.

### Evaluation:

- The original assessment correctly identified that the program aims to find the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring, and it correctly handles question marks by allowing them to be replaced by any character.
- The function `func_1` uses a sliding window approach to check for tandem repeats and correctly updates the maximum length found.
- The function `func_2` ensures that question marks can be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat, which is essential for the correct functioning of `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately solves the problem as described.
