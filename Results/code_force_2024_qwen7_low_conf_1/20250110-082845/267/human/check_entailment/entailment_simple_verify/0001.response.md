### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring in the given string `s`.
   - The main loop iterates over possible lengths `d` of the first half of a potential tandem repeat, ranging from 1 to `n // 2`.
   - For each `d`, it uses the `func_2` function to count the number of positions where characters at distance `d` apart match.
   - The count is adjusted as the window slides through the string to check for tandem repeats.
   - If the count matches `d`, it indicates that a tandem repeat of length `2 * d` can be formed at that position.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This helper function checks if two characters `a` and `b` can be considered matching in the context of a tandem repeat.
   - It returns `True` if both characters are the same, if one character is a question mark (`?`), or if both characters are question marks.
   - This logic allows question marks to be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat.

3. **Handling Question Marks**:
   - The function correctly handles question marks by allowing them to be replaced by any character to form a tandem repeat.
   - When a question mark is encountered, it can be replaced by any character to match the corresponding position in the tandem repeat.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The function updates `max_length` whenever it finds a longer tandem repeat and returns the maximum length found.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, we notice a critical flaw in the approach used by `func_1`. Specifically, the logic for counting and adjusting the `count` variable is flawed. The annotations suggest that the `count` is being updated incorrectly, leading to incorrect results.

### Key Issue:
- The `count` variable is intended to track the number of valid matches for a given `d`. However, the logic for updating `count` is incorrect. The current implementation subtracts and adds values based on the sliding window but does not correctly handle the transitions between valid and invalid states.

### Detailed Analysis:
- When `l > 0`, the code attempts to adjust the `count` by subtracting the match at position `l - 1` and adding the match at position `l + d - 1`. This adjustment is supposed to reflect the sliding window, but the logic is flawed because it does not properly account for the cumulative effect of question marks and their replacements.

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a more robust approach to ensure that we correctly handle the question marks and find the longest possible tandem repeat. One effective method is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the longest tandem repeat ending at each position.

### Conclusion:
Given the flaws in the current implementation, particularly in how `count` is updated, the program does not correctly compute the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
