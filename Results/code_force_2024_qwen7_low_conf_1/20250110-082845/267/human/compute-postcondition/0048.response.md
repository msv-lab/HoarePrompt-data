Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `d` from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`.
   - `max_length` is the maximum value found during the loop.
   - `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`.
   - `l` is `n - 2 * d`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `d`**: Since the loop increments `d` by 1 each time, if the loop did not execute in the previous iteration, it means `d` was already at its upper limit, which is `n // 2 + 1`.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `d` needs to be incremented from `n // 2 + 1` to `n // 2 + 2`.
   - However, since `d` cannot exceed `n // 2 + 1`, the loop cannot execute again.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop does not execute, the states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which doesn't occur) remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final State:**
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` is the maximum value found during the loop, `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`, and `l` is `n - 2 * d`.**
