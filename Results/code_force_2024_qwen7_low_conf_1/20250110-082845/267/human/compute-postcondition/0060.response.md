`count` is updated by adding the value returned by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. Since `l` is `k + 1` and `k` was the value of `l` at the end of the previous iteration, we know `l` is `k + 1`. However, the exact value of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` is not specified, so we will denote it as `val`.

Therefore, the new value of `count` is `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + val`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined, `max_length` is `2 * d`, and `l` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `l` at the end of the previous iteration.**
