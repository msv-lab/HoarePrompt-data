Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` is `2 * d`, `l` remains `1`, and `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[0], s[d - 1])` and adding `func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])` to its current value.***

Explanation: Since the `else` part is not provided, we consider the `if` part as the only case. The postcondition of the `if` part directly gives us the overall postcondition of the entire if-else block because there are no other cases to consider.
