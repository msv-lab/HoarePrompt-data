The code `max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)` updates the value of `max_length` to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`. 

- `max_length` is initially at least `2 * d`, so the new value of `max_length` will be `2 * d` if the current value of `max_length` is less than `2 * d`.
- All other variables (`s`, `n`, `d`, `l`, `count`) remain unchanged.

Since the exact value of `d` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `max_length`. However, we know that `max_length` is now `2 * d`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` is `2 * d`, `l` remains `1`, and `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[0], s[d - 1])` and adding `func_2(s[d], s[2 * d - 1])` to its current value.**
