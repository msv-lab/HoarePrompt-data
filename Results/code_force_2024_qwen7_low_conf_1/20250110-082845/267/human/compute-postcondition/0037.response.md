First, let's break down the initial state and the given code:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`.
- `max_length` is `2 * d` if `count == d`, where `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`.
- `l` is `0`.
- `count` is reduced by `func_2(s[-1], s[d - 1])`.

The code being executed is:
```python
count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables Affected by the Code:**
   - `count` is the only variable directly affected by the code.

2. **Determine Values of Affected Variables:**
   - `l` is `0`, so `s[l + d - 1]` simplifies to `s[d - 1]`.
   - `s[l + 2 * d - 1]` simplifies to `s[2 * d - 1]`.

3. **Calculate the New Value of `count`:**
   - The new value of `count` is `count + func_2(s[d - 1], s[2 * d - 1])`.
   - The exact value of `count` depends on its initial value and the result of `func_2(s[d - 1], s[2 * d - 1])`.

4. **Check Precondition and Validity:**
   - Ensure `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`. This ensures the indices `d - 1` and `2 * d - 1` are within bounds of the string `s`.

Given the complexity and lack of specific `func_2` definition, the exact new value of `count` cannot be determined without knowing the function's behavior. However, we know it is updated by the result of `func_2(s[d - 1], s[2 * d - 1])`.

### Output State:
The output state includes the updated value of `count` and retains the unchanged values of other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` is `2 * d` if `count == d`, where `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`, `l` is `0`, `count` is updated by `count + func_2(s[d - 1], s[2 * d - 1])**.
