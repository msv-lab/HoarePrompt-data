Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` is `2 * d` if `count == d`, where `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`, and `l` is `0`. If `l` is greater than `0`, `count` is updated by `count + func_2(s[d - 1], s[2 * d - 1])`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
