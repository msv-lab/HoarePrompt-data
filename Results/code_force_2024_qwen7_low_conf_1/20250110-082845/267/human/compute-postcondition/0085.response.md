Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks with a maximum length of 5000. It iterates through possible substring lengths from half the length of `s` down to 1, checking for substrings where each character matches the corresponding character in the mirrored position, allowing for '?' to match any character. If such a matching substring of length `sub_len` is found, it updates `max_len` to be the maximum value between `max_len` and `sub_len`. After examining all possible lengths, the function returns `max_len`, which represents the longest valid substring meeting the specified condition. Potential edge cases include strings with no valid matching substrings, where `max_len` would be 0. Additionally, if `s` is an empty string or contains only '?', the function will correctly handle these scenarios by returning 0.**
