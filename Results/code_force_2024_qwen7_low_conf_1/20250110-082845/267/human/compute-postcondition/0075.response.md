`match_count` is incremented by 1. The value of `sub_len` is decreased by 1, and `i` is set to `len(s) - sub_len - 1`. Since `i` is calculated based on `len(s)` and `sub_len`, and `len(s)` remains unchanged, the value of `i` will also change accordingly. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`s` remains unchanged, `max_len` remains unchanged, `match_count` is increased by 1, `sub_len` is decreased by 1, `i` is `len(s) - sub_len - 1`, `len(s)` remains unchanged, and `len(s) - sub_len - 1` must be greater than 0 or greater than or equal to 0.**
