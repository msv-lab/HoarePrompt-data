Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `max_len` is the maximum length of matching substrings found during the loop execution, `match_count` is 0, `sub_len` is 0, `i` is `len(s) - sub_len - 1` (which is `len(s) - 1`), and `len(s)` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- After the loop completes, `sub_len` will be 0 because it is continuously decremented until it reaches 0.
- `match_count` will be 0 if no matches were found, or it will be the count of consecutive matches if any were found.
- The loop terminates when `sub_len` reaches 0, meaning the loop body will not execute further.
- `i` will be `len(s) - sub_len - 1`, which simplifies to `len(s) - 1`.
- `max_len` will hold the maximum length of matching substrings found during the loop execution, or it will remain unchanged if no matches were found.
- The strings `s`, `max_len`, and `len(s)` themselves do not change during the loop.

This output state captures the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.
