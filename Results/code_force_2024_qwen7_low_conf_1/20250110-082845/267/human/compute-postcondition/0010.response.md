The code updates `max_length` to be the maximum value between `max_length` and `2 * d`. Given the initial state, `max_length` is initially 0, and `2 * d` is a specific value based on the precondition.

Since `max_length` is initially 0, and `2 * d` is a positive value (as `d` must be at least 1), `max_length` will be updated to `2 * d`.

The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `count`, `l`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2 * d + 1, `max_length` is 2 * d, `count` is incremented by 1 if `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` is True and `l` is greater than 0, and `count` is equal to `d`**
