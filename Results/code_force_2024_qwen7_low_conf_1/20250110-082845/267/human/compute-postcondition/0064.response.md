Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `count` is the result of the specified summation operation.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`.
- `d` is defined.
- `max_length` is `2 * d`.
- `l` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `l` at the end of the previous iteration.
- If `l > 0`, `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.
- The value of `max_length` remains `2 * d`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for l in range(n - 2 * d):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `l = 0` to `l = n - 2 * d - 1`. Therefore, at the end of each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1.
2. **Update of `l`**: Since `l` starts at `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `l` at the end of the previous iteration), after one iteration, `l` becomes `k + 2` if `k + 1 <= n - 2 * d - 1`.
3. **Condition for Update**: If `l > 0`, then `count` is updated based on the function calls involving `s` elements.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `l` was `k + 1`. After the update, `l` becomes `k + 2` (if `k + 2 <= n - 2 * d - 1`).
2. **Check for Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `l` must be within the range `0` to `n - 2 * d - 1`.
3. **Update `count`**: If `l > 0`, `count` will be updated as described in the loop body.

### Final States:
- `count` will be updated if `l > 0`.
- `l` will be `k + 2` if `k + 2 <= n - 2 * d - 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `d` remains the same.
- `max_length` remains `2 * d`.

### Adjusted States:
- `l` is now `k + 2` (or `l + 1` from the previous iteration).
- `count` is updated if `l > 0`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`count` is the result of the specified summation operation, `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined, `max_length` is `2 * d`, `l` is `k + 2` (or `l + 1` from the previous iteration), and `count` is updated if `l > 0`.**

State: **`count` is the result of the specified summation operation, `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined, `max_length` is `2 * d`, `l` is `k + 2`, and `count` is updated if `l > 0`.**
