Postcondition: ***`count` is the result of the specified summation operation, `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined, `max_length` is `2 * d`, `l` is `k + 2`. If `l > 0` and `count == d`, `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
