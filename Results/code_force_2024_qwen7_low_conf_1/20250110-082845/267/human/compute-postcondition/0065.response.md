The code `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` impacts the variable `count` by subtracting the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from `count`. 

Given the initial state:
- `count` is the result of a specified summation operation.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`.
- `d` is defined.
- `max_length` is `2 * d`.
- `l` is `k + 2`.
- `count` is updated if `l > 0`.

From the initial state, we know `l > 0` because `l` is defined as `k + 2` and there's no indication that `k` is non-positive, thus `l` would be positive. This means the subtraction operation will indeed take place.

Since the specific values of `s`, `func_2`, `d`, and `k` are not provided, we will express the changes in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`count` is `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined, `max_length` is `2 * d`, `l` is `k + 2`**
