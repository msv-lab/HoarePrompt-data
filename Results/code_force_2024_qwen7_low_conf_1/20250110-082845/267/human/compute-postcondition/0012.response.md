Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` must be at least 2 * `d` + 1.
- `max_length` is 2 * `d`.
- `count` is incremented by 1 if `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` is True and `l` is greater than 0.
- `count` is equal to `d`.

### Loop:
```python
for l in range(n - 2 * d):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `l = 0` to `l = n - 2 * d - 1`.
2. **Incrementing `l`**: At each iteration, `l` increases by 1.
3. **Condition for Execution**: The loop continues as long as `l` is less than `n - 2 * d`.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `l` is currently at its maximum value, which is `n - 2 * d - 1`.
- Since `l` is at its maximum value, the loop will not execute in the next iteration because `l + 1` would be out of bounds (greater than or equal to `n - 2 * d`).

### Adjusted States for Next Iteration:
- Since `l` is already at its maximum value (`n - 2 * d - 1`), no changes are needed for `l`.
- The value of `n` does not change within the loop.
- `max_length` remains the same.
- `count` remains the same unless the loop body changes it, but since the loop is not executing, `count` stays at `d`.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop cannot execute again due to the condition `l < n - 2 * d` being false when `l` is at `n - 2 * d - 1`, no adjustments are needed for the states other than noting that the loop will not run again.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2 * `d` + 1, `max_length` is 2 * `d`, `count` is equal to `d`, `l` is `n - 2 * d - 1`**
