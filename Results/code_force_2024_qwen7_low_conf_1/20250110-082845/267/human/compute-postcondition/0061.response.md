Postcondition: ***`count` is the result of the specified summation operation, `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined, and `max_length` is `2 * d`. `l` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `l` at the end of the previous iteration. If `l > 0`, `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above for the if part.***
