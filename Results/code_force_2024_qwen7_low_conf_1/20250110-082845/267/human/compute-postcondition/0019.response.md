The code updates the `count` variable by subtracting the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from it. Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is at least `2 * d + 1`
- `max_length` is `2 * d`
- `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`
- `l` is `n - 2 * d - 2`

After executing the line `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, the new value of `count` will be the previous value of `count` minus `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least `2 * d + 1`, `max_length` is `2 * d`, `count` is the previous value of `count` minus `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, `l` is `n - 2 * d - 2`**
