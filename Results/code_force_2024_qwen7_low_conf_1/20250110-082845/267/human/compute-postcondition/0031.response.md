Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` remains `0`, `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`, `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` and then adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` if `l > 0`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
