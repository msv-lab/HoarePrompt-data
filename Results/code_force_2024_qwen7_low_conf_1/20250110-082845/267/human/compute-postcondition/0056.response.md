The code snippet updates the `max_length` variable to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `max_length`, it is assumed to be an undefined variable initially. The value of `count` is also given as `d`, and the other conditions are met. After executing the line of code, `max_length` will be set to `2 * d` because `max_length` is not specified and `2 * d` is greater than any unspecified value.

Output State: **`count` is `d`, `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined, `max_length` is `2 * d`**
