The code snippet sets `max_length` to the maximum value between its current value and `2 * d`. This does not affect the value of `s`, `n`, `d`, or `count`. Therefore, the only change is to `max_length`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least `2 * d + 1`, `max_length` is `max(2 * d, max_length)`, `count` is updated according to the rules provided, and `l` is `n - 2 * d - 2`.**
