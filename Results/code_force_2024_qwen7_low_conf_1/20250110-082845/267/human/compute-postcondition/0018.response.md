According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`. The loop runs from `0` to `n - 2 * d - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is at least `2 * d + 1`.
- `max_length` is `2 * d`.
- `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.
- `l` is `n - 2 * d - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1, making it `n - 2 * d - 2`. There is no specific change required for other variables unless `count` equals `d`, but since no specific change is mentioned if `count == d`, we assume `count` does not equal `d` for this iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least `2 * d + 1`, `max_length` is `2 * d`, `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, `l` is `n - 2 * d - 2`**
