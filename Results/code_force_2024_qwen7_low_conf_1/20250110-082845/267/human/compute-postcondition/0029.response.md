The code subtracts the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from `count`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the given code snippet. Without knowing the implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `count`. Therefore, we can only say that `count` has been updated by subtracting the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` is `0`, `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`, `l` is greater than `0`, `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`**
