Let's break down the given program state and the for loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Program State:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`.
- `max_length` is `0`.
- `count` is the sum of 1 for each pair of characters in the string `s` that are separated by a distance `d`.

### For Loop:
```python
for l in range(n - 2 * d):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `l`:**
   - The loop runs from `l = 0` to `l < n - 2 * d`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n - 2 * d` must be at least 1 (i.e., `n - 2 * d > 0`).

2. **Variable `d`:**
   - Since `d` is used in the range calculation (`n - 2 * d`), it should be defined and non-negative.
   - `d` should be an integer such that `2 * d <= n`.

3. **Variable `n`:**
   - The problem statement already provides a constraint on `n`: `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`.
   - This condition ensures `n` is valid for the loop to run.

4. **Variables `max_length` and `count`:**
   - These variables do not directly affect the loop's execution but their values might change within the loop.
   - Since we are only concerned with the initial state before the loop, these values can remain as provided.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, the key adjustments needed are:
- Ensure `n - 2 * d > 0`.
- Ensure `d` is a non-negative integer.
- Ensure `n` satisfies the given constraint: `n >= 2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`.

Therefore, the required state before the loop starts is:

**State:**
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`.
- `max_length` is `0`.
- `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n`.
- `n - 2 * d > 0`.

In summary:
**State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` is `0`, `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`**.
