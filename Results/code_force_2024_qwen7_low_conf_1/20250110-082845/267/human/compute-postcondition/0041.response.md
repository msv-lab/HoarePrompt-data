Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`.
   - `max_length` is the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`.
   - `l` is `0`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `l` from `0` to `n - 2 * d - 1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `l` is greater than `0`, `count` is updated by `count + func_2(s[d - 1], s[2 * d - 1])`.
   - Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`.
   - `max_length` is the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`.
   - `l` is `0`.

5. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented from `0` to `1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `l` will be `1`.

6. **State Update:**
   - Since `l` is now `1`, the condition `if l > 0` will be true.
   - `count` will be updated by `count + func_2(s[d - 1], s[2 * d - 1])`.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `l` is now `1`.
- `count` is updated by adding `func_2(s[d - 1], s[2 * d - 1])` to its current value.

The final state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` is the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`, `l` is `1`, and `count` is updated by adding `func_2(s[d - 1], s[2 * d - 1])` to its current value.**
