The code snippet updates the `max_length` variable to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`. Given the initial state:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks,
- `n` is at least `2 * d + 1`,
- `max_length` is `2 * d`,
- `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`,
- `l` is `n - 2 * d - 1`.

Since `max_length` is initially set to `2 * d`, and the code sets `max_length` to be the maximum of its current value (`2 * d`) and `2 * d`, `max_length` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least `2 * d + 1`, `max_length` is `2 * d`, `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, `l` is `n - 2 * d - 1`.**
