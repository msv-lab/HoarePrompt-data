The code subtracts 1 from `count` and assigns the result back to `count`. The function `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` is called with arguments `s[l - 1]` and `s[l - 1 + d]`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, we will denote its result as `result`.

Therefore, `count` is updated to `count - result`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2 * d + 1, `max_length` is 0, `count` is the number of times `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` is True for `i` in the range from `0` to `len(s) - d` minus `result`, `l` is greater than 0**
