The code snippet uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count the number of times the condition `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` evaluates to `True` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `len(s) - d`. However, since the exact definition of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific outcome of the condition. Therefore, we can only state that `count` is assigned the value of this sum, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2, `max_length` is 0, `count` is the number of times `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` is True for `i` in the range from `0` to `len(s) - d`.**
