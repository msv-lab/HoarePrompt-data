Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Range**: The loop variable is `l`, and the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2 * d - 1`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `n - 2 * d` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2 * d - 1`. This means that `n - 2 * d` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Initial State of count**: The value of `count` is determined by the expression `sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d]))`. This expression evaluates to the number of times `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns `True` for each `i` in the range `0` to `d-1`.

4. **Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop involves the variables `l`, `n`, `d`, and implicitly `s` (the list being indexed).

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state such that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n - 2 * d >= 1`.

State: **`count` is the result of `sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d]))`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined, and `s` is a list**.

However, since we are focusing on ensuring the loop can execute, the key adjustments needed are related to `n` and `d`:

State: **`count` is the result of `sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d]))`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined**.
