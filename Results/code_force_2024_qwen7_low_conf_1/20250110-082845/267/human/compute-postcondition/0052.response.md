`count` is initially the result of `sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d]))`. This means `count` is a count of how many times `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns a true value for `i` in the range from `0` to `d-1`. The code `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` subtracts the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from `count`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` is called, its value is subtracted from `count`, but we don't know the exact value of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` without knowing the specifics of `func_2`, `s`, and `l`. However, we can express `count` as the original `count` minus the result of this function call.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`count` is `sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d])) - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined, and the length of the list `l` is greater than 0.**
