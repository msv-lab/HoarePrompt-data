The code updates the `count` variable by adding the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. The `count` variable was previously updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`. Since the exact value of `func_2` is not known, we can only express `count` in terms of its previous value.

The initial conditions remain unchanged, except for the `count` variable which is now updated to include the new value added by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` is `0`, `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`, `l` is greater than `0`, `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` and then adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`**
