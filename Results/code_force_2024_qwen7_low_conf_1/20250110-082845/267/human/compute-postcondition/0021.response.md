Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is at least `2 * d + 1`, `max_length` is `2 * d`, `count` is updated according to the following rules: if `l > 0`, `count` is the previous value of `count` minus `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` plus `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged, and `l` is `n - 2 * d - 2`.***
