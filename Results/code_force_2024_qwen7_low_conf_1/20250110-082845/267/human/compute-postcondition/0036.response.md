The code `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` impacts the variable `count` by subtracting the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from `count`. Let's break down the variables:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`.
- `max_length` is `2 * d` if `count == d`, where `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`.
- `l` is `0`.

Since `l` is `0`, `s[l - 1]` refers to `s[-1]`, which is invalid because strings in Python are 0-indexed and do not support negative indexing without slicing. However, considering the context and the problem, let's assume `s` has at least one character, making `s[-1]` valid and referring to the last character of the string `s`. Similarly, `s[l - 1 + d]` would refer to `s[d - 1]`, which is valid only if `d > 0`.

Given these assumptions, the function `func_2(s[-1], s[d - 1])` will be called, and its result will be subtracted from `count`.

Since the exact value of `func_2(s[-1], s[d - 1])` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `count`. However, we know that `count` is reduced by this value.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`.
- `max_length` is `2 * d` if `count == d`, where `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`.
- `l` is `0`.
- `count` is reduced by `func_2(s[-1], s[d - 1])`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least `2 * (n // 2 + 1) + 1`, `max_length` is `2 * d` if `count == d`, where `d` is a non-negative integer such that `2 * d <= n` and `n - 2 * d > 0`, `l` is `0`, and `count` is reduced by `func_2(s[-1], s[d - 1])`.**
