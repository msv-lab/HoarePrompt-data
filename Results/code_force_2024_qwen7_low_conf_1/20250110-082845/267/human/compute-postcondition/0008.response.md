Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2 * d + 1, `max_length` is 0, `count` is incremented by 1 if `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` is True and `l` is greater than 0. Since there is no else part, the conditions specified in the if part remain the final state of the program variables.***
