Postcondition: **`count` is the result of `sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d]))` and has been updated as `sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d])) - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` if the length of the list `l` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`. `d` is defined. The current value of `count` is equal to `d`.**
