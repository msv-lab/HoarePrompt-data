Postcondition: **`count` is the result of `sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d]))`. `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * d + 1`, `d` is defined. If the length of the list `l` is greater than 0, then `count` is updated as `sum(1 for i in range(d) if func_2(s[i], s[i + d])) - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
