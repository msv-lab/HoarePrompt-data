Postcondition: **`s` remains unchanged, `max_len` is equal to the maximum of `max_len` and `sub_len`, `match_count` is either increased by 1 or set to 0, `sub_len` is decreased by 1, `i` is `len(s) - sub_len - 1`, `len(s)` remains unchanged, and `len(s) - sub_len - 1` must be greater than 0 or greater than or equal to 0.**
