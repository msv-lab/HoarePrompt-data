Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop runs for `l` in the range from `0` to `n - 2 * d`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n - 2 * d` must be at least 1 (since `l` starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 2 * d - 1`).

2. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `max_length` is 0.
   - `count` is the number of times `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` is True for `i` in the range from `0` to `len(s) - d`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop runs based on the condition `0 <= l < n - 2 * d`, we need to ensure that `n - 2 * d >= 1`.
   - This means that `n` must be at least `2 * d + 1`.

4. **State Before Loop Execution:**
   - We need to adjust the initial value of `n` to ensure that the loop can run. Given that `n` must be at least 2, we need to ensure `n` is sufficiently large to satisfy the loop condition.
   - Specifically, `n` should be at least `2 * d + 1`.

5. **Additional Considerations:**
   - `d` is not explicitly given its value, but we know it must be a non-negative integer since `n` must be at least `2 * d + 1`.
   - The states for `s`, `max_length`, and `count` do not affect the loop's ability to execute directly.

**Conclusion:**

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2 * d + 1, `max_length` is 0, `count` is the number of times `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` is True for `i` in the range from `0` to `len(s) - d`**.
