#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer representing the total number of months, x is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, and costs is a list of positive integers where costs[i] represents the cost to obtain one unit of happiness in the i-th month.
def func_1(m, x, costs):
    costs.sort(reverse=True)
    earnings = 0
    happiness = []
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        earnings += x
        
        while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings:
            earnings -= costs[-1]
            happiness.append(1)
            costs.pop()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` is an empty list, `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x` multiplied by `m`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `m` times, `i` is `m + 1`.
    return len(happiness)
    #The program returns m
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m`, `x`, and `costs`. 
- `m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months.
- `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary.
- `costs` is a list of positive integers where `costs[i]` represents the cost to obtain one unit of happiness in the i-th month.

The function sorts the `costs` list in descending order. It then iterates over the months from 1 to `m`, accumulating the total earnings by adding `x` (monthly salary) for each month. Within each iteration, it checks if the last element in the `costs` list is less than or equal to the current accumulated earnings. If true, it subtracts the cost from the earnings and appends 1 to the `happiness` list, indicating one unit of happiness was obtained, and removes the cost from the `costs` list. This process continues until either no more costs can be subtracted from the earnings or the loop completes.

After the loop, the function returns the length of the `happiness` list, which is guaranteed to be `m` because the loop runs exactly `m` times and appends 1 to the `happiness` list each time. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program returns `m`, indicating the total number of units of happiness that could be obtained given the constraints.
