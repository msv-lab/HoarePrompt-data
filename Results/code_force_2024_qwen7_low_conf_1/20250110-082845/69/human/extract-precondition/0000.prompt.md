You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: You can never buy enough happiness, so here we go again! In this version, you
can only buy h_i = 1 unit of happiness each month, but the number of months is
hugely increased. We are in the realm of quantum happiness and time dilation.

Being a physicist, Charlie likes to plan his life in simple and precise terms.

For the next m months, starting with no money, Charlie will work hard and earn
x pounds per month. For the i -th month (1 \le i \le m) , there'll be a single
opportunity of paying cost c_i pounds to obtain one unit of happiness. You
cannot buy more than one unit each month.

Borrowing is not allowed. Money earned in the i -th month can only be spent in
a later j -th month (j>i ).

Since physicists don't code, help Charlie find the maximum reachable units of
happiness.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers, m and x (1 \le m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x \le 10^3 ) — the total number of months and the monthly
salary.

The second line of each test case contains m integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m (1
\leq c_i \leq 10^3 ) — the cost of one unit of happiness for each month.

It is guaranteed that sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the maximal amount of happiness
Charlie can get.
