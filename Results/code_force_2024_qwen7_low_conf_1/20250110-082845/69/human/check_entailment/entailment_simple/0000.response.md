Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the money earned in the current month can only be spent in future months. Instead, it spends the earned money immediately and adjusts the `earnings` variable, which leads to incorrect results.

### Issues:
1. **Immediate Spending**: The program immediately spends the earned money (`x`) each month and does not accumulate it until a future month. This violates the requirement that money earned in the i-th month can only be spent in a later j-th month (j > i).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Spending**: The `while` loop inside the `for` loop checks if the last element in `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`. However, this logic should be adjusted to ensure that the money is spent only when there is a future opportunity to spend it. 

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the problem, you need to use a different approach. One way to achieve this is by maintaining a stack to keep track of future opportunities to spend the money. Here's a revised implementation:

```python
import sys

def func_1(m, x, costs):
    stack = []
    for i in range(m):
        stack.append(x)
    
    happiness = 0
    for cost in costs:
        while stack and cost <= stack[-1]:
            stack.pop()
            happiness += 1
        if stack:
            stack[-1] -= cost
    
    return happiness

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (m, x) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(m, x, costs))
```

### Explanation of the Correct Implementation:
1. **Stack Initialization**: Initialize a stack with `x` for each of the `m` months.
2. **Iterate Through Costs**: For each cost, try to use money from the stack to buy happiness.
3. **Pop and Buy Happiness**: If the cost is less than or equal to the top of the stack, pop the stack and increment the happiness count.
4. **Adjust Stack**: If the cost is greater than the top of the stack, adjust the top of the stack by subtracting the cost.

This ensures that money earned in the current month is used only in future months as required by the problem statement.
