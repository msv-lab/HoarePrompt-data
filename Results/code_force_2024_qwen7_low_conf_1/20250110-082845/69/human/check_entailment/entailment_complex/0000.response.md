Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum units of happiness Charlie can achieve given his monthly earnings and the costs to buy happiness units each month.
2. The provided solution involves sorting the costs in descending order and iterating through each month to accumulate earnings and purchase happiness units when possible.
3. The key logic inside the function `func_1` correctly implements the strategy of buying happiness units whenever the cost is within the accumulated earnings.
4. The function ensures that it only buys one happiness unit per month and stops when the cost exceeds the available earnings.
5. After the loop, the function returns the length of the `happiness` list, which indeed represents the total number of happiness units bought.
6. The example test cases provided validate the correctness of the logic.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the required logic to maximize the happiness units Charlie can obtain.

Correctness: **True**
