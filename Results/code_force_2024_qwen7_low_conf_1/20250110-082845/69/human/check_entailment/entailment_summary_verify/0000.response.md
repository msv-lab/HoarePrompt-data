### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to evaluate the correctness of the function `func_1`.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of happiness units Charlie can acquire within `m` months, given his monthly salary `x` and the cost `c_i` to buy one unit of happiness in the i-th month.
- **Constraints**: 
  - Monthly salary `x` and cost `c_i` are positive integers.
  - No borrowing is allowed, meaning Charlie can only spend future earnings to buy happiness.
  - Charlie starts with no money.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it takes the total number of months `m`, the monthly salary `x`, and the list of costs `costs`.
- The function `func_1` sorts the `costs` list in descending order.
- It iterates over each month, accumulating the earnings by adding `x` for each month.
- For each month, it checks if the current cost can be paid with the accumulated earnings. If yes, it subtracts the cost from the earnings and appends 1 to the `happiness` list.
- Finally, it returns the length of the `happiness` list, which represents the total number of happiness units acquired.

#### Function Summary Validation:
- The function correctly sorts the costs in descending order.
- It iterates over each month, ensuring that the cost is only deducted from the earnings if it is less than or equal to the current earnings.
- It ensures that the cost is only paid if it is feasible with the accumulated earnings.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the example test case:
```
2
3 3
4 2 2
```
- **First Test Case**:
  - `m = 3`, `x = 3`, `costs = [4, 2, 2]`
  - Earnings: 3 (initially), then 6, then 9.
  - Cost analysis:
    - Month 1: Cost 4 > Earnings 3, so no happiness.
    - Month 2: Cost 2 <= Earnings 6, so 6 - 2 = 4, happiness = 1.
    - Month 3: Cost 2 <= Earnings 4, so 4 - 2 = 2, happiness = 2.
  - Output: 2 (correct).

- **Second Test Case**:
  - `m = 3`, `x = 3`, `costs = [4, 2, 2]`
  - Similar logic applies as above, resulting in 2 units of happiness.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of happiness units by only spending future earnings when feasible. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the program does not have the issue mentioned in the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and follows the required logic to maximize the happiness units.
