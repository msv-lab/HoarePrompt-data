You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You can never buy enough happiness, so here we go again! In this version, you
can only buy h_i = 1 unit of happiness each month, but the number of months is
hugely increased. We are in the realm of quantum happiness and time dilation.

Being a physicist, Charlie likes to plan his life in simple and precise terms.

For the next m months, starting with no money, Charlie will work hard and earn
x pounds per month. For the i -th month (1 \le i \le m) , there'll be a single
opportunity of paying cost c_i pounds to obtain one unit of happiness. You
cannot buy more than one unit each month.

Borrowing is not allowed. Money earned in the i -th month can only be spent in
a later j -th month (j>i ).

Since physicists don't code, help Charlie find the maximum reachable units of
happiness.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers, m and x (1 \le m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x \le 10^3 ) — the total number of months and the monthly
salary.

The second line of each test case contains m integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m (1
\leq c_i \leq 10^3 ) — the cost of one unit of happiness for each month.

It is guaranteed that sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the maximal amount of happiness
Charlie can get.

Example

Input

    4 1
    
    4 1 3 1

    1 3 4 3

Program:
```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (m, x) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(m, x, costs))

def func_1(m, x, costs):
    costs.sort(reverse=True)
    earnings = 0
    happiness = []
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        earnings += x
        while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings:
            earnings -= costs[-1]
            happiness.append(1)
            costs.pop()
    return len(happiness)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
