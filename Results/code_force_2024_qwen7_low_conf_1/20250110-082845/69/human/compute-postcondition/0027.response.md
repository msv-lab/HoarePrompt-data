`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. This affects the value of `costs`, which now has one less element than before. The `earnings` variable is defined as `E - costs[-1]`, and since the last element is removed, the `earnings` will no longer reference the last element of `costs`. The `happiness` list gains an additional element `1`.

Output State: **`earnings` is `E`, `costs` is the same as before except the last element is removed, `happiness` is a list with an additional element `1`, and the other variables remain unchanged.**
