Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `rs` contains the value `cnt`.
   - `s` is `m * n + sum_of_adjustments`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive elements from `l` that could be deducted from `s` without making `s` negative.
   - `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cnt` at any point during the loop.
   - `h` contains the smallest possible values that were pushed during the loop.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. This means the loop will execute based on the number of inputs provided.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The variable `i` is set to `n` at the start of each iteration.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `cnt` is updated within the loop based on the maximum count of consecutive elements that can be deducted from `s` without making `s` negative.
   - The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum `cnt` value encountered during the loop.
   - The variable `h` contains the smallest possible values pushed during the loop, but its exact value will depend on the loop body, which is omitted.

Since the loop runs for a specified number of iterations (`int(input())`), the only thing that changes at the start of each iteration is the initial value of `i` being set to `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the states to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to `n`.

The other variables (`rs`, `s`, `cnt`, `mx`, and `h`) remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`rs` contains the value `cnt`, `s` is `m * n + sum_of_adjustments`, `i` is `n`, `n` remains the same, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive elements from `l` that could be deducted from `s` without making `s` negative, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cnt` at any point during the loop, and `h` contains the smallest possible values that were pushed during the loop.**
