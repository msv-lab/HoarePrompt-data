The code `mx = max(mx, cnt)` updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. Given the initial state, `mx` is initially 1 and `cnt` is 2. Therefore, `max(mx, cnt)` will be 2.

The updated values are:
- `mx` is now 2
- All other variables (`rs`, `s`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `cnt`, and `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is `s - l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 2, `mx` is 2, `h` is a heap containing `-l[i]`**
