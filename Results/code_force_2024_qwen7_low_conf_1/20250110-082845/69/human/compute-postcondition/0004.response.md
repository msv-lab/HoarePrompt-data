`earnings` is assigned the value of `earnings` plus `x`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, so the value of `earnings` is now increased by `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is 0 + `x`, `happiness` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `m + 1` must be greater than 1**
