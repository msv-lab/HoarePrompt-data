State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is 0, `happiness` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `m + 1` must be greater than 1**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, m + 1):` means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `m`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 1.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i <= m` must be true.
   - This translates to `m + 1 > 1`, because the loop will start at `i = 1` and continue until `i <= m`.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `m` is a positive integer, which ensures there are valid months to iterate over.
   - `x` is a positive integer, representing the monthly salary, which doesn't directly affect the loop's execution but might be used within the loop body.
   - `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, which will be iterated over during the loop.
   - `earnings` is initialized to 0 and `happiness` is an empty list; these will be modified within the loop but don't affect the initial state required for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the required states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` is 1
- `m + 1` must be greater than 1 (which simplifies to `m` being a positive integer greater than 0)
