`s` is decremented by `l[i]`. The value of `l[i]` is not specified in the initial state, but since `i` is 1 and assuming `l` is a list that has at least one element, `l[i]` (which is `l[1]`) will be used. However, without knowing the exact value of `l[1]`, we can represent the change in `s` as `s - l[1]`. The states of the other variables (`total`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s` is now `s - l[1]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s` is `s - l[1]`**.
