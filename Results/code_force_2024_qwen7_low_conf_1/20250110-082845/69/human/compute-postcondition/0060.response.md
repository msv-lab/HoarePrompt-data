The code `heapq.heappush(h, -l[i])` pushes `-l[i]` onto the heap `h`. Given that `i` is 1, the value `-l[1]` is pushed onto the heap. The initial value of `s` is `s - l[1]`, which remains unchanged because `s` itself is not being modified in this operation.

The state of `total` and `i` also remains unchanged since they are not affected by the operation. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `total` is still 0
- `i` is still 1
- `n` must still be greater than 0
- `s` is still `s - l[1]`
- A value `-l[1]` is pushed onto the heap `h`

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s - l[1]`, and `-l[1]` is pushed onto the heap `h`**
