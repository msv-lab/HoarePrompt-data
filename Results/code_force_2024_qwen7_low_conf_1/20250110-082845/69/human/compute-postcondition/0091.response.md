The `heapq.heappop(h)` function pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since the exact initial values of `h` are not provided, let's assume `h` contains elements such that the smallest element can be popped. The other variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is `i+1` (which means `i` is incremented by 1)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s` is updated by adding `abs(h[0]) - l[i]` to its current value
- `cnt` retains its value
- `mx` retains its value
- `h` retains its state unless the condition `l[i] < abs(h[0])` is true

After `heapq.heappop(h)` executes, `h` loses its smallest element, but since the specific values in `h` are not given, we can only say that the smallest element is removed. The other variables remain as they are unless the condition `l[i] < abs(h[0])` is met, which isn't directly impacted by the pop operation itself.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated by adding `abs(h[0]) - l[i]` to its current value, `cnt` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, and `h` has lost its smallest element.**
