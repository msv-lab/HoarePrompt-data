`cnt` is assigned the value `0`. The initial value of `cnt` was `rs`, which contained the value of `cnt`. Therefore, `rs` is now also `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `mx` is 0, and `h` contains the smallest possible values that were pushed during the loop; `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.**
