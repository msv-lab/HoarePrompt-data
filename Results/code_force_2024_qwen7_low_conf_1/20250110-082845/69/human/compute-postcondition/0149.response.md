The code snippet `print(*rs, sep='\n')` prints each element of the list `rs` on a new line. However, this operation does not modify any of the variables listed in the initial state.

Output State: **`rs` is a list of all `cnt` values from each iteration, `s` is the sum of `m * n` minus the sum of elements in `l` that could not be subtracted from `s`, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of the list `l` for the last input, `m` is the input integer for the last iteration, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive elements from `l` that could be deducted from `s` without making `s` negative during the last iteration, `mx` is the maximum value between its original value and `cnt + 1` encountered during the loop, and `h` is a heap containing the smallest possible values that were pushed during the loop.**
