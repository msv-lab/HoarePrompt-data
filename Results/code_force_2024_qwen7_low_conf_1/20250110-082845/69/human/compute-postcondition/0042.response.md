`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since the last element of `costs` was less than or equal to `earnings`, removing this element does not affect the relationship between `earnings` and the last element of `costs`. The `happiness` list and the value of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`costs` is a non-empty list with its last element less than or equal to `earnings`; `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x` minus the new last element of `costs`; `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+2` times; `i` is `i_end + 2`.**
