The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. The initial state is that `earnings` is `E - costs[-1]`, and `costs` has at least one element, with the second-to-last element of the original `costs` being less than or equal to `E`. After executing the code, the value of `earnings` remains unchanged, but `happiness` now includes the value `1`.

Output State: **`earnings` is `E - costs[-1]`, `costs` has at least one element, and the second-to-last element of the original `costs` is less than or equal to `E`; `happiness` contains at least the value `1`.**
