Postcondition: ***`rs` is 0, `s` is either `abs(h[0]) - l[i]` if `l[i]` < `abs(h[0])`, or remains unchanged otherwise, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `mx` is 0, `h` contains `-l[i]` if `l[i]` < `abs(h[0])`, otherwise `h` remains as an empty list, and `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.***
