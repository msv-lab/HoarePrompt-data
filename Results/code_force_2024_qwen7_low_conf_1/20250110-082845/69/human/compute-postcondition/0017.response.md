Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order (excluding all elements), `earnings` is `x - n * costs[-1]` where `n` is the number of times the loop has executed, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times, `i` is the value it was set to at the start of the last iteration of the loop, `m + 1` must be greater than 1**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `costs` is not empty and the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`.
- Each iteration of the loop subtracts the last element of `costs` from `earnings`, appends `1` to `happiness`, and removes the last element of `costs`.
- Once `costs` becomes empty or the condition `costs[-1] <= earnings` is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates.
- The final value of `earnings` will be `x` minus the sum of the last `n` elements of `costs`, where `n` is the number of times the loop executed.
- The `happiness` list will contain `1` repeated `n` times, where `n` is the number of times the loop executed.
- The value of `i` will be the value it was set to at the start of the last iteration of the loop, which is `2` if the loop executed more than once, and `1` if the loop did not execute more than once.
- The value of `m + 1` must be greater than 1, as stated in the initial state.
