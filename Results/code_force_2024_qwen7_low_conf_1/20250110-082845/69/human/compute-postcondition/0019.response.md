`earnings` is incremented by `x`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, so `earnings` becomes its original value plus `x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is `x + (x - n * costs[-1])`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `m + 1` must be greater than 1**
