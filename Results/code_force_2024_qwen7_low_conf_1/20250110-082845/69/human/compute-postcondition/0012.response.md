The code `costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. The previous state of `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order without its last element. After executing `costs.pop()`, the last element of `costs` is removed, but the list remains sorted in descending order.

The other variables (`x`, `earnings`, `happiness`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order excluding its last element, `earnings` is `x - 2 * costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1, 1]`, `i` is 2**
