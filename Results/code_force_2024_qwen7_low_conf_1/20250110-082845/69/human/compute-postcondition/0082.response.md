Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated to either `s + abs(h[0]) - l[i]` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` or `s + abs(h[0])` if the condition is false, `cnt` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, and `h` is a heap with either the additional element `-l[i]` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` or retains its original state.***
