Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated to `s + 1 - l[0]`, and `h` is a heap containing `-l[0]`, provided that `l[i] < abs(h[0])`. If the condition `l[i] < abs(h[0])` is false, the same variables retain their initial states: `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `s` remains as it was, with `h` being a heap containing `-l[0]` if it was initialized in the if part.***
