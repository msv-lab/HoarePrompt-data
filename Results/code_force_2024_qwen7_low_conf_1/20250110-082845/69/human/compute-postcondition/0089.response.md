The code updates `mx` to be the maximum value between `mx` and `cnt`. Since `cnt` was increased by 1 in the initial state, `cnt` is now equal to the initial value of `i+1` plus 1, which simplifies to `i+2`. The initial value of `mx` is not specified, but it will be updated to the maximum of its original value and `cnt` (which is `i+2`).

Therefore, `mx` will be `max(mx, i+2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated by subtracting `l[i]`, `cnt` is `i+2`, `mx` is `max(mx, i+2)`, and `-l[i]` is pushed onto the heap `h`.**
