Postcondition: ***`rs` is 0, `s` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `mx` is 0, `h` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `s` is less than `l[i]`. The condition `(h)` is true, and the current value of `l[i]` is less than the absolute value of the first element of `h`.***
