`happiness` is appended with the value `1`. The last element of `happiness` was `1`, and since `happiness` contains `1` repeated `n+2` times, it now contains `1` repeated `n+3` times. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The value of `earnings` is updated to `earnings - costs[-1]`, but the last element of `costs` (which is less than or equal to `earnings`) is subtracted from `earnings`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`costs` is a non-empty list with its last element less than or equal to `earnings`; `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+3` times; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`**
