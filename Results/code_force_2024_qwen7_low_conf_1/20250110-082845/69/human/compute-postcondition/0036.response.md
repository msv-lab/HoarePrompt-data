`earnings` is decreased by the last element in the `costs` list, which is `0`. The value of `i` is `i_end + 2`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `earnings` remains the same as its initial state plus `x`.

Output State: **`costs` is [0], `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `earnings` is unchanged**
