The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` subtracts the last element of the `costs` list from `earnings`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `earnings` and `costs`, we will represent them in terms of their initial values.

Let's assume:
- `earnings` is initially `E`.
- `costs` is a list, and its last element is `C[-1]`.

The code modifies `earnings` by subtracting `costs[-1]` from it. So, the new value of `earnings` will be `E - C[-1]`.

Output State: **`earnings` is `E - C[-1]`, `costs` is the same as before**
