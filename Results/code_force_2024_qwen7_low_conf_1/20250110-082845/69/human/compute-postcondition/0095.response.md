Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `i+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated by either subtracting `l[i]` or adding `abs(l[i]) - h[0]` to its current value if `l[i] < abs(h[0])`. `cnt` is `i+2` if `s >= l[i]`, otherwise it retains its value. `mx` is `max(mx, i+2)` if `s >= l[i]`, otherwise it retains its value. If `l[i] < abs(h[0])`, `h` now contains `-l[i]` as its smallest element, otherwise `h` retains its original smallest element.***
