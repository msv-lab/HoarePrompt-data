`happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times, and now the code appends another `1` to this list. Therefore, the length of `happiness` is now `n+1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`costs` is [0], `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+1` times, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `earnings` is unchanged**
