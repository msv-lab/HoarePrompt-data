The `costs` list had its last element removed using the `pop()` method. Since the last element of `costs` was less than or equal to `earnings`, after removing it, the condition that the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings` still holds true. The `happiness` list and the value of `i` remain unchanged. The `earnings` variable is updated to `earnings - costs[-1]`, but since the last element was just removed, `earnings` is now effectively `earnings - (the last element of costs before pop)`. 

Output State: **`costs` is a non-empty list with its last element less than or equal to `earnings`; `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+3` times; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `earnings` is `earnings - (the last element of costs before pop)`**
