The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Since the initial state does not provide the initial content of `happiness`, we can only say that `1` is added to it. The variables `earnings` and `costs` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`earnings` is `E - C[-1]`, `costs` is the same as before, `happiness` is a list containing at least the value `1`.**
