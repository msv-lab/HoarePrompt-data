The code snippet updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. Given the initial state, `mx` is initially 1 and `cnt` is 2.

Let's analyze the impact:

1. The current value of `mx` is 1.
2. The current value of `cnt` is 2.
3. The code sets `mx` to the maximum of `mx` (which is 1) and `cnt` (which is 2).

Since 2 is greater than 1, `mx` will be updated to 2.

No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is `s + m - l[i-1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 2, `mx` is 2, `h` is a list containing `-l[i+1]` if `s < l[i+1]` and also contains `-l[i]`.**
