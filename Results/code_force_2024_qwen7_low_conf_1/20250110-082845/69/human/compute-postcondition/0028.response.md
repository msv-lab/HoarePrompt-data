Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings`.
   - The loop continues as long as `costs` is not empty (`costs`) and the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings` (`costs[-1] <= earnings`).

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `earnings` is `E`.
   - `costs` has had its last element removed, meaning `costs` is now one element shorter than before.
   - `happiness` has an additional element `1` added to it.

3. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `costs` must still not be empty, and the last element of `costs` must still be less than or equal to `earnings`.
   - Since `costs` has had its last element removed, `costs` will be empty if the previous last element was the only element left in `costs`. Therefore, `costs` must have had more than one element before the removal for the loop to continue.
   - The last element of `costs` before the removal must have been less than or equal to `earnings`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `costs` must not be empty after the removal of the last element. This means the original `costs` must have had at least two elements, and the current `costs` must have at least one element.
   - The last element of the original `costs` (which is now the second-to-last element of the current `costs`) must have been less than or equal to `earnings`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `costs` must have at least one element.
- The last element of the original `costs` (now the second-to-last element of the current `costs`) must be less than or equal to `earnings`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`earnings` is `E`, `costs` has at least one element, and the second-to-last element of the original `costs` must be less than or equal to `E`**
