`s` is decreased by `l[i]`. The value of `l[i]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `s` after the subtraction, but we know it has been reduced by `l[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated by subtracting `l[i]`, `cnt` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, and `h` retains its state unless the condition `l[i] < abs(h[0])` is true**
