Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States:
- `m` is a positive integer (no change needed as it doesn't affect the loop condition)
- `x` is a positive integer such that the last element of `costs` is less than `x` (no change needed as it doesn't affect the loop condition)
- `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order without its last element
- `earnings` is `x - costs[-1]` if `costs` is not empty, otherwise `x`
- `happiness` is `[1]`
- `i` is 1

### Loop Condition:
```
while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**:
   - The loop continues as long as `costs` is not empty (`costs`) and the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings` (`costs[-1] <= earnings`).

2. **Current Values**:
   - `costs` is non-empty (since `i` is 1, we assume there is at least one element in `costs`).
   - The last element of `costs` is less than `x`.
   - `earnings` is calculated based on the current `costs` and `x`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirement**:
   - For the loop to continue, `costs[-1]` must still be less than or equal to `earnings`.
   - Since `costs` is sorted in descending order, removing the last element (which is the smallest) should still satisfy the condition if the next smallest element is still less than or equal to `earnings`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - After one iteration, `costs` will lose its last element, reducing the list by one.
   - We need to ensure that the new last element of `costs` (the second-to-last element from the original list) is still less than or equal to `earnings`.

5. **New `costs` State**:
   - After removing the last element, the new `costs` should still satisfy the condition `costs[-1] <= earnings`.

### Conclusion:
The state that needs to be adjusted is `costs`, specifically ensuring that the new last element of `costs` (after one iteration) is still less than or equal to `earnings`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that the last element of `costs` is less than `x`, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order without its last element, `earnings` is `x - costs[-1]` if `costs` is not empty, otherwise `x`, `happiness` is `[1]`, `i` is 2 and the new last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`**.
