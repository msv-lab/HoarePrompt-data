`earnings` is incremented by `x`. The value of `costs` remains empty, `happiness` remains a list containing `1` repeated `n` times, and `i` remains `i_end + 2`. Therefore, the only updated variable is `earnings`.

Output State: **`costs` is empty, `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
