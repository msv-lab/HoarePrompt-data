`cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The values of `rs`, `s`, `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `mx`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is `s + m - l[i-1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 2, `mx` is 1, `h` is a list containing `-l[i+1]` if `s < l[i+1]` and also contains `-l[i]`.**
