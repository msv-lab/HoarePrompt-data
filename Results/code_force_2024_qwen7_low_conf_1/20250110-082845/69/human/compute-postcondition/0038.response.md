`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. Initially, `costs` is `[0]`. After calling `pop()`, the last element (which is `0`) is removed, leaving `costs` as an empty list `[]`.

The other variables (`earnings`, `happiness`, `i`, and `i_end`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`costs` is `[]`, `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+1` times, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
