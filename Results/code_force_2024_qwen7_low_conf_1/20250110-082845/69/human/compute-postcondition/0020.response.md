Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once.

### Given Loop Condition:
```
while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial States:
- `m` is a positive integer
- `x` is a positive integer
- `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order
- `earnings` is `x + (x - n * costs[-1])`
- `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times
- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `m + 1` must be greater than 1

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   The loop condition is `costs and costs[-1] <= earnings`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `costs` is non-empty (`costs` exists and is not empty).
   - `costs[-1]` is the last element in the `costs` list.
   - `earnings` is given by `x + (x - n * costs[-1])`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute:**
   - The list `costs` must not be empty, which is already satisfied as per the initial state.
   - The condition `costs[-1] <= earnings` must be true for the loop to execute.

4. **Evaluating `earnings`:**
   - `earnings = x + (x - n * costs[-1]) = 2x - n * costs[-1]`.
   - For the loop to execute, we need `costs[-1] <= 2x - n * costs[-1]`.

5. **Simplifying the Condition:**
   - Rearrange the inequality: `costs[-1] + n * costs[-1] <= 2x`.
   - Combine like terms: `(n + 1) * costs[-1] <= 2x`.
   - Solve for `costs[-1]`: `costs[-1] <= (2x) / (n + 1)`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The current value of `costs[-1]` needs to satisfy the condition `costs[-1] <= (2x) / (n + 1)` for the loop to execute at least once.

### Final Answer:
The state right before the loop needs to be adjusted such that `costs[-1]` is less than or equal to `(2x) / (n + 1)`.

**State:** **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is `x + (x - n * costs[-1])`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and `costs[-1]` must be less than or equal to `(2x) / (n + 1)`**
