`earnings` is decremented by the value of `costs[-1]`. Since `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, the last element of `costs` (i.e., `costs[-1]`) is the largest value in the list. The value of `earnings` was originally `x`, and it is now decreased by this largest cost. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `x`, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is `x - costs[-1]`, `happiness` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
