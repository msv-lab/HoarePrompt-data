`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since the smallest element is removed, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is 0, `i` must be less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated to `s + abs(h[0]) - l[i]`, `cnt` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, and `h` is now a heap without its smallest element.
