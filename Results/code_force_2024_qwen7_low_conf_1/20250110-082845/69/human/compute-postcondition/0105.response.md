The code initializes an empty list `h`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `rs` is 0, `s` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `mx` is 0, `h` is an empty list, and `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `mx` is 0, `h` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.**
