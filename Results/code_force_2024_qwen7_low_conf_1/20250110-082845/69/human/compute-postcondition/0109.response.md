The code `heapq.heappush(h, -l[i])` pushes the negative value of `l[i]` onto the heap `h`. Since `i` is less than `n` and `l` is a list of integers, `l[i]` is an integer from the list `l`. The heap `h` now contains one element, which is `-l[i]`.

- The value of `rs` remains 0.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
- The value of `cnt` remains 0 because the code does not modify it.
- The value of `mx` remains 0 because the code does not modify it.
- The value of `h` is updated to include the new element `-l[i]`.

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is a value equal to the initial value of `s` minus `l[i]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `mx` is 0, `h` is a list containing `-l[i]`.**
