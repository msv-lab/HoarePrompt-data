The code initializes an empty list named `happiness`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`m`, `x`, `costs`, and `earnings`). Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `happiness` list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months, `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is 0, and `happiness` is an empty list.**
