`earnings` is initially \( E - \) the new last element of `costs`, and `costs` is the same as before except the last element is removed. The last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`.

The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` subtracts the last element of `costs` from `earnings`. Since the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`, this operation will update the value of `earnings` accordingly.

Output State: **`earnings` is \( E - \) the new last element of `costs`, `costs` is the same as before except the last element is removed, and the updated value of `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`.**
