The `heapq.heappop(h)` function removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `h` is determined by the expressions in the initial state, specifically `h` contains `-l[i+1]` if `s < l[i+1]`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `i`, and `s` are not provided, we will consider the general case where `h` contains elements derived from these conditions.

After executing `heapq.heappop(h)`, the smallest element from `h` is removed, and its value is returned. This returned value will be stored in a temporary variable since `heapq.heappop()` does not assign the popped value back to `h` directly. However, the smallest element's value is still needed for further analysis.

Let's denote the smallest element popped from `h` as `pop_val`.

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is `s + m + (abs(-l[i+1]) - l[i])` if `s < l[i+1]`, else `s` is `s + m - l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1, `h` is a list without the smallest element, `pop_val` is the smallest element popped from `h`**
