The `pop()` method removes the last element from the `costs` list. This impacts the `costs` list by reducing its length by one and removing the last element. The `earnings` variable is defined as `E - costs[-1]`, which means it was originally calculated based on the second-to-last element of the `costs` list. After popping the last element, the second-to-last element becomes the new last element. 

Since `earnings` was previously defined as `E - costs[-1]`, after the `pop()` operation, `earnings` would now be `E - (costs[-1] - 1)`, assuming the popped element was the last element. However, without knowing the exact value of the last element before popping, we cannot simplify this further.

The `happiness` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`earnings` is `E - (costs[-1] - 1)`, `costs` has at least one element less than before, and `happiness` contains at least the value `1`.**
