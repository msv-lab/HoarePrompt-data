The last element of the `costs` list is subtracted from `earnings`. Since `costs` is a non-empty list and its last element is less than or equal to `earnings`, `earnings` will be updated by subtracting the last element of `costs`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`costs` is a non-empty list with its last element less than or equal to `earnings`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+2` times, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`**
