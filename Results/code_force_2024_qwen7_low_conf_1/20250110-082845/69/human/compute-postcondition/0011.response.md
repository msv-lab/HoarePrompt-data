The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. The initial value of `happiness` is `[1]`. After appending `1`, the list `happiness` becomes `[1, 1]`.

The values of the other variables (`m`, `x`, `costs`, `earnings`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order without its last element, `earnings` is `x - 2 * costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1, 1]`, `i` is 2**
