Postcondition: ***`rs` is 0, `s` is updated according to whether `s >= l[i]` holds true. If `s >= l[i]`, then `s` becomes `s - l[i]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1, and `h` is a list containing `-l[i]`. If `s < l[i]`, then `s` remains unchanged, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `mx` is 0, and `h` contains `-l[i]` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])`, otherwise `h` remains an empty list, and `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.***
