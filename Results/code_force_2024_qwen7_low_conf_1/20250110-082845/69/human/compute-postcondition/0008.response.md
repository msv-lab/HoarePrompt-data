`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. The last element of `costs` was less than or equal to `x`, and since it is removed, the new last element (if any) will be smaller than the previous last element. The `earnings` and `happiness` variables are not affected by this operation. The value of `m` and `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that the last element of `costs` is less than `x`, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order without its last element, `earnings` is `x - costs[-1]` if `costs` is not empty, otherwise `x`, `happiness` is `[1]`, `i` is 1**
