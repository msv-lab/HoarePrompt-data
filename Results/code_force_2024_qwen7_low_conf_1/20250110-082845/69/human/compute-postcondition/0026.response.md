`happiness` is a list that gets a new element appended to it, specifically the value `1`. The last element of `costs` is removed, and `earnings` is updated to be its current value minus the previous last element of `costs`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`earnings` is `E - costs[-1]`, `costs` is the same as before except the last element is removed, `happiness` is a list with an additional element `1`, and the other variables remain unchanged.**
