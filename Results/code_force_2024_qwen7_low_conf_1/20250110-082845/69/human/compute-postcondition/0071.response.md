Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` and `n` are integers where `n` is greater than 0. If `s >= l[i]` and `i` becomes 1, then `s` is updated to `s - l[1]`, `-l[1]` is pushed onto the heap `h`, `cnt` is 1, and `mx` is 1. Otherwise, `i` remains 0, `s` is updated to `s + 1 - l[0]`, and if `l[i] < abs(h[0])`, `-l[0]` is pushed onto the heap `h`. In both cases, `h` remains a heap and the other variables retain their initial states or the updated values accordingly.***
