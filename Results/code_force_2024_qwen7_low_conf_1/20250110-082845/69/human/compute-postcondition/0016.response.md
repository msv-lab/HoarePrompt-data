`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. The last element of `costs` was less than or equal to `earnings`, which means it was removed. All other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `m` is a positive integer (unchanged)
- `x` is a positive integer (unchanged)
- `costs` has at least one element remaining (last element removed)
- `earnings` is `x - 3 * costs[-1]` (unchanged because the last element is no longer in the list)
- `happiness` is `[1, 1, 1]` (unchanged)
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer; `x` is a positive integer; `costs` has at least one element remaining (last element removed); `earnings` is `x - 3 * costs[-1]`; `happiness` is `[1, 1, 1]`; `i` is 2**
