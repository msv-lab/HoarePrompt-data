Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings`.

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `costs` is an empty list (`[]`).
   - `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x`.
   - `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+1` times.
   - `i` is `i_end + 2`.

3. **Loop Condition Evaluation**:
   - For the loop to execute, both conditions in the `and` operator must be true:
     - `costs` should not be empty.
     - `costs[-1]` should be less than or equal to `earnings`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `costs` is currently an empty list, it cannot satisfy the first condition of the loop (`costs and costs[-1] <= earnings`).
   - To make the loop execute one more time, we need to ensure that `costs` is non-empty and that `costs[-1]` is less than or equal to `earnings`.

5. **Modifying the State**:
   - We need to add an element to `costs` to make it non-empty.
   - We need to ensure that the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `costs` must be a non-empty list.
- The last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`.

Given that `costs` is currently empty, we can add any element to `costs` to make it non-empty. For simplicity, let's assume we add a value `c` (which can be any value) to `costs`.

Final State:
State: **`costs` is a non-empty list with its last element less than or equal to `earnings`, `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+1` times, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
