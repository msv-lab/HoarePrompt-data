The `heapq.heappop(h)` function pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `rs` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
- `s` is updated as `s + m + (abs(h_0) - l_i)`, but this is not directly affected by the pop operation unless `h` contains the smallest element that was previously part of `s`.
- `i` is updated as `i + 1`, but this is not directly affected by the pop operation.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged because they are input integers and not part of the heap.
- `cnt` and `mx` remain unchanged because the pop operation does not affect these variables.
- `h` loses its smallest element, which could have been `-l[i+1]` if `s < l[i+1]` and possibly `-l[i]` under the condition that `l[i] < abs(h[0])`.

Since the smallest element is popped, we know that `h` no longer contains that element. However, without knowing the exact contents of `h` initially, we cannot specify the exact new contents of `h` except to say that it has lost its smallest element.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is `s + m + (abs(h_0) - l_i)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1, `h` is a list with its smallest element removed.**
