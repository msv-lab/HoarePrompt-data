The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m`, `x`, and `costs`. 
- `m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months.
- `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary.
- `costs` is a list of positive integers where `costs[i]` represents the cost to obtain one unit of happiness in the i-th month.

The function returns `m`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three parameters (`m`, `x`, and `costs`) and return `m`.
