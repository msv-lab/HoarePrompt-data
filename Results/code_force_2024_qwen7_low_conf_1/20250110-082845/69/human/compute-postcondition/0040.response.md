The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` subtracts the last element of the `costs` list from `earnings`. According to the initial state, the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`, and `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x`. After executing the code, `earnings` will be updated to `original_earnings + x - costs[-1]`.

Other variables remain unchanged: `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+1` times, and `i` is `i_end + 2`.

Output State: **`costs` is a non-empty list with its last element less than or equal to `earnings`, `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x` minus `costs[-1]`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+1` times, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
