The code `heapq.heappush(h, -l[i])` adds `-l[i]` to the heap `h`. Given the initial state, we know that `h` is a heap without its smallest element, `i` must be less than `n`, and `n` is greater than 0. After pushing `-l[i]` into the heap, the smallest element in the heap will be updated.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `h` is a heap, and now it contains `-l[i]` in addition to its previous elements (excluding the smallest one).
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged because the line that updates `s` is not present in the given code.
- The value of `cnt` remains unchanged because there is no operation that affects `cnt`.
- The value of `mx` remains unchanged because there is no operation that affects `mx`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated to `s + abs(h[0]) - l[i]`, `cnt` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, and `h` is a heap with the additional element `-l[i]`.**
