The code `costs.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `costs` in descending order. This means the highest cost will now be the first element in the list, and the lowest cost will be the last element. The variables `m` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months, `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, and `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order.**
