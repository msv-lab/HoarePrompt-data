`cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated state is as follows: `total` is 0; `i` must be less than `n`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is updated to `s - l[i]`; `cnt` is increased by 1; `mx` retains its value; and `h` is a heap with an additional element `-l[i]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `i` must be less than `n`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is updated to `s - l[i]`; `cnt` is increased by 1; `mx` retains its value; and `h` is a heap with an additional element `-l[i]`.**
