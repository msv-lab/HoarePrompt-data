`cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `total` is 0, `i` is `i+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated by subtracting `l[i]`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `mx` retains its value, and `-l[i]` is pushed onto the heap `h`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated by subtracting `l[i]`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `mx` retains its value, and `-l[i]` is pushed onto the heap `h`.**
