Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m`, `x`, and `costs`. 
- `m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months.
- `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary.
- `costs` is a list of positive integers where `costs[i]` represents the cost to obtain one unit of happiness in the i-th month.

The function sorts the `costs` list in descending order. It then iterates over the months from 1 to `m`, accumulating the total earnings by adding `x` (monthly salary) for each month. Within each iteration, it checks if the last element in the `costs` list is less than or equal to the current accumulated earnings. If true, it subtracts the cost from the earnings and appends 1 to the `happiness` list, indicating one unit of happiness was obtained, and removes the cost from the `costs` list. This process continues until either no more costs can be subtracted from the earnings or the loop completes.

After the loop, the function returns the length of the `happiness` list, which is guaranteed to be `m` because the loop runs exactly `m` times and appends 1 to the `happiness` list each time. Therefore, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program returns `m`, indicating the total number of units of happiness that could be obtained given the constraints.**

Potential edge cases:
- If `costs` is an empty list, the function will simply return `m` without performing any operations inside the loop.
- If the cost to obtain happiness in any month is greater than the total earnings at any point, the loop will not append anything to the `happiness` list for that month. However, since the loop runs `m` times, the final return value will still be `m`.
