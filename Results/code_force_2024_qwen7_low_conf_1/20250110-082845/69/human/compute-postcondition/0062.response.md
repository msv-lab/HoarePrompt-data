The code `mx = max(mx, cnt)` updates `mx` to be the maximum value between `mx` and `cnt`. Initially, `cnt` is increased by 1. Since `cnt` was not specified to have an initial value other than being increased by 1, we assume it starts from 0. Thus, after the increase, `cnt` is 1.

Given that `mx` is not specified with an initial value in the precondition, we assume `mx` is also initially 0 (the default value for `max` when no arguments are provided). After the line of code executes, `mx` will be updated to 1 because `max(0, 1)` equals 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s - l[1]`, and `-l[1]` is pushed onto the heap `h`; `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1**
