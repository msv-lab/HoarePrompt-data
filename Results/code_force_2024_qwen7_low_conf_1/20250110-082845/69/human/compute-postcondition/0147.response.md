The code `rs.append(cnt)` appends the current value of `cnt` to the list `rs`. Since `rs` was initially 0 (which implies it is a list), appending `cnt` to it means `rs` now contains the value of `cnt`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`rs` is `[cnt]`, `s` is `s + n * m`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive elements added to `s` without violating the condition `s >= l[i]`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, and `h` is a heap containing `-l[i]` for all valid `i` where `s < l[i]` and `l[i] < abs(h[0])`.**
