`cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` was 1, so now `cnt` is 2. The values of the other variables (`rs`, `s`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `mx`, and `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is `s - l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 2, `mx` is 1, `h` is a heap containing `-l[i]`**
