The `costs` list has its last element removed using the `pop()` method. The value of `earnings` is defined as `E - C[-1]`, which means `earnings` is equal to `E -` the last element of the `costs` list before the `pop()` operation. After the `pop()` operation, the last element no longer exists in the `costs` list, and `earnings` will be recalculated as `E -` the new last element (or the second-to-last element before the `pop()` operation). However, since the exact values of `E` and the elements of `costs` are not provided, we know that `earnings` will be updated to `E -` the new last element of `costs`. The `happiness` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`earnings` is `E -` the new last element of `costs`, `costs` is the same as before except the last element is removed, `happiness` is a list containing at least the value `1`.**
