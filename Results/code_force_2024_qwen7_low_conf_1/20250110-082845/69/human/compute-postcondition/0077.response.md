The code `mx = max(mx, cnt)` updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. Given that `cnt` is increased by 1 in the initial state, the value of `cnt` is now `1` (since it was initially increased by 1). The value of `mx` remains unchanged from its previous state because no specific value for `mx` was given, and it is not mentioned whether `mx` was previously greater than or equal to `cnt`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0; `i` must be less than `n`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is updated to `s - l[i]`; `cnt` is 1; `mx` retains its previous value; and `h` is a heap with an additional element `-l[i]`.**
