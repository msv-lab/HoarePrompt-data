The code `heapq.heappush(h, -l[i])` pushes the negation of `l[i]` onto the heap `h`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `l` or `i`, we know that `l[i]` is pushed onto the heap, but the exact value is unknown.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `h` is updated by pushing `-l[i]` onto the heap.
- No other variables are directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is `s + m + (abs(-l[i+1]) - l[i])` if `s < l[i+1]`, else `s` is `s + m - l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1, `h` contains `-l[i]`, `pop_val` is the smallest element popped from `h`.**
