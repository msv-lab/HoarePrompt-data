The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. The length of `happiness` was previously `n+1`, so now it will be `n+2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `costs` is a non-empty list with its last element less than or equal to `earnings`.
- `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x` minus `costs[-1]`.
- `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+2` times.
- `i` is `i_end + 2`.

Output State: **`costs` is a non-empty list with its last element less than or equal to `earnings`; `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x` minus `costs[-1]`; `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+2` times; `i` is `i_end + 2`.**
