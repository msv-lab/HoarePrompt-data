Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `costs` is empty.
   - `earnings` is the original value of `earnings`.
   - `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times.
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, m + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will iterate from `1` to `m`.
   - The loop variable `i` will start from `i_end + 1`.

4. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently `i_end + 1`, the loop will only execute if `i_end + 1` is within the range `1` to `m`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `i_end + 2`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `costs` remains empty as no costs are added in the loop body.
   - `earnings` remains the original value of `earnings` as no changes are made to it in the loop body.
   - `happiness` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it in the loop body.
   - `i` will be `i_end + 2`.

Based on the above analysis, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`costs` is empty, `earnings` is the original value of `earnings`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
