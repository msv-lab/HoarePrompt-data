Let's break down the task step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is the length of the list `l`.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is 0.
- `h` is an empty list.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `mx` is 0.
- `rs` is a list containing at least one element which is `cnt`.
- `l` is a list of integers created from the input.

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 and will iterate from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` should be 0 (the initial value).

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `m`, `s`, `h`, `cnt`, `mx`, and `rs` do not affect the loop execution directly based on the provided code snippet.

### Adjusted States:
Based on the analysis, we need to ensure that the loop can start by setting `i` to its initial value and ensuring that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`total` is not relevant here, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**.

However, since the question specifically asks for the states to be adjusted and includes the variable `total` from previous examples, we should include it in the answer as well even though it is not relevant here:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing with the correct initial values for `i` and `n`.
