The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` subtracts the last element of the `costs` list from `earnings`. Given the initial state:

- `earnings` is `x - 2 * costs[-1]`
- `costs` must have at least one element remaining and the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`

After executing the line `earnings -= costs[-1]`, `earnings` becomes `earnings - costs[-1]`.

Since `earnings` is initially defined as `x - 2 * costs[-1]`, after the subtraction, the new value of `earnings` will be `(x - 2 * costs[-1]) - costs[-1]`, which simplifies to `x - 3 * costs[-1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` must have at least one element remaining and the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`, `earnings` is `x - 3 * costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1, 1]`, `i` is 2**
