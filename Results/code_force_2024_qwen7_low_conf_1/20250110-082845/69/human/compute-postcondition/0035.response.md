Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute at least once.

### Given Information:
- `costs` is an empty list.
- `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x`.
- `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times.
- `i` is `i_end + 2`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **`costs`**: The list `costs` is currently empty. For the loop condition `costs and costs[-1] <= earnings` to be true, `costs` must be non-empty. Since `costs` is empty now, we need to add at least one element to `costs` such that the condition holds.
   
2. **`costs[-1]`**: Since `costs` is empty, there is no `-1` index to check. Therefore, adding an element to `costs` such that `costs[-1]` is less than or equal to `earnings` will make the loop condition true.

3. **`earnings`**: The value of `earnings` is `original_earnings + x`. We don't need to change this as it already meets the condition of being a valid comparison.

4. **Other States**: The values of `happiness` and `i` do not affect the loop condition and do not need adjustment.

### Conclusion:
To make the loop execute at least once, we need to add at least one element to `costs` such that `costs[-1] <= earnings`. Since `costs` is currently empty, adding any value to `costs` will satisfy the condition as long as it is less than or equal to `earnings`.

### State Adjustment:
- Add at least one element to `costs` such that `costs[-1] <= earnings`.

Given that `costs` is currently empty, let's assume we add an element `0` (or any other valid value) to `costs` to satisfy the condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`costs` is [0], `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` plus `x`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n` times, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
