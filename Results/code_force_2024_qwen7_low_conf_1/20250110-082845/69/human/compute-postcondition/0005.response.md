Let's break down the given conditions and analyze the loop to determine what needs to be adjusted:

### Given Conditions:
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a positive integer.
- `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `earnings` is `0 + x`, which simplifies to `x`.
- `happiness` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- `m + 1` must be greater than 1 (which is always true since `m` is a positive integer).

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs as long as `costs` is not empty (`costs`) and the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings` (`costs[-1] <= earnings`).

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1:** `costs` should not be empty.
   - This condition is already met since `costs` is non-empty based on the problem statement.

2. **Condition 2:** `costs[-1] <= earnings`.
   - Here, `earnings` is `x`.
   - For the loop to proceed, the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `x`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute at least once, the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `x`. 

### Final State:
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a positive integer such that the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `x`.
- `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `earnings` is `x`.
- `happiness` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.

Thus, the required adjustment is:
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `x`, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is `x`, `happiness` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
