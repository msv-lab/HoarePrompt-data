The code updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. Initially, `mx` is 0 and `cnt` is 1. Since `cnt` (which is 1) is greater than `mx` (which is 0), `mx` will be updated to 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is a value equal to the initial value of `s` minus `l[i]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1, `h` is a list containing `-l[i]`.**
