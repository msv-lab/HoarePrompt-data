Postcondition: **`rs` is 0, `s` is updated based on the condition: if `s >= l[i]`, then `s` is reduced by `l[i]`; otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + m + (abs(h[0]) - l[i])` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])`. `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 2, `mx` is 2, and `h` is a heap containing `-l[i]` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])`.**
