Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `i+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is updated by adding `abs(l[i]) - h[0]` to its current value if `l[i] < abs(h[0])`; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged, `cnt` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, and `h` now contains `-l[i]` as its smallest element if `l[i] < abs(h[0])`. If `l[i] >= abs(h[0])`, the values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `cnt`, `mx`, and `h` remain unchanged.***
