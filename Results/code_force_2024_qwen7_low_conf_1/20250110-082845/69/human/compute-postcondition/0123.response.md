`s` is decreased by `l[i]`. The initial state is `rs` is 0, `s` is `s + m`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1, `h` is a list containing `-l[i+1]` if `s < l[i+1]`.

- `rs` remains 0 because there is no operation affecting it.
- `s` is updated to `s - l[i]`.
- `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
- `n` remains an input integer because it was not affected.
- `m` remains an input integer because it was not affected.
- `cnt` remains 1 because it was not affected.
- `mx` remains 1 because it was not affected.
- `h` is a list containing `-l[i+1]` if `s < l[i+1]`. Since `s` is updated to `s - l[i]`, the condition for `h` might change.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `s` is `s + m - l[i]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `h` is a list containing `-l[i+1]` if `s < l[i+1]`.

Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is `s + m - l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1, `h` is a list containing `-l[i+1]` if `s < l[i+1]`**.
