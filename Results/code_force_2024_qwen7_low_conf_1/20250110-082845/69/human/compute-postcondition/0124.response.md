The code snippet `heapq.heappush(h, -l[i])` impacts the variable `h` by pushing `-l[i]` onto the heap. From the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1 (though the new value of `i` is not directly used in this operation), `s` is updated to `s + m - l[i-1]`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1, and `h` is a list containing `-l[i+1]` if `s < l[i+1]`.

Since `heapq.heappush` modifies the heap in-place, the impact on `h` is that it now contains an additional element, specifically `-l[i]`. Given that `i` was incremented before this line, we can express `-l[i]` as `-l[(i-1)+1]` which simplifies to `-l[i]` being the new element added to the heap.

The output state after executing the code snippet is:
Output State: **`rs` is 0, `s` is `s + m - l[i-1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1, `h` is a list containing `-l[i+1]` if `s < l[i+1]` and also contains `-l[i]`.**
