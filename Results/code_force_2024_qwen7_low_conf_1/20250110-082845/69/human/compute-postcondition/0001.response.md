The code initializes the variable `earnings` to 0. This does not affect the values of `m`, `x`, or `costs`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `earnings`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months, `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `earnings` is 0.**
