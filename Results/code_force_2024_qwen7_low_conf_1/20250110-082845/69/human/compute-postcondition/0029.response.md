`earnings` is decreased by the last element of `costs`. Since the second-to-last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `E`, the precondition that `costs` has at least one element remains true. Therefore, the Output State is: `earnings` is `E - costs[-1]`, `costs` has at least one element, and the second-to-last element of the original `costs` is less than or equal to `E`.

Output State: **`earnings` is `E - costs[-1]`, `costs` has at least one element, and the second-to-last element of the original `costs` is less than or equal to `E`**
