Postcondition: ***`rs` is 0, `s` is updated to either `s + m + (abs(-l[i+1]) - l[i])` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` and `s < l[i+1]`, or `s + m - l[i]` otherwise. `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `mx` is 1, and `h` contains `-l[i]` if `s < l[i+1]` under the condition that `l[i] < abs(h[0])`.***
