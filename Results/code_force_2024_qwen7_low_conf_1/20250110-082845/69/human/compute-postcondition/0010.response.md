The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` means that the value of `earnings` is decreased by the last element of the `costs` list. 

From the initial state:
- `m` is a positive integer
- `x` is a positive integer such that the last element of `costs` is less than `x`
- `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order without its last element
- `earnings` is `x - costs[-1]` if `costs` is not empty, otherwise `x`
- `happiness` is `[1]`
- `i` is 2
- The new last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`

Since `earnings` is defined as `x - costs[-1]` (because `costs` is not empty), the subtraction operation `earnings -= costs[-1]` will effectively subtract `costs[-1]` from itself, resulting in `earnings` being reduced by `costs[-1]`. 

Let's denote the initial value of `costs[-1]` as `c`. So initially, `earnings = x - c`. After executing `earnings -= costs[-1]`, the new value of `earnings` will be `(x - c) - c = x - 2c`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order without its last element, `earnings` is `x - 2 * costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1]`, `i` is 2**
