Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `x` is a positive integer.
   - `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, excluding its last element.
   - `earnings` is `x - 2 * costs[-1]`.
   - `happiness` is `[1, 1]`.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop condition is `while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings:`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute again, two conditions must be met:
     1. `costs` should not be empty (i.e., `costs` must exist).
     2. The last element of `costs` should be less than or equal to `earnings`.

4. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - We know that `i` is 2, but we don't know how many iterations have occurred.
   - The loop might have executed zero, one, or multiple times, but we need to ensure it can execute one more time.

5. **Conditions to Adjust**:
   - Since `costs` is a list, and we need to ensure it has at least one element left, we need to ensure that `costs` is non-empty.
   - We also need to ensure that the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - To ensure `costs` is non-empty, we need to adjust `costs` to have at least one element remaining.
   - To ensure the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`, we need to adjust `costs[-1]` to be less than or equal to `earnings`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values, we need to ensure the conditions are met generally. Therefore, we need to adjust `costs` such that it still meets the loop condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `costs` must have at least one element remaining and the last element of `costs` must be less than or equal to `earnings`, `earnings` is `x - 2 * costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1, 1]`, `i` is 2**
