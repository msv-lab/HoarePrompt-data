To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `costs` is a non-empty list with its last element less than or equal to `earnings`.
   - `earnings` is updated as the original value of `earnings` plus `x` minus the new last element of `costs`.
   - `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+2` times.
   - `i` is `i_end + 2`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `costs` is non-empty and the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `costs` is a non-empty list.
   - The last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`.
   - `happiness` remains unchanged from the previous state (a list containing `1` repeated `n+2` times).
   - `i` is now `i_end + 2`.

For the loop to continue executing one more time, two conditions must be met:
- `costs` must remain non-empty.
- The last element of `costs` must remain less than or equal to `earnings`.

Since `costs` is a non-empty list at the current state, we only need to ensure that the last element of `costs` remains within the condition `costs[-1] <= earnings`.

The `earnings` value has already been updated in the previous iteration based on the last element of `costs`, and it will remain the same unless modified inside the loop. Therefore, no additional adjustments to `earnings` are necessary.

Given these considerations, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue if the last element of `costs` remains less than or equal to `earnings` and `costs` remains non-empty.

State: **`costs` is a non-empty list with its last element less than or equal to `earnings`, `happiness` is a list containing `1` repeated `n+2` times, `i` is `i_end + 2`**
