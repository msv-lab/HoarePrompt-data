t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, x are positive integers such that 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \leq x, k \leq n. Additionally, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where 1 \leq a_i \leq 1000 represents the elements of the array. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
