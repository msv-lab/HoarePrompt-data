`p` is assigned the value `-10 ** 5`. This overwrites the previous value of `p`, which was printed. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1` if `n + 1` is within the loop range or `n - k` if `n - k` is the last value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input and sorted in ascending order, `q` is `[0]`, `p` is `-10 ** 5`, the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` calculated during the loop, `n + 1 < t` or `n - k < t`, input has been taken for `a`, `a` is now sorted in ascending order.
