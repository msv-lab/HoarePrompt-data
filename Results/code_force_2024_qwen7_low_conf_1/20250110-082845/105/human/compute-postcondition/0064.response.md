The code `l = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `l`. This changes the value of `l` from either `0` or `n - k - x` to `0`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `m`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`, `l` is 0, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`, if `m > p` then `p` is updated to `m`, otherwise `p` remains unchanged.**
