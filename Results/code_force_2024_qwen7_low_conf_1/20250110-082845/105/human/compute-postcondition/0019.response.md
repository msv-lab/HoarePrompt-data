The initial state is that `R()` returns a non-empty list, and `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned values from `R()`. The code snippet provided is `a += a[-1] + y`. Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step:

1. `a += a[-1] + y`: This line increments the last element of the list `a` by the sum of the last element of `a` (which is `a[-1]`) and `y`.

2. Since `y` is not defined in the provided code and we don't know its value, we cannot specify its exact value. However, we can say that `y` is one of the elements returned by `R()`.

3. The value of `a` is updated, but the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`R()` returns a non-empty list, `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned values from `R()`, `a` is updated such that each element is incremented by the sum of the previous element and `y`, where `y` is one of the elements returned by `R()`**.
