`t` is decremented by 1. The initial state was that `t` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0. After subtracting 1, `t` will be one less than its initial value, but it will still be a positive integer since it started as a positive integer greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, which is a positive integer**
