Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `n` is the same
   - `k` is the same
   - `x` is the same
   - `y` is the next value from the sorted output of `R()`
   - `a` is `[0, y, 2*y]`

2. The code snippet `a += a[-1] + y` modifies the list `a`.
   - `a[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `a`, which is `2*y`.
   - Adding `a[-1]` (which is `2*y`) to `y` gives `2*y + y = 3*y`.
   - So, `a` is updated by appending `3*y` to itself.

3. After executing the code, `a` will be `[0, y, 2*y, 3*y]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the same, `k` is the same, `x` is the same, `y` is the next value from the sorted output of `R()`, `a` is `[0, y, 2*y, 3*y]`**
