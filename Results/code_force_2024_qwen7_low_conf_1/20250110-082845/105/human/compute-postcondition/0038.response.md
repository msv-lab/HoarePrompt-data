Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are the values returned by `R()` in the last iteration, `a` is a list where `a[0] = 0` and for every index `i` from 1 to `m`, `a[i] = a[i-1] + y_i`, and the maximum value of `2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i]` for `i` in the range `n - k` to `n + 1` has been computed.**
