`l` is reassigned the value `i - x`. The previous value of `l` was `n - x` under certain conditions. Now, `l` is updated to `i - x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list such that `q[0] = 0` and for each `j` from 1 to `n`, `q[j] = q[j-1] + a[j-1]`, `l` is `i - x`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n - 1]`, and `m` is greater than `p`.**
