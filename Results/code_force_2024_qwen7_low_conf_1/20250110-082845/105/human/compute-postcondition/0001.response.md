`t` is assigned the value returned by the function `R()`. The function `R()` takes input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string to an integer. Since the initial state is that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, after the execution of the line `t, = R()`, `t` will be set to the first integer from the input, which is the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer from the input (the number of test cases), and the rest of the input is stored in a list of strings.**
