The code `p = m` assigns the value of `m` to `p`. Based on the initial state, `m` is defined as `2 * q[l] - q[n - k + 2]`. Since `p` is only updated if `2 * q[l] - q[n - k + 2] > p`, the value of `p` is now equal to `m`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `i` remains `n - k + 2`
- `l` remains `0` if `n - k + 2 - x < 1` or `(n - k + 2) - x` if `n - k + 2 - x >= 1`
- `m` remains `2 * q[l] - q[n - k + 2]`
- `p` is now equal to `m`

Output State: **`i` is `n - k + 2`; `l` is `0` if `n - k + 2 - x < 1` or `(n - k + 2) - x` if `n - k + 2 - x >= 1`; `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n - k + 2]`; `p` is equal to `m`**
