Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - k + 2`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input and sorted in ascending order.
   - `q` is `[0, a[i-1], a[i-1] + a[i]]`.
   - `p` is `-10`.

2. Code: `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])`

   - The code appends a new element to the list `q`. The new element is the sum of the last element of `q` and `a[i]`.
   - The last element of `q` is `a[i-1] + a[i]` (since `q` is initialized as `[0, a[i-1], a[i-1] + a[i]]`).
   - Therefore, the new element appended to `q` is `(a[i-1] + a[i]) + (a[i-1] + a[i]) = 2 * (a[i-1] + a[i])`.

3. Updated State:
   - `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` remains unchanged as `n - k + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as an input integer.
   - `k` remains unchanged as an input integer greater than 1.
   - `x` remains unchanged as an input integer.
   - `a` remains unchanged as a list of integers read from input and sorted in ascending order.
   - `q` now has one additional element, which is `2 * (a[i-1] + a[i])`.
   - `p` remains unchanged as `-10`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is `n - k + 2`; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer greater than 1; `x` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from input and sorted in ascending order; `q` is `[0, a[i-1], a[i-1] + a[i], 2 * (a[i-1] + a[i])]`; `p` is `-10`.**
