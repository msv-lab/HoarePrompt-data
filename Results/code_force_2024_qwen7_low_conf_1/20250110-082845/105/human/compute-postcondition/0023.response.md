The code `a += a[-1] + y,` updates the list `a` by appending the value of `a[-1] + y` to the end of the list. Here, `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`, and `y` is the smallest remaining element in the sorted list.

Given the initial state:
- `R()` returns a non-empty list.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned values from `R()`.
- The sorted list from `R()` must have at least two elements for the next iteration.
- `a` has a length of one more than its previous length.
- `y` is the smallest remaining element in the sorted list.

Since `a` has a length of one more than its previous length and `y` is the smallest remaining element in the sorted list, let's denote the last element of `a` before the operation as `last_element`. After the operation, `a` will have `last_element + y` appended to it.

Output State: **`R()` returns a non-empty list, `n` is assigned a value from `R()`, `k` is assigned a value from `R()`, `x` is assigned a value from `R()`, the sorted list from `R()` must have at least two elements for the next iteration, `a` has a length of one more than its previous length with the new element being `a[-1] + y`, and `y` is the smallest remaining element in the sorted list.**
