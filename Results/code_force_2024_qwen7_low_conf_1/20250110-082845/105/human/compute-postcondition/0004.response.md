`t` is a positive integer and is initially `t - 1`. The code assigns the result of `R()` (which returns three values) to `n`, `k`, and `x`. Since the exact values returned by `R()` are not specified, we can only state that `n`, `k`, and `x` are the values returned by `R()`. The value of `t` remains as `t - 1` because no operation directly modifies `t` in the given code.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are the values returned by `R()`**
