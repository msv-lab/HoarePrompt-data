`l` is assigned the value of `i - x`. The initial state shows that `i` is `n - k`, and the condition `i - x >= 1` must hold true. After the code executes, the value of `i` remains `n - k`, and the value of `l` becomes `n - k - x`. The conditions and relationships between the variables remain valid.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k`; `l` is `n - k - x`; `n - k` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`; `i - x >= 1`**
