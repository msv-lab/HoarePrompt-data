Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - k`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input and sorted in ascending order.
- `q` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], a[0] + a[1] + a[2], ..., a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1]]`.
- `p` is `-10`.

### Loop Condition:
The for loop runs over the range `range(n - k, n + 1)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `n - k`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range specified by the loop condition (`n - k` to `n + 1`).
   
2. **Loop Execution Range:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, the minimum value `i` can take is `n - k` (which is the starting point).

3. **Range Validation:**
   - Since `i` starts at `n - k` and the loop continues as long as `i <= n + 1`, we need to ensure that `n - k` is valid and within the bounds such that the loop can execute.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `q`, and `p` do not directly affect the loop execution based on the provided information.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, `n - k` must be a valid starting point for the loop. This means `n - k` should be less than or equal to `n + 1`.

State: **`i` is `n - k`, `n - k` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is `n - k`, `n - k` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`**
