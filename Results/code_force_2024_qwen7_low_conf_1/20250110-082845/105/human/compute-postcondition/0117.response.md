The code `print(p)` simply prints the value of `p`. Since no other operations are performed on the variables after this line, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `q` is a list such that `q[0] = 0` and for each `j` from 1 to `n`, `q[j] = q[j-1] + a[j-1]`, `l` is 0 if `n - k - x < 1` and `l` is `n - k - x` otherwise, `p` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` for `i` in the range `[n - k, n]`, `p` is printed.**
