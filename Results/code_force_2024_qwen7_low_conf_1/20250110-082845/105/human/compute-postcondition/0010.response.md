Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the same
- `k` is the same
- `x` is the same
- `y` is the next value from the sorted output of `R()`
- `a` is `[0, y, 2*y]`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for y in sorted(R()):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `y`**: The variable `y` is taken from the sorted output of the function `R()`. Since it's stated that `y` is the "next value from the sorted output of `R()`," this means `y` is already set to the next value from `R()` at the end of the previous iteration.
2. **Variable `a`**: The list `a` is defined as `[0, y, 2*y]`. Since `y` has been updated to the next value from `R()`, `a` will automatically update to `[0, next_y, 2*next_y]` in the next iteration.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `t` is still `t - 1` (unchanged)
- `n` remains the same (unchanged)
- `k` remains the same (unchanged)
- `x` remains the same (unchanged)
- `y` is now the next value from the sorted output of `R()` (updated)
- `a` is now `[0, y, 2*y]` (updated based on the new `y`)

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the same, `k` is the same, `x` is the same, `y` is the next value from the sorted output of `R()`, `a` is `[0, y, 2*y]`**
