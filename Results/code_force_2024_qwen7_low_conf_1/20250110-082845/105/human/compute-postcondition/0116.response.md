Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes.

### Initial State:
- \( i \) is \( n \)
- \( n \) is a non-negative integer
- \( k \) is greater than or equal to 0
- \( q \) is a list such that \( q[0] = 0 \) and for each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), \( q[j] = q[j-1] + a[j-1] \)
- \( x \) is an integer
- \( p \) is a variable initialized to some value (initially unknown)

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
    if i - x < 1:
        l = 0
    else:
        l = i - x
    m = 2 * q[l] - q[i]
    if m > p:
        p = m
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**: Initially, \( i = n \).
2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop starts with \( i = n - k \) and increments \( i \) up to \( n \).
   - For each iteration, \( l \) is set to 0 if \( i - x < 1 \), otherwise \( l \) is set to \( i - x \).
   - \( m \) is calculated as \( 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \).
   - If \( m > p \), then \( p \) is updated to \( m \).

### Final State:
- **Value of \( i \)**: After the loop finishes, \( i \) will be \( n + 1 \) because the loop condition is \( i < n + 1 \) and the last value of \( i \) that satisfies this condition is \( n \). Therefore, the loop increments \( i \) one more time to \( n + 1 \).
- **Value of \( p \)**: The value of \( p \) will be the maximum value of \( m \) encountered during the loop. Since \( m \) is updated only when \( m > p \), \( p \) will hold the maximum value of \( m \) seen during the loop iterations.
- **Value of \( l \)**: The value of \( l \) depends on the condition \( i - x < 1 \). After the loop, the last value of \( l \) will be either 0 or \( n - k - x \) (if \( n - k - x \geq 1 \)).
- **Values of \( q \)**: The list \( q \) remains unchanged throughout the loop as the loop does not modify \( q \).

### Output State:
- \( i \) is \( n + 1 \)
- \( n \) is a non-negative integer
- \( k \) is a non-negative integer
- \( q \) is a list such that \( q[0] = 0 \) and for each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), \( q[j] = q[j-1] + a[j-1] \)
- \( l \) is 0 if \( n - k - x < 1 \) and \( l \) is \( n - k - x \) otherwise
- \( p \) is the maximum value of \( m \) where \( m = 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \) for \( i \) in the range \( [n - k, n] \)

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `q` is a list such that `q[0] = 0` and for each `j` from 1 to `n`, `q[j] = q[j-1] + a[j-1]`, `l` is 0 if `n - k - x < 1` and `l` is `n - k - x` otherwise, `p` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` for `i` in the range `[n - k, n]`.**
