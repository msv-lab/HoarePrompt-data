Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q[j] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[j]` for `j = 0` to `n-1`, `p` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` where `l` is 0 if `n - k - x < 1` and `l` is `n - k - x` otherwise, `p` is printed.**

Explanation:
- After the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains as the initial input because it is only used to determine the number of test cases and does not change within the loop.
- `i` will be `n + 1` if the loop did not run for all `t` test cases or `n` if it completed all iterations.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` will retain their final values after reading from the input.
- `a` will be the list of integers sorted in ascending order after reading and sorting.
- `q[j] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[j]` for `j = 0` to `n-1`, which means `q` will be a prefix sum array of `a`.
- `p` will be the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` where `l` is determined based on the condition `i - x < 1`.

Since the loop iterates over each test case, `p` will store the maximum value obtained from the expression `2 * q[l] - q[i]` for all iterations, which is printed at the end.
