Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be a non-negative integer; `q` is a list such that `q[0] = 0` and for each `j` from 1 to `n`, `q[j] = q[j-1] + a[j-1]`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Execution:**
   - Initially, `i` is set to `n + 1`.
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations.
   - In each iteration, the value of `i` is decremented by 1 (though it is not explicitly modified in the loop body, the loop condition checks `i < n`).

2. **Appending to `q`:**
   - The loop appends `q[-1] + a[i]` to `q` in each iteration.
   - Since `i` starts from `n + 1` and the loop runs `n` times, `i` will decrement to `n` by the end of the loop.
   - After the loop, `i` will be `n`.

3. **Value of `q`:**
   - The initial value of `q` is `[0]`.
   - In the first iteration (`i = n`), `q` becomes `[0, a[n-1]]`.
   - In the second iteration (`i = n-1`), `q` becomes `[0, a[n-1], a[n-1] + a[n-2]]`.
   - This process continues until the `n`-th iteration, where `q` becomes `[0, a[n-1], a[n-1] + a[n-2], ..., a[n-1] + a[n-2] + ... + a[0]]`.

4. **Final Values:**
   - After the loop, `i` will be `n`.
   - The list `q` will contain `n+1` elements, starting from `0` and each subsequent element being the cumulative sum of the first `j` elements of `a` (where `j` ranges from `0` to `n`).

5. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute at least `n` times, `n` must be a non-negative integer.

Thus, the final output state is as described above.
