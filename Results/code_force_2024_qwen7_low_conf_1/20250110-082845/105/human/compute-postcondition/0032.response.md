Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is `t_initial - 1`
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`
   - `a` is `[0, y]`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for y in sorted(R()):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the sorted values returned by the function `R()`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over the sorted values returned by `R()`, each iteration will pick the next value from the sorted list.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was the value taken from `R()` and added to the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to take the next value from `R()` and sort it.

5. **Variables to Adjust:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` are also unchanged as they are not modified inside the loop.
   - `a` will now include the next value from `R()`, which means `a` becomes `[0, y, next_y]` where `next_y` is the next value from `R()`.

6. **Next Value from `R()`:**
   - Since we don't know the exact value returned by `R()`, we denote it as `next_y`.

7. **Final State:**
   - `t` is still `t_initial - 1`
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same values returned by `R()`
   - `a` now includes the next value from `R()`, so `a` is `[0, y, next_y]`

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is `t_initial - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0, y, next_y]***
