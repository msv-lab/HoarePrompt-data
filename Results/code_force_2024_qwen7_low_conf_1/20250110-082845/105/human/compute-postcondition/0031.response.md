`a` is initially `[0]`. The code `a += a[-1] + y` updates `a` by appending `a[-1] + y` to the list. However, the value of `y` is not defined in the given code snippet. Since `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`, let's assume `y` is one of these values or a combination of them. 

Since `a[-1]` is `0`, the new value added to `a` will be `0 + y`, which simplifies to `y`. Therefore, `a` will become `[0, y]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t_initial - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0, y]`**
