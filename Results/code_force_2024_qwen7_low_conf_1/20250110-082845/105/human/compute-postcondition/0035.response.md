The code snippet `a += a[-1] + y` modifies the list `a`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is `t_initial - 1`
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`
- `a` is `[0, next_y, next_y + y, y]`

Let's break down the steps:

1. `a` is initially `[0, next_y, next_y + y, y]`.
2. `a[-1]` refers to the last element of `a`, which is `y`.
3. `a[-1] + y` means `y + y`, which is `2y`.
4. `a += a[-1] + y` is equivalent to `a = a + (a[-1] + y)`, which means `a = [0, next_y, next_y + y, y] + 2y`.
5. This results in `a` becoming `[0, next_y, next_y + y, y, 2y]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t_initial - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0, next_y, next_y + y, y, 2y]`**
