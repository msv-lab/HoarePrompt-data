Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list such that `q[0] = 0` and for each `j` from 1 to `n`, `q[j] = q[j-1] + a[j-1]`, `l` is either 0 or `i - x` depending on whether `(n - 1) - x < 1`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n - 1]`, and `m` is greater than `p`.***
