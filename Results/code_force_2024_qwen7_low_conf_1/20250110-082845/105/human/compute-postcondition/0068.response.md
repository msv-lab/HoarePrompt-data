`p` is assigned the value of `m`. This means that `p` now holds the same value as `m`, which was previously updated to `2 * q[l] - q[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n - k + 1`; `l` is either 0 or `i - x` depending on whether `i - x < 1`; `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`; `p` is equal to `m`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`; `l` is either 0 or `i - x` depending on whether `i - x < 1`; `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`; `p` is equal to `m`**
