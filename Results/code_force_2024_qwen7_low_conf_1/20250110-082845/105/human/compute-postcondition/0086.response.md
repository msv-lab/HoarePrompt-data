The code `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])` tries to append a new element to the list `q`. However, the loop condition `i < n` is not satisfied because `i` is set to `n + 1`, which means the loop will not execute, and thus this line of code will not be run. Therefore, the list `q` will not be modified.

Output State: **no changes in variables**
