`t` is a positive value greater than `i`. The code `t -= 1` decreases the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was originally a positive value greater than `i`, after subtracting 1, `t` will still be a positive value but now it is `t - 1`, which is still greater than `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive value equal to `t - 1`, which is still greater than `i`**
