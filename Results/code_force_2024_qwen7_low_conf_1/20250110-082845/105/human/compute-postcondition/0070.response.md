Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `i` is `n - k + 1`
   - `l` is either 0 or `i - x` depending on whether `i - x < 1`
   - `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`
   - `p` is updated to `m` if `m > p`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n + 1`, inclusive. Therefore, the loop will run while `i <= n`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - k + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at `n - k + 1` and increases by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n - k + 2`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - **`i`**: It will increase by 1, so `i` becomes `n - k + 2`.
   - **`l`**: The value of `l` depends on the condition `i - x < 1`. Since `i` changes to `n - k + 2`, we need to check if this new value of `i` satisfies the condition for `l`. However, without knowing the exact value of `x`, we cannot definitively say how `l` will change. We only know that `l` was either 0 or `i - x` before.
   - **`m`**: This value is derived from `2 * q[l] - q[i]`. With the new `i`, the value of `m` will be recalculated as `2 * q[l] - q[n - k + 2]`.
   - **`p`**: `p` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the new `m` if `m > p`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The key variables that need adjustment are `i`, `l`, `m`, and `p`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `i` and the potential recalculations for `l`, `m`, and `p`.

**State:**
- `i` is `n - k + 2`
- `l` is either 0 or `n - k + 2 - x` depending on whether `n - k + 2 - x < 1`
- `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n - k + 2]`
- `p` is updated to `m` if `m > p`

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `n - k + 2`, `l` is either 0 or `n - k + 2 - x` depending on whether `n - k + 2 - x < 1`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n - k + 2]`, and `p` is updated to `m` if `m > p`**.
