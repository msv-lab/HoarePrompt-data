The code `p = -10 ** 5` assigns the value `-100000` to the variable `p`. The other variables (`i`, `l`, `m`, `a`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

- `i` is initially `n + 1`.
- `l` is either `0` or `n - k - x` depending on whether `n - x < 1`.
- `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n]`.
- `p` is now `-100000`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.
- `q` is `[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `l` is either `0` or `n - k - x` depending on whether `n - x < 1`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n]`, `p` is `-100000`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `q` is `[0]`**
