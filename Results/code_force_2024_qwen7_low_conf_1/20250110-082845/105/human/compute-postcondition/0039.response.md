The function `func` accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function processes three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, and an array `a` of length `n` with elements 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

After processing each test case, the function does not explicitly return a value, but rather performs operations based on the input parameters. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, the function could return different outcomes depending on the specific logic implemented within the function body. Since no specific return value is mentioned in the problem statement, we focus solely on the parameters accepted.
