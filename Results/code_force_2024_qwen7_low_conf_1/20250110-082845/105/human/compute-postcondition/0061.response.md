`p` is assigned the value of `m`. From the initial state, we know that `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]` and `m` is greater than `p`. Since `p` is now set to `m`, `p` becomes `2 * q[l] - q[i]` and remains greater than `p` (which is now itself). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n - k`, `l` is either 0 or `n - k - x` depending on whether `i - x < 1`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`, and `p` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`**
