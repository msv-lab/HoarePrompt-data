The initial state is defined as `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are the values returned by `R()`. The code snippet assigns the list `[0]` to the variable `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `x`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are the values returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0]`**
