Postcondition: **`i` is `n - k`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list such that `q[0] = 0` and for each `j` from 1 to `n`, `q[j] = q[j-1] + a[j-1]`, `l` is either `0` or `n - k - x` depending on whether `(n - 1) - x < 1`, and `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`. If `m > p`, then the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged since there is no else part.**
