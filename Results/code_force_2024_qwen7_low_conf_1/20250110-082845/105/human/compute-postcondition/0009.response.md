`a` is updated by adding the value of `a[-1] + y` to the list. Here, `a[-1]` is the last element in the list `[0, y]`, which is `y`. Therefore, `a` becomes `[0, y, y + y] = [0, y, 2*y]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the same, `k` is the same, `x` is the same, `y` is the next value from the sorted output of `R()`, `a` is `[0, y, 2*y]`**
