The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. This changes the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, but does not affect the initial values of `i`, `l`, and `m`. The precondition that `i` is `n + 1` and `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n]` remains valid, but the exact value of `m` now depends on the new value of `n`. The value of `l` also remains dependent on the condition `n - x < 1`.

Since the actual values of `q` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `m`. However, we know that `p` is the maximum value of `m` encountered during the loop, which hasn't been initialized or updated in this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `l` is either `0` or `n - k - x` depending on whether `n - x < 1`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n]`, `p` is the maximum value of `m` encountered during the loop (unchanged)**
