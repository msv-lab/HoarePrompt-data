The code `print(p)` simply prints the value of `p`. Since `p` is the maximum value of `m` encountered during the loop, and no loop or iteration is performed in this code snippet, the value of `p` remains unchanged. The output of the print statement will be the value of `p` from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `l` is either `0` or `n - k - x` depending on whether `n - x < 1`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n]`, `p` is the maximum value of `m` encountered during the loop, and the output of the print statement is `p`.**
