To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- The initial state before the loop:
  - `i` is `n + 1`
  - `l` is either `0` or `n - k - x` depending on whether `n - x < 1`
  - `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n]`
  - `p` is `-100000`
  - `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user
  - `q` is `[0]`

- The for loop statement:
  ```python
  for i in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will run as long as `i < n`.
   - Given `i` is initially `n + 1`, this means `i` is already greater than `n`, so the loop will not execute at all.

2. **Variable `l`:**
   - The value of `l` is either `0` or `n - k - x` depending on whether `n - x < 1`.
   - This does not directly affect the loop execution since the loop condition involves `i`.

3. **Variable `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated based on `q[l]` and `q[n]`.
   - This does not directly affect the loop execution since the loop condition involves `i`.

4. **Variable `p`:**
   - `p` is `-100000`, which is a constant value and does not affect the loop execution.

5. **Variable `a`:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers, but its value does not directly affect the loop execution.

6. **Variable `q`:**
   - `q` is initialized as `[0]`, which means it has one element (index 0).

### Conclusion:
Since the loop condition `i < n` is not satisfied because `i` is `n + 1`, the loop will not execute at all regardless of the values of other variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary to ensure the loop executes because the loop will not run under the given initial conditions.

### Final Answer:
State: **No changes needed; the loop will not execute because `i` is `n + 1` and the loop condition requires `i < n`.**
