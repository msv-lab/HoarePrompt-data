The initial state is given as follows:
- `t` is `t_initial - 1`
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`
- `a` is `[0, y, next_y]`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
a += a[-1] + y,
```

This line of code updates the list `a`. Let's break it down:

1. `a[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `a`, which is `next_y`.
2. The expression `a[-1] + y` evaluates to `next_y + y`.
3. The `+=` operator appends the result of `next_y + y` to the list `a`.

So, the updated list `a` will be `[0, y, next_y, next_y + y]`.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state remains:
- `t` is `t_initial - 1`
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`
- `a` is now `[0, y, next_y, next_y + y]`

Output State: **`t` is `t_initial - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0, y, next_y, next_y + y]`**
