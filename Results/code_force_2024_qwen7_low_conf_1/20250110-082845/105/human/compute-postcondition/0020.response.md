Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `R()` returns a non-empty list.
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned values from `R()`.
   - `a` is updated such that each element is incremented by the sum of the previous element and `y`, where `y` is one of the elements returned by `R()`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for y in sorted(R()):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the list returned by `sorted(R())`.
   - Each iteration takes an element `y` from the sorted list and performs some operation (not specified but assumed to involve updating `a`).

4. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sorted(R())` must return a non-empty list, meaning `R()` must return a non-empty list.
   - Since `y` is taken from the sorted list, we need to ensure there is at least one more element in the list for the next iteration.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - `R()` must still return a non-empty list because the loop relies on it to generate `y`.
   - The value of `y` used in the current iteration is one of the elements from the sorted list. For the next iteration, `y` will be the next element in the sorted list.

Given the above points, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- `R()` should still return a non-empty list.
- The list from `R()` is sorted, and the current iteration uses one element from this list. Therefore, for the next iteration, the list must have at least one more element.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`R()` returns a non-empty list, `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned values from `R()`, `a` is updated such that each element is incremented by the sum of the previous element and `y`, where `y` is one of the elements returned by `R()`, and the sorted list from `R()` must have at least one more element for the next iteration.**

However, to keep the answer concise and focused on the key elements that change:

State: **`R()` returns a non-empty list, `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned values from `R()`, and the sorted list from `R()` must have at least one more element for the next iteration.**
