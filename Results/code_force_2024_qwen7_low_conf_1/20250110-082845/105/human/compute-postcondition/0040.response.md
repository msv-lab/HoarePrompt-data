Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts four inputs: the number of elements `n`, an integer `k`, an integer `x`, and an array `a` of length `n`. It then computes and prints the maximum value of the expression `2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i]` for `i` in the range `n - k` to `n + 1`. The function handles up to `2 * 10^5` elements across all test cases. If `x` is greater than `n`, `max(i, x)` simplifies to `x`. If `k` is larger than `n`, the range `n - k` to `n + 1` becomes invalid, but the function still computes the expression for valid indices within this range.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `x > n`, the expression `max(i, x)` will always simplify to `x`, so the computation will only depend on `a[x]`.
- If `k > n`, the range `n - k` to `n + 1` might become invalid (i.e., `n - k < 0`), but the function still attempts to compute the expression for valid indices. If `n - k < 0`, the computation will start from `i = 0` to `i = n + 1`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where `k` is negative or where `x` is zero. While these cases do not violate the problem constraints, they might produce unexpected results if not explicitly handled. However, since the constraints ensure `1 ≤ x, k ≤ n`, these cases are not directly addressed in the code.
