The code sets `l` to `i - x`. The previous value of `i` was `n - k`, so the new value of `l` is `n - k - x`. The values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `m`, `p`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `n - k`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list such that `q[0] = 0` and for each `j` from 1 to `n`, `q[j] = q[j-1] + a[j-1]`, `l` is `n - k - x`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n - 1]`, and `m` is equal to `p` if `m > p`. Otherwise, `m` remains unchanged.**
