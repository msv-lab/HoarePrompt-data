Let's break down the given Python code step by step:

1. The initial state is as follows:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - k`, and `-k < 0`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input and sorted in ascending order.
   - `q` is `[0]`.
   - `p` is `-10`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   q.append(q[-1] + a[i])
   ```

3. Let's analyze the impact:
   - `q` is a list that starts with `[0]`.
   - `q[-1]` refers to the last element of `q`, which is `0`.
   - `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

4. After executing `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])`, the new value of `q` will be `[0, 0 + a[i]]` or simply `[0, a[i]]`.

5. Since `i` is `n - k` and `-k < 0`, `i` is less than `n`. This means `i` is a valid index for the list `a`.

6. The updated value of `q` is `[0, a[i]]`.

7. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - k`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input and sorted in ascending order.
- `q` is `[0, a[i]]`.
- `p` is `-10`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n - k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input and sorted in ascending order, `q` is `[0, a[i]]`, `p` is `-10`.**
