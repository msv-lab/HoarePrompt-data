According to the provided code snippet, the loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `i` is `i + 1`, which suggests a self-increment operation (though it is redundant).
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- `q` is updated by appending `q[-1] + a[i]` to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
2. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
3. Since `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new `i` will be `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.
4. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

Given these steps, the updated states are:

- `i` is now `i + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

The state of `q` is updated by appending `q[-1] + a[i]` to it, but since the question asks for the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**
