`l` is assigned the value `i - x`. The value of `i` is `n`, and `x` can be any value. Therefore, the value of `l` is `n - x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be a non-negative integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list such that `q[0] = 0` and for each `j` from 1 to `n`, `q[j] = q[j-1] + a[j-1]`, `x` can be any value, `l` is `n - x`**
