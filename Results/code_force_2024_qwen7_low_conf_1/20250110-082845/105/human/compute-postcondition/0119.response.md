The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\), and a list of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Case_1: The function returns an error message if any of the constraints for `n`, `k`, `x`, or the values in the list `a` are violated.
Case_2: If all constraints are satisfied, the function processes the test cases and returns a result based on the specific logic implemented within the function body.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `t` and for each of the `t` test cases, accept additional parameters `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list of integers `a`. It checks if the input values meet the specified constraints, and if so, processes the data according to some unspecified logic, returning the appropriate result. If any constraint is violated, it returns an error message.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts `n`, `k`, `x` as positive integers and a list of `n` integers `a`. If all constraints are met, it processes the test cases and returns a result based on the logic within the function. If any constraint is violated, it returns an error message.**
