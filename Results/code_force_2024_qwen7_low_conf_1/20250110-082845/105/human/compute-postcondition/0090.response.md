The initial state provides that `i` is `i + 2` and `n` must be greater than `i + 2`. However, the actual value of `i` before this increment is not specified. Let's denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`.

The given code snippet is:
```python
q.append(q[-1] + a[i])
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of `i` is updated to `i_initial + 2`.
2. `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])` appends to the list `q` the value of the last element in `q` plus the value of `a[i]`, where `i` is now `i_initial + 2`.

Since the initial value of `i` is not explicitly stated, we'll keep it as `i_initial` and use `i_initial + 2` for `i`.

Therefore, the output state after the code execution is:
- `i` is now `i_initial + 2`.
- `q` has had its last element updated by adding `a[i_initial + 2]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_initial + 2`; `q` has had its last element updated by adding `a[i_initial + 2]`.**
