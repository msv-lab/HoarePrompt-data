Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: 
   - `t` is `t - i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` are the values returned by `R()` in the last iteration.
   - `y` is the next value from the sorted output of `R()` in the last iteration.
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sum of `y` up to the current iteration.
   - The print statement outputs the maximum value of the expression `2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i]` for each `i` in the range from `n - k` to `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop continues as long as `t` is non-zero.

3. **Determining the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must be non-zero at the end of the current iteration.
   - Given that `t` is `t - i` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `t - i > 0` to proceed to the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `t` must be greater than `i` at the end of the current iteration.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `t` is non-zero at the end of the current iteration.
   - Since `t` is updated by subtracting `i`, we need to make sure that `t` is initially set to a value such that `t - i` remains positive.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself. Specifically, `t` must be a value such that when `i` (the value from the previous iteration) is subtracted, the result is still non-zero.

**State**:
**`t` must be a positive value greater than `i`**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`t` must be a positive value greater than `i`**
