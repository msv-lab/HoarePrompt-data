State at the end of the previous iteration: no changes in variables means that the values of `i` and `n` remain the same as they were before the loop started.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's analyze the loop:

1. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.
2. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
3. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since there were no changes in the variables `i` and `n` during the previous iteration, we assume the initial values of `i` and `n` were set before the loop started. Let's denote these initial values as follows:
- Initial value of `i` = `i_initial`
- Initial value of `n` = `n_initial`

At the start of the first iteration:
- `i` = `i_initial`
- `n` = `n_initial`

After `k` iterations (where `k` is the number of iterations completed), the value of `i` would be:
- `i` = `i_initial + k`

For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`. After `k` iterations, the condition for the loop to continue is:
- `i_initial + k < n_initial`

If the loop completes all iterations up to `n-1`, then `i` would be `n-1` at the end of the loop.

To determine the state for the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

Given that no changes occurred in the variables during the previous iteration, the only thing that needs to change is the value of `i` to `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

Hence, the state is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
