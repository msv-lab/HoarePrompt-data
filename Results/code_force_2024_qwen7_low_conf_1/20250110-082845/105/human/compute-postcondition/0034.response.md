Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is `t_initial - 1`
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`
   - `a` is `[0, y, next_y, next_y + y]`

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for y in sorted(R()):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the sorted values returned by the function `R()`.
   - The variable `y` takes on each value from the sorted result of `R()` in each iteration.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was the last value taken from `sorted(R())`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to get the next value from `sorted(R())`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `y` is being updated with the next value from `sorted(R())`, the new value of `y` will be the next element in the sorted sequence.
   - The variable `a` will be updated to reflect the new `y` value, so `a` becomes `[0, next_y, next_y + y, y]` where `next_y` is the value before `y` in the sorted sequence.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop's progression.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` remains `t_initial - 1`
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` are still the values returned by `R()` (they don't change with the loop).
   - `a` is updated to `[0, next_y, next_y + y, y]` where `next_y` is the value of `y` from the previous iteration.
   - `y` is the next value from `sorted(R())`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is `t_initial - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are values returned by `R()`, `a` is `[0, next_y, next_y + y, y]`**
