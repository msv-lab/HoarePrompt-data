Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; the function `R` is defined as a lambda function that takes input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string to an integer; for each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` are positive integers and an array `a` of length `n` where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000` for all elements `a_i` in the array; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2⋅10^5`.**
