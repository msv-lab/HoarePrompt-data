The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts four inputs: the number of elements `n`, an integer `k`, an integer `x`, and an array `a` of length `n`. It then computes and prints the maximum value of the expression `2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i]` for `i` in the range `n - k` to `n + 1`. The function handles up to `2 * 10^5` elements across all test cases. If `x` is greater than `n`, `max(i, x)` simplifies to `x`. If `k` is larger than `n`, the range `n - k` to `n + 1` becomes invalid, but the function still computes the expression for valid indices within this range.
