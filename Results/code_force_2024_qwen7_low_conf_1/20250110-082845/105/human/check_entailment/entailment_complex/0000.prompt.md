You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n; and an array a of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all elements a_i in the array. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k, x = R()
        
        a = [0]
        
        for y in sorted(R()):
            a += a[-1] + y,
        
        print(max(2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i] for i in range(n - k, n + 1)))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are the values returned by `R()` in the last iteration, `a` is a list where `a[0] = 0` and for every index `i` from 1 to `m`, `a[i] = a[i-1] + y_i`, and the maximum value of `2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i]` for `i` in the range `n - k` to `n + 1` has been computed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts four inputs: the number of elements `n`, an integer `k`, an integer `x`, and an array `a` of length `n`. It then computes and prints the maximum value of the expression `2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i]` for `i` in the range `n - k` to `n + 1`. The function handles up to `2 * 10^5` elements across all test cases. If `x` is greater than `n`, `max(i, x)` simplifies to `x`. If `k` is larger than `n`, the range `n - k` to `n + 1` becomes invalid, but the function still computes the expression for valid indices within this range.
