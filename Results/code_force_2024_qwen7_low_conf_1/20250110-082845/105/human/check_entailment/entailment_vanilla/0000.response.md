Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to analyze how Alice and Bob's actions affect the sum of the array.

1. **Alice's Action**: Alice can remove up to `k` elements from the array. To maximize the sum, she should remove the smallest elements.
2. **Bob's Action**: Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by -1. To minimize the sum, he should flip the sign of the largest elements remaining after Alice's removal.

The key is to find out which elements are best removed by Alice and which are best flipped by Bob to achieve their respective goals.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array to easily identify the smallest elements.
2. **Consider Removals and Flips**:
   - If Alice removes elements, those removed contribute negatively to the sum.
   - Bob then flips some of the remaining elements, further affecting the sum.

The given program uses a lambda function to read input and processes each test case. It sorts the array and computes the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob make their optimal moves.

Let's analyze the logic within the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and individual test cases' parameters.
2. **Sorting the Array**: It sorts the array, ensuring that the smallest elements come first.
3. **Dynamic Programming Array Construction**: The array `a` is constructed where `a[i]` represents the prefix sum up to index `i`.
4. **Maximizing the Sum**: It calculates the maximum sum by considering different scenarios of Alice removing elements and Bob flipping elements.

The program aims to find the optimal strategy for both players. Here is the detailed breakdown of the inner loop logic:

- **Loop through Remaining Elements**: For each potential segment of the array that Alice doesn't remove, calculate the sum if Bob flips the elements in that segment.
- **Compute Maximum Sum**: Use dynamic programming to compute the maximum possible sum considering the constraints.

Given the problem statement and the code logic, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for both players playing optimally.

Correctness: **True**
