You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to analyze how Alice and Bob's actions affect the sum of the array.

1. **Alice's Action**: Alice can remove up to `k` elements from the array. To maximize the sum, she should remove the smallest elements.
2. **Bob's Action**: Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by -1. To minimize the sum, he should flip the sign of the largest elements remaining after Alice's removal.

The key is to find out which elements are best removed by Alice and which are best flipped by Bob to achieve their respective goals.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array to easily identify the smallest elements.
2. **Consider Removals and Flips**:
   - If Alice removes elements, those removed contribute negatively to the sum.
   - Bob then flips some of the remaining elements, further affecting the sum.

The given program uses a lambda function to read input and processes each test case. It sorts the array and computes the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob make their optimal moves.

Let's analyze the logic within the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and individual test cases' parameters.
2. **Sorting the Array**: It sorts the array, ensuring that the smallest elements come first.
3. **Dynamic Programming Array Construction**: The array `a` is constructed where `a[i]` represents the prefix sum up to index `i`.
4. **Maximizing the Sum**: It calculates the maximum sum by considering different scenarios of Alice removing elements and Bob flipping elements.

The program aims to find the optimal strategy for both players. Here is the detailed breakdown of the inner loop logic:

- **Loop through Remaining Elements**: For each potential segment of the array that Alice doesn't remove, calculate the sum if Bob flips the elements in that segment.
- **Compute Maximum Sum**: Use dynamic programming to compute the maximum possible sum considering the constraints.

Given the problem statement and the code logic, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for both players playing optimally.
