### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze its behavior step-by-step according to the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, passing the necessary parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s` to the function `func_1`.
   - This part of the program is correct and handles the input processing correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sequence Initialization**:
     - Initializes `sequence` with the value `x` and sets `current_sum` to `x`.
   - **Loop Through Sequence Length**:
     - Iterates `n-1` times to build the sequence.
     - In each iteration, it checks if adding `y` to the last element of the sequence would keep the current sum within the bounds of `s`.
       - If true, it appends `sequence[-1] + y` to the sequence and updates `current_sum`.
       - If false, it appends `sequence[-1] % y` to the sequence and updates `current_sum`.
     - If at any point the current sum exceeds `s`, it immediately returns `None`, indicating that no valid sequence exists for this case.
   - **Check Final Sum**:
     - After building the sequence to the desired length, it checks if the current sum equals `s`.
       - If true, it returns the sequence.
       - If false, it returns `None`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - If `func_1` returns a sequence, the program prints "Yes" followed by the sequence.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, the program prints "No".

#### Key Points to Validate:

1. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **Zero `y`**: The function correctly handles the case where `y` is zero by only appending `x % y` (which is `x`) and the sum will never increase.
   - **Zero `s`**: The function correctly returns `None` unless `x` is zero.
   - **Length `n` is One**: The function correctly returns `[x]` if `x` is less than or equal to `s` and `x` is not zero; otherwise, it returns `None`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The function correctly ensures that the current sum does not exceed `s` at any point during the construction of the sequence.

3. **Final Sum Check**:
   - The function correctly checks if the final sum equals `s` and returns the appropriate sequence or `None`.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. It checks for the possibility of constructing a sequence that meets the criteria and outputs the appropriate result based on whether such a sequence exists.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
