Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic**: The `func_1` function correctly attempts to construct a modular sequence that sums up to `s` by either adding `y` or taking the modulo `y` of the last element in the sequence. This logic aligns with the problem description.
   
2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - **Zero `y`**: The code handles this edge case implicitly because adding `y` would result in the same number if `y` is zero. This is not problematic since the function correctly returns `None` in such scenarios.
   - **Zero `s`**: The function correctly returns `None` if `s` is zero and `x` is not zero.
   - **Single Element (`n=1`)**: The function correctly handles this case by returning `[x]` if `x` is less than or equal to `s` and `x` is not zero.

3. **Sum Check**: The function ensures that the sum of the sequence does not exceed `s` at any point. If it does, the function immediately returns `None`.

4. **Final Sequence Validation**: After constructing the sequence, the function checks if the sum of the sequence equals `s`. If it does, the sequence is returned; otherwise, `None` is returned.

5. **Output Logic**: The main loop in the program correctly prints "Yes" followed by the sequence if `func_1` returns a non-`None` value. Otherwise, it prints "No".

Given that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for constructing the sequence and the main program correctly handles the outputs based on the function's return values, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
