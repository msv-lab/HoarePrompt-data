Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes the sequence with the first element `x`.
   - Iteratively builds the sequence while ensuring the sum of the sequence does not exceed `s`.
   - Appends `sequence[-1] + y` if it keeps the sum within `s`, otherwise appends `sequence[-1] % y`.
   - Checks if the sum of the sequence equals `s` after `n` iterations.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handles the case where `y` is zero by always appending `x % y` (which is `x`), preventing an infinite loop.
   - Ensures `s` is reachable by constructing the sequence step-by-step.
   - Returns `None` if the sum exceeds `s` or if it's impossible to reach `s` within `n` steps.
4. **Output Handling**: The program correctly prints "Yes" followed by the sequence if the sum equals `s`, and "No" if the sequence is `None`.

The provided implementation correctly handles the problem constraints and edge cases. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
