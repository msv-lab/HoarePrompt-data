### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step according to the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Step 1: Initialization
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
- Inside each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`.
- It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

#### Step 2: Function `func_1`
- **Initialization**: The function initializes the sequence with the first element `x` and sets the initial sum to `x`.
- **Loop through sequence length**: The function iteratively builds the sequence up to length `n`:
  - If adding `y` to the last element of the sequence would keep the current sum within the bounds of `s` and the difference `(s - current_sum - y)` is divisible by `y`, it appends `sequence[-1] + y` to the sequence.
  - Otherwise, it appends `sequence[-1] % y` to the sequence.
  - It updates the current sum accordingly.
  - If at any point the current sum exceeds `s`, it immediately returns `None`.
- **Check final sum**: After building the sequence to the desired length, it checks if the current sum equals `s`. If so, it returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

#### Evaluation of the Logic
1. **Initial Values**: The sequence starts with `x` and the sum is initialized to `x`.
2. **Sequence Building**:
   - The condition `if current_sum + y <= s and (s - current_sum - y) % y == 0:` ensures that the next element in the sequence is chosen such that the sum remains within bounds and the difference `(s - current_sum - y)` is divisible by `y`.
   - This means that the next element in the sequence is either `sequence[-1] + y` or `sequence[-1] % y`.
   - The loop continues until the sequence reaches length `n` or the sum exceeds `s`.
3. **Final Check**: After the loop, if the sum of the sequence equals `s`, the function returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

#### Testing the Logic with Examples
1. **Example 1**: `n = 5`, `x = 8`, `y = 3`, `s = 28`
   - Sequence: `[8, 11, 2, 5, 2]`
   - Explanation: 
     - `8 + 3 = 11`
     - `11 % 3 = 2`
     - `2 + 3 = 5`
     - `5 % 3 = 2`
   - Sum: `8 + 11 + 2 + 5 + 2 = 28`
   - The sequence satisfies the condition.

2. **Example 2**: `n = 3`, `x = 5`, `y = 3`, `s = 6`
   - Sequence: `[5]` (not possible since `5 % 3 = 2` and adding `y` results in `5 + 3 = 8`, which exceeds `s`).
   - Explanation: 
     - `5 % 3 = 2`
     - Adding `y` (3) results in `8`, which exceeds `s`.
   - The sequence does not satisfy the condition.

3. **Example 3**: `n = 9`, `x = 1`, `y = 5`, `s = 79`
   - Sequence: `[1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1]`
   - Explanation: 
     - Starting with `1`, the sequence alternates between `1` and `6` (since `1 + 5 = 6` and `6 % 5 = 1`).
     - Sum: `1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 31`
   - The sequence does not satisfy the condition.

#### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to build a sequence that meets the specified conditions. It handles both cases where a valid sequence exists and where it does not. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct.

#### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the examples provided.
