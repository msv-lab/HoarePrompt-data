Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze its behavior step-by-step according to the problem description.

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes by reading the number of test cases `t`. It then iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1` with the necessary parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sequence Initialization**: It starts with a sequence containing only the initial value `x`.
   - **Loop Through Sequence Length**: It then iteratively builds the sequence up to length `n`.
     - If adding `y` to the last element of the sequence would still keep the current sum within the bounds of `s`, it appends the new value (`sequence[-1] + y`) to the sequence.
     - Otherwise, it appends the last element modulo `y`.
     - It updates the current sum accordingly.
     - If at any point the current sum exceeds `s`, it immediately returns `None`, indicating that no valid sequence exists for this case.
   - **Check Final Sum**: After building the sequence to the desired length, it checks if the current sum equals `s`. If so, it returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - If `func_1` returns a sequence, the program prints "Yes" followed by the sequence.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, the program prints "No".

Given the logic and flow of the program, it correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. The program checks for the possibility of constructing a sequence that meets the criteria and outputs the appropriate result based on whether such a sequence exists.

Correctness: **True**
