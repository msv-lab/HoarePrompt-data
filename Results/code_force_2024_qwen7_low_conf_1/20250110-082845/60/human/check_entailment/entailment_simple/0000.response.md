Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes the sequence with the first element `x`.
   - Iterates through the sequence generation process, ensuring that each subsequent element is either `a_i-1 + y` or `a_i-1 % y` based on the current sum and remaining required sum `s`.
   - Ensures that the generated sequence adheres to the constraints and that the final sum matches `s` exactly.

3. **Sequence Generation Logic**:
   - The loop constructs the sequence while maintaining the conditions:
     - `a_i = a_{i-1} + y` if adding `y` keeps the sum within bounds and the remaining sum `(s - current_sum - y)` is divisible by `y`.
     - Otherwise, `a_i = a_{i-1} % y` to ensure the sequence continues while staying within the constraints.
   - If at any point the current sum exceeds `s`, the function returns `None`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if the total sum of the sequence equals `s`. If so, it returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

5. **Output Handling**:
   - If a valid sequence is found, it prints "Yes" followed by the sequence.
   - If no valid sequence is found, it prints "No".

The program handles all the edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem statement. It correctly generates a modular sequence or determines that no such sequence exists, based on the input parameters. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and the correctness is **True**.
