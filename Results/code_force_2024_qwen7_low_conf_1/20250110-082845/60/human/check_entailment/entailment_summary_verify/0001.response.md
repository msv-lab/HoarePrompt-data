Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and function `func_1` based on the problem description and the given function summary.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case, passing the necessary parameters to `func_1`.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sequence Initialization**: It starts with a sequence containing only the initial value `x`.
   - **Loop Through Sequence Length**: It then iteratively builds the sequence up to length `n`.
     - The logic for appending `sequence[-1] + y` or `sequence[-1] % y` to the sequence is implemented correctly.
     - The condition to ensure the sum does not exceed `s` is checked properly.
     - If the sum exceeds `s` at any point, the function correctly returns `None`.
   - **Check Final Sum**: After building the sequence to the desired length, it checks if the current sum equals `s`. If so, it returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

The main concern is whether the function `func_1` correctly handles all edge cases and boundary conditions. Let's consider some critical edge cases:

- **Edge Case 1: \( y = 0 \)**:
  - If `y` is zero, the function will always append `x % y` (which is `x`) and the sum will never increase, potentially leading to an infinite loop unless `x` is zero. However, since the problem constraints state \( 1 \leq y \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), `y` cannot be zero. Therefore, this edge case is not relevant here.

- **Edge Case 2: \( s = 0 \)**:
  - If `s` is zero, the function will only return `None` unless `x` is also zero. This is correctly handled because if `x` is zero, the sequence will remain `[0]`, and the sum will be zero, which matches the requirement. If `x` is non-zero, the sequence will not be able to achieve a sum of zero.

- **Edge Case 3: \( n = 1 \)**:
  - If `n` is one, the function will return `[x]` if `x` is less than or equal to `s` and `x` is not zero; otherwise, it will return `None`. This is correctly handled.

- **General Case**:
  - The function iteratively builds the sequence and ensures that the sum does not exceed `s`. If the sum equals `s` after `n` steps, it returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the implementation aligns with the logic described in the function summary. The program correctly outputs "Yes" followed by the sequence if it exists, and "No" if it does not.

Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
