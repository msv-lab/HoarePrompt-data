You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given two integers x and y . A sequence a of length n is called
modular if a_1=x , and for all 1 < i \le n the value of a_{i} is either
a_{i-1} + y or a_{i-1} \bmod y . Here x \bmod y denotes the remainder from
dividing x by y .

Determine if there exists a modular sequence of length n with the sum of its
elements equal to S , and if it exists, find any such sequence.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers n , x , y ,
and s (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le y \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le s \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the sequence, the
parameters x and y , and the required sum of the sequence elements.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 , and also the
sum of s over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, if the desired sequence exists, output "Yes" on the first
line (without quotes). Then, on the second line, output n integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_n separated by a space — the elements of the sequence a . If there
are multiple suitable sequences, output any of them.

If the sequence does not exist, output "No" on a single line.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5 8 3 28
    
    3 5 3 6
    
    9 1 5 79

Output

    YES
    8 11 2 2 5 
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the sequence [8, 11, 2, 5, 2] satisfies the conditions.
Thus, a_1 = 8 = x , a_2 = 11 = a_1 + 3 , a_3 = 2 = a_2 \bmod 3 , a_4 = 5 = a_3
+ 3 , a_5 = 2 = a_4 \bmod 3 .

In the second example, the first element of the sequence should be equal to 5
, so the sequence [2, 2, 2] is not suitable.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(n, x, y, s):
```
