Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1. If `current_sum + y` is less than or equal to `s` and `(s - current_sum - y)` modulo `y` equals 0, then `sequence` includes `current_sum + y`. Otherwise, `current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + sequence[-1]`, `y` has the same value, `s` has the same value, and `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`.***
