To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the conditions under which the loop operates.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `s` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `sequence` is a list containing one element `[x]`, and `current_sum` is `x`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, the loop checks two conditions:
     - `current_sum + y <= s` and \((s - current_sum - y) \% y == 0\).
     - If the condition is true, `sequence.append(sequence[-1] + y)` and `current_sum += y`.
     - If the condition is false, `sequence.append(sequence[-1] \% y)` and `current_sum += sequence[-1]`.
   - The loop also checks if `current_sum > s` and returns `None` if it does.

### Loop Execution Analysis

- **Condition True**: 
  - If `current_sum + y <= s` and \((s - current_sum - y) \% y == 0\), the sequence is extended by appending `sequence[-1] + y`, and `current_sum` is incremented by `y`.
- **Condition False**:
  - If the above condition is false, the sequence is extended by appending `sequence[-1] \% y`, and `current_sum` is incremented by the last element of `sequence` (which is `sequence[-1]`).

### Final State After All Iterations

Given that the loop continues until `i` reaches `n-1`, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. **Case 1: The loop executes `n-1` times**:
   - The loop will always append elements to `sequence` based on the condition.
   - The final value of `current_sum` will be the sum of all appended values according to the condition logic.
   - The final value of `sequence` will be a list of length `n`, starting with `[x]` and then following the pattern based on the condition.

2. **Case 2: The loop does not execute**:
   - If `n == 1`, the loop does not run, and the sequence remains `[x]` with `current_sum` being `x`.

### Output State Calculation

Considering the loop runs `n-1` times, the final state can be summarized as follows:

- `n` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `x` retains its original value.
- `y` retains its original value.
- `s` retains its original value.
- `sequence` will be a list of length `n` where the first element is `x` and the rest of the elements follow the logic described.
- `current_sum` will be the sum of the sequence according to the loop logic.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `s` retains its original value, `sequence` is a list of length `n` starting with `[x]` and then follows the pattern based on the condition logic, and `current_sum` is the sum of the sequence according to the loop logic.**
