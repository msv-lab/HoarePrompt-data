`current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + y`, and the value of `y` is added to `current_sum`. The value of `y` remains the same, and the value of `s` remains the same. The `sequence` is updated with the last element followed by the last element plus `y`, and `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, the impact of the code is to add `y` to `current_sum`.

Output State: **`current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + y`, `y` has the same value, `s` has the same value, `sequence` is updated with the last element followed by the last element plus `y`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2.**
