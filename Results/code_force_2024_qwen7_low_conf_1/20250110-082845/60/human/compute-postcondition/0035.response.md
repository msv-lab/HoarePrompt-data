Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`. It constructs a sequence starting with `x` and follows a specific pattern based on the given condition logic. The function checks if the sum of the sequence can reach exactly `s` within `n` steps. If the sum equals `s` after `n` steps, it returns the constructed sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

The function iterates `n-1` times, each time appending either `sequence[-1] + y` or `sequence[-1] % y` to the sequence, depending on whether adding `y` keeps the current sum within `s`. If at any point the sum exceeds `s`, the function immediately returns `None`.

After executing the loop, if the sum of the sequence equals `s`, the function returns the constructed sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `y` is zero, the function will always append `x % y` (which is `x`) and the sum will never increase, potentially leading to an infinite loop unless `x` is zero.
- If `s` is zero, the function will only return `None` unless `x` is also zero.
- If `n` is one, the function will return `[x]` if `x` is less than or equal to `s` and `x` is not zero; otherwise, it will return `None`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is:
- `n` remains unchanged and satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `x` remains unchanged and satisfies \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `y` remains unchanged and satisfies \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` remains unchanged and satisfies \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `sequence` is a list of length `n` starting with `[x]` and follows the specified pattern based on the given condition logic, or `None` if the sum exceeds `s` or cannot reach `s` within `n` steps.**

The function effectively determines if a sequence starting with `x` and incrementing by `y` (or cycling through the last element modulo `y`) can reach exactly `s` within `n` steps, returning the sequence if possible or `None` otherwise.
