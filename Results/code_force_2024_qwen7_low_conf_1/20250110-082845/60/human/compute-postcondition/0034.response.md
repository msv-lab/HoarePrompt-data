The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

The function returns a list named `sequence` starting with `[x]` and following a specific pattern based on the given condition logic.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`, and return a list `sequence` starting with `[x]` following a specified pattern.
