The code assigns the value of `x` to `current_sum`. The initial values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `s`, and `sequence` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the only change is that `current_sum` now holds the value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= 2 * 10^5, `y` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= y <= 2 * 10^5, `s` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= s <= 2 * 10^5, `sequence` is a list containing one element `[x]`, and `current_sum` is `x`.**
