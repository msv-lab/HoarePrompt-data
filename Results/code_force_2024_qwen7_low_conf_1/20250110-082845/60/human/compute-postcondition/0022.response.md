The code appends the value of the last element in `sequence` plus `y` to the `sequence` list. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since its initial value is not specified, only the change in `sequence` is relevant.

Therefore, the updated `sequence` list will include the new element, which is the sum of the last element of the previous `sequence` list and `y`.

Output State: **`current_sum` retains its value, `y` retains its value, `s` retains its value, `sequence` is updated to include `sequence[-1] + y`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` retains its value**
