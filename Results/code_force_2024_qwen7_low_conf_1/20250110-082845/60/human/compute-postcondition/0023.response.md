The code `current_sum += y` updates the value of `current_sum` by adding the value of `y` to it. The previous values of `current_sum` and `y` are retained, and the other variables (`s`, `sequence`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`current_sum` is its previous value plus `y`, `y` retains its value, `s` retains its value, `sequence` is updated to include `sequence[-1] + y`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` retains its value**
