`current_sum` is incremented by the value of `sequence[-1]`, which is the last element of the `sequence` list modulo `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `current_sum` is now `current_sum + sequence[-1]`
- `n` must still be greater than 1
- `y` remains the same
- `s` remains the same
- `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`

Since `sequence` is updated but we don't know the exact values of its elements, we only need to note the update to `current_sum`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `current_sum` is `current_sum + sequence[-1]`; `y` has the same value; `s` has the same value; `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`.**
