Postcondition: ***`current_sum`, `y`, `s`, `sequence`, `i`, and `n` retain their values as per the precondition. If `current_sum + y <= s` and `(s - current_sum - y) % y == 0`, then `current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + y`, and `sequence` is updated with the last element followed by the last element plus `y`. Otherwise, `current_sum` is updated to the previous value of `current_sum` plus the last element of `sequence`, and `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`.***
