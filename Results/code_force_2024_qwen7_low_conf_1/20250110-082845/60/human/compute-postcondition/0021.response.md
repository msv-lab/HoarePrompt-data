Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify Initial Conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `current_sum` retains its value from the previous iteration.
   - `y`, `s`, `sequence`, `i`, and `n` retain their values from the previous iteration.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Update Logic Inside the Loop**:
   - If `current_sum` is not greater than `s` and the condition `(s - current_sum - y) % y == 0` holds, then:
     - `current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + y`.
     - `sequence` is updated to include the last element followed by the last element plus `y`.
   - Otherwise, `current_sum` is updated to the previous value of `current_sum` plus the last element of `sequence`, and `sequence` is updated to include the last element appended by its value modulo `y`.

4. **Determine Next Iteration State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The conditions for updating `current_sum` and `sequence` depend on the outcome of the loop body, but since we don't have the specific details of the loop body execution, we assume the general logic described above.

Given this analysis, the states to adjust for the next iteration are:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Thus, the new state is:

**State: **`current_sum` retains its value, `y` retains its value, `s` retains its value, `sequence` retains its value, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` retains its value**.
