`sequence.append(sequence[-1] % y)` appends the remainder of `sequence[-1]` divided by `y` to the list `sequence`. However, the initial values of `sequence`, `current_sum`, `y`, and `s` are not provided, and the conditions `current_sum + y > s` or `(s - current_sum - y) % y != 0` do not affect the direct modification of `sequence`.

Since `sequence[-1]` refers to the last element in the `sequence` list, appending `sequence[-1] % y` updates the list but does not change the values of `current_sum`, `y`, or `s`. The conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `current_sum` has the same value, `y` has the same value, `s` has the same value, and either `current_sum + y > s` or `(s - current_sum - y) % y != 0`; `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`.**
