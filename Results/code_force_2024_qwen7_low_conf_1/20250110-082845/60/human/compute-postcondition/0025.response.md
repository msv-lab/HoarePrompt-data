`current_sum` is incremented by the last element of the `sequence`, which is `sequence[-1] % y`. The value of `sequence[-1] % y` is updated after the previous operation, but since we don't know the exact values of `sequence`, `y`, and `current_sum`, we'll keep them in their symbolic form.

- `current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + sequence[-1] % y`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The other variables (`y`, `s`, `sequence`, and `n`) retain their original values.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`current_sum` is `current_sum + sequence[-1] % y`, `i` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its value, `s` retains its value, `sequence` is updated with the new element `sequence[-1] % y`, and `n` retains its value.**
