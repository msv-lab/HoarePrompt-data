The code appends the value of `sequence[-1] % y` to the list `sequence`. The value of `sequence[-1]` is the last element in the list `sequence`, and it is taken modulo `y`. However, since the exact values of `sequence` and `y` are not specified, we will represent them symbolically.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and this is the only explicit change mentioned in the precondition.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`current_sum` retains its value, `y` retains its value, `s` retains its value, `sequence` is appended with `sequence[-1] % y`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` retains its value**
