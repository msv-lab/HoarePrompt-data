According to the code, the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + sequence[-1]`
- `y` has the same value
- `s` has the same value
- `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be one more than it was in the previous iteration. Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, if `i` was previously some value `k`, then in the next iteration `i` will be `k+1`.

Given that `i` was incremented from `k` to `k+1`, and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be `2` (assuming it was `1` in the previous iteration) and `n` must still be greater than `2`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `current_sum` remains the same
- `y` remains the same
- `s` remains the same
- `sequence` remains the same

State: **`current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + sequence[-1]`, `y` has the same value, `s` has the same value, `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
