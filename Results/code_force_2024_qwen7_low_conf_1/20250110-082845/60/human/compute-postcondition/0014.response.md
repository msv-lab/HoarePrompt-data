The code `sequence.append(sequence[-1] + y)` appends the value of the last element in `sequence` plus `y` to the end of the list `sequence`. Given the initial state where `current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + sequence[-1]`, `y` has the same value, `s` has the same value, `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2, the impact on the variables is:

- `sequence` will have its last element updated and a new element appended which is the last element plus `y`.
- No changes to `current_sum`, `y`, `s`, `i`, or `n`.

Output State: **`current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + sequence[-1]`, `y` has the same value, `s` has the same value, `sequence` is updated with the last element followed by the last element plus `y`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
