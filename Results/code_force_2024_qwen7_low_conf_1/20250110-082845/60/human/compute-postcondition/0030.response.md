Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `s` retains its original value, `sequence` is a list of length `n` starting with `[x]` and then follows the pattern based on the condition logic, `current_sum` is the sum of the sequence according to the loop logic, and the current value of `current_sum` is equal to `s`***
