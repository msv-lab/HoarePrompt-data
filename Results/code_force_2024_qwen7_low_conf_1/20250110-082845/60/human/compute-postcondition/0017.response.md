The code updates `current_sum` by adding the last element of the `sequence` to it. The last element of `sequence` is appended with its value modulo `y`. The values of `y`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Since `current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + sequence[-1]`, the new value of `current_sum` will be the previous value of `current_sum` plus the last element of `sequence`.

Output State: **`current_sum` is the previous value of `current_sum` plus the last element of `sequence`, `y` has the same value, `s` has the same value, `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
