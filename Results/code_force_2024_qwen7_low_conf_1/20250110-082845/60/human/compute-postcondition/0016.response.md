The code appends the last element of the `sequence` list modulo `y` to the `sequence` list. Since `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`, the length of `sequence` increases by 1, and the last element of `sequence` is now the value of the second last element modulo `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + sequence[-1]`
- `y` has the same value
- `s` has the same value
- `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

After executing the line `sequence.append(sequence[-1] % y)`, the value of `sequence` changes by appending the last element modulo `y`. However, the exact value of `sequence` cannot be specified without knowing the initial values of `sequence` and `y`. But we know that the last element of `sequence` is now the value of the second last element modulo `y`.

Output State: **`current_sum` is updated to `current_sum + sequence[-1]`, `y` has the same value, `s` has the same value, `sequence` is updated with the last element appended by its value modulo `y`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
