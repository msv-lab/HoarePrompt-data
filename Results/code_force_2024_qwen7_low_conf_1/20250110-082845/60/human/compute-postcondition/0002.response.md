Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `s` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `sequence` is a list containing one element `[x]`.
   - `current_sum` is `x`.

2. **For Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`, meaning the loop will execute if and only if `1 <= i < n`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts at `i = 1` and ends just before `i = n`).

4. **Modifying States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n > 1`.
   - Since the loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, the initial value of `i` should be `1` (which is already given as part of the loop structure).

Given this analysis, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop starts are:

- Ensure that `n` is greater than 1 so that the loop can execute at least once.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `s`, `sequence`, and `current_sum` do not directly affect the loop execution condition, so they do not need to be modified.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
