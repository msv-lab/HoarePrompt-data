The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` (an integer representing the number of prison cells) and `edges` (a list of tuples representing bidirectional corridors between cells). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the provided edges. Then, it performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from each unvisited node to determine the connected components of the graph. Finally, it returns a list containing the results of these BFS operations, where each result is a list representing the nodes in the corresponding connected component. The `visited` list is updated to mark all nodes as visited after processing.
