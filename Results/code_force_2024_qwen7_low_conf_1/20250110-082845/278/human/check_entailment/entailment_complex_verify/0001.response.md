### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - The goal is to minimize the total funding required, which includes the costs of forming the complexes and building the connecting corridor.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - `func_1(n, edges)` is intended to find connected components in the graph. It uses BFS to explore the graph starting from each unvisited node and collects all nodes in each component.
   - `bfs(start)` is a helper function that performs BFS to find all nodes in a component starting from a given node.
   - `func_2(n, m, c, edges)` aims to find the minimum cost to divide the graph into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.

3. **Verification of `func_1` and `bfs`:**
   - These functions correctly implement BFS to find connected components. They traverse the graph and mark visited nodes, ensuring each node is visited only once.
   - However, the `visited` list is initialized as `[False] * (n + 1)`, which means it includes an extra element for `0`. This is unnecessary and could potentially cause issues if not handled properly. Since the graph indices start from `1`, this should be `[False] * n`.

4. **Verification of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` checks if there is only one component. If true, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to divide the graph into two parts with one connecting corridor.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through all pairs of components and calculates the cost for each pair. The cost for each pair is the sum of the squares of the sizes of the components plus the cost `c` for the connecting corridor.
   - The minimum cost among all pairs is returned.
   - **Issue:** The code assumes that the graph is always connected, which is not necessarily true. The `if (len(components) == 1)` condition should be `if (len(components) <= 1)`. If there are no components (i.e., `len(components) == 0`), the program should also return `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where the graph is fully connected (one component), returning `-1` in such cases.
   - However, it does not handle the case where the graph is disconnected and has zero components. In such cases, the program should return `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the functions implement BFS to find connected components and calculate the minimum cost. However, there are a couple of issues:
1. The `visited` list should be initialized as `[False] * n`.
2. The `if (len(components) == 1)` condition should be `if (len(components) <= 1)` to handle the case where there are no components.

Given these issues, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
