### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - The goal is to minimize the total funding required, which includes the costs of forming the complexes and building the connecting corridor.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - `func_1(n, edges)` is intended to find connected components in the graph. It uses BFS to explore the graph starting from each unvisited node and collects all nodes in each component.
   - `bfs(start)` is a helper function that performs BFS to find all nodes in a component starting from a given node.
   - `func_2(n, m, c, edges)` aims to find the minimum cost to divide the graph into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.

3. **Verification of `func_1` and `bfs`:**
   - These functions correctly implement BFS to find connected components. They traverse the graph and mark visited nodes, ensuring each node is visited only once.
   - However, there is a potential issue with how `visited` is being used. In `func_1`, `visited` is reset to `[False] * (n + 1)` before calling `bfs`. This ensures that `bfs` starts from the next unvisited node. However, in `bfs`, `visited` should be passed by reference to ensure that it retains the state across recursive calls. Currently, `visited` is reinitialized inside `bfs`, which means that `bfs` starts fresh for each component, leading to incorrect marking of nodes.

4. **Verification of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` checks if there is only one component. If true, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to divide the graph into two parts with one connecting corridor.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through all pairs of components and calculates the cost for each pair. The cost for each pair is the sum of the squares of the sizes of the components plus the cost `c` for the connecting corridor.
   - However, due to the issue with `visited` in `bfs`, the components found by `func_1` might be incorrect, leading to wrong calculations of component sizes and thus incorrect minimum cost calculations.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where the graph is fully connected (one component), returning `-1` in such cases.
   - However, the handling of the edge case where the graph is fully connected is correct, but the core logic for finding and calculating the minimum cost is flawed due to the incorrect component identification.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the provided code would work correctly due to a subtle issue with how the `visited` array is handled in the `bfs` function. The code does not correctly identify connected components, leading to incorrect calculations of the minimum cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
