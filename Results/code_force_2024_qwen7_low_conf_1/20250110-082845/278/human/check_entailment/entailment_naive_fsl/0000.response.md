Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the `func_1` function is intended to find all connected components in the graph. However, the implementation of `bfs` within `func_1` uses a global variable `visited`, which is not properly initialized before each call to `bfs`. This leads to incorrect results because the `visited` list is shared across different calls to `bfs`.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following input:

```
t = 1
n = 4
m = 6
c = 5
edges = [(4, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1)]
```

The expected output is `20`, but due to the shared `visited` list, the program might incorrectly merge some components, leading to incorrect funding calculations.

Here's an example of how the program might fail:

- If the first call to `bfs` starts from node 1, it might mark nodes 1, 2, and 4 as visited.
- If the second call to `bfs` starts from node 3, it might not visit nodes 2 and 4 because they are already marked as visited.

This would lead to incorrect component sizes and hence incorrect funding calculations. To fix this, `visited` should be passed as a parameter to `bfs` or reset within `func_1` before each call to `bfs`.
