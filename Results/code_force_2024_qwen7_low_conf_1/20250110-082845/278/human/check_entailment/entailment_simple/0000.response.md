Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Components and Connection Cost Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` and `bfs` are correctly implemented to find the connected components of the graph. However, the function `func_2` is responsible for determining the minimum funding required to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - In `func_2`, the function attempts to calculate the minimum cost by iterating through all pairs of components and calculating the cost as \( \text{len(components[i])}^2 + \text{len(components[j])}^2 + c \). However, this approach does not account for the fact that the cost should include the additional corridor costs to connect the two complexes.

2. **Missing Logic for Finding the Minimum Cost with Additional Corridors:**
   - The problem requires that the two complexes are connected by exactly one corridor. The current implementation does not handle the logic to find the minimum cost by considering all possible ways to add one additional corridor between the two complexes.
   - The provided implementation does not ensure that the additional corridor is added in a way that minimizes the total funding. It simply calculates the cost without considering the optimal placement of the additional corridor.

3. **Incomplete Logic for Handling All Test Cases:**
   - While the code handles the basic logic of finding connected components, it does not handle the full complexity of the problem. Specifically, it does not consider all possible ways to connect two components with a single corridor to minimize the total funding.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Find all connected components.
- Determine the optimal way to connect two components with exactly one additional corridor.
- Calculate the total funding including the cost of the additional corridor.

Here is a more detailed explanation of how the solution should work:

1. **Find Connected Components:**
   - Use `func_1` to find all connected components.

2. **Calculate the Minimum Funding:**
   - For each pair of components, calculate the cost of connecting them with a single additional corridor.
   - Ensure that the cost calculation includes the cost of the additional corridor.
   - Track the minimum total funding across all possible connections.

By addressing these points, the program would correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
