Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the provided edges.
   - It then performs a BFS from each unvisited node to determine the connected components of the graph.
   - Finally, it returns a list of connected components.

2. **Function `bfs` Analysis**:
   - This function performs a BFS starting from a given node to find all nodes in the connected component.
   - It updates the `visited` dictionary to mark nodes as visited and appends them to the `component` list.
   - The function correctly identifies and returns all nodes in the connected component.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function uses the output of `func_1` to determine the number of connected components.
   - If there is only one connected component, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to divide the prison into two distinct complexes.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through all pairs of connected components, calculates the cost for connecting them, and finds the minimum cost.

4. **Program Flow**:
   - The main program reads input, calls `func_2` for each test case, and prints the result.
   - `func_2` correctly handles the problem constraints and logic to find the minimum cost to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies whether the graph can be divided into two distinct complexes.
   - It correctly calculates the minimum cost to connect two complexes, ensuring the conditions of the problem are met.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
