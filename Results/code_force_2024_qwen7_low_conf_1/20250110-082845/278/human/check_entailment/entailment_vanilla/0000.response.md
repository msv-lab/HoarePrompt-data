Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - The goal is to minimize the total funding required, which includes the costs of forming the complexes and building the connecting corridor.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - `func_1(n, edges)` is intended to find connected components in the graph. It uses BFS to explore the graph starting from each unvisited node and collects all nodes in each component.
   - `bfs(start)` is a helper function that performs BFS to find all nodes in a component starting from a given node.
   - `func_2(n, m, c, edges)` aims to find the minimum cost to divide the graph into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.

3. **Verification of `func_1` and `bfs`:**
   - These functions correctly implement BFS to find connected components. They traverse the graph and mark visited nodes, ensuring each node is visited only once.

4. **Verification of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` checks if there is only one component. If true, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to divide the graph into two parts with one connecting corridor.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through all pairs of components and calculates the cost for each pair. The cost for each pair is the sum of the squares of the sizes of the components plus the cost `c` for the connecting corridor.
   - The minimum cost among all pairs is returned.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where the graph is fully connected (one component), returning `-1` in such cases.
   - It correctly identifies all components and calculates the minimum cost for dividing the graph into two parts with one connecting corridor.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
