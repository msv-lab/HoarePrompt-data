Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function constructs an adjacency list from the given edges and performs BFS to find all connected components in the graph.
   - The BFS function (`bfs`) correctly marks nodes as visited and collects all nodes in a component.
   - The `func_1` function returns a list of components, each represented as a list of nodes.

2. **Function `bfs` Analysis**:
   - This function performs a BFS starting from a given node and collects all nodes in the connected component.
   - It correctly uses a queue implemented with a `deque` and marks nodes as visited.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function uses the output from `func_1` to determine the number of connected components.
   - If there is only one component, it returns -1, which is correct because we need at least two components to satisfy the requirement.
   - It then iterates through all pairs of components to find the minimum cost to create a single connection between them, ensuring the sum of the squares of the sizes of the two components is minimized.
   - The cost calculation is correct as it considers the square of the size of each component and adds the cost `c` for building a single corridor.

Given the execution summaries, the functions collectively meet the problem requirements. They correctly identify connected components, handle the edge case where there is only one component, and calculate the minimum cost to connect two components.

Correctness: **True**
