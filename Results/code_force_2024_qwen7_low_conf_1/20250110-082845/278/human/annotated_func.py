#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of prison cells, edges is a list of tuples representing bidirectional corridors between cells where each tuple (u, v) indicates a corridor from cell u to cell v, and each cell u and v are integers such that 1 <= u, v <= n and u != v.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the bidirectional corridors between cells, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) where for each key `v` in `graph`, the list includes all `u` values from the tuples in `edges`.

    #`The program returns a list containing the results of bfs(i) for each i from 1 to n where visited[i] was False initially, with visited being a list of length n + 1 where all elements are True, and i is n + 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` (an integer representing the number of prison cells) and `edges` (a list of tuples representing bidirectional corridors between cells). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the provided edges. Then, it performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from each unvisited node to determine the connected components of the graph. Finally, it returns a list containing the results of these BFS operations, where each result is a list representing the nodes in the corresponding connected component. The `visited` list is updated to mark all nodes as visited after processing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing a cell index within the range [1, n], where n is the total number of prison cells.
def bfs(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    component = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()

            visited[node] = True
            component.append(node)

                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is an integer, `queue` is empty, `component` is a list containing all nodes in the connected component starting from `start`, `node` is `None`, `visited` is a dictionary where every node in the connected component has `True` for its value.
    return component
    #The program returns a list 'component' containing all nodes in the connected component starting from 'start', where every node in this list has True for its value in the 'visited' dictionary
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts an integer `start` representing a cell index within the range [1, n], where n is the total number of prison cells. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the given `start` node to find all nodes in the connected component. The function marks each visited node in a dictionary called `visited` with a value of `True`. After executing the function, it returns a list `component` containing all nodes in the connected component starting from `start`, where each node in this list has `True` for its value in the `visited` dictionary. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If the `start` node has no neighbors, the returned `component` list will only contain the `start` node itself.
- If the graph is completely disconnected (no nodes are reachable from `start`), the returned `component` list will only contain the `start` node.

Missing functionality in the annotations is that the function initializes the `visited` dictionary before starting the BFS, and it uses a `deque` from the `collections` module to implement the queue for BFS.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of prison cells, m is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors, c is an integer representing the funding required to build a corridor between any two cells, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u_i, v_i) represents a corridor between cells u_i and v_i.

            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is an integer such that `i + (len(components) - 1) < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `min_cost` is the minimum value among its original value and the sum of `cost_i = len(components[i])
    return min_cost
    #The program returns min_cost which is the minimum value among its original value and the sum of cost_i = len(components[i]) for each i where i + (len(components) - 1) < len(components)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`, where `n` represents the number of prison cells, `m` represents the number of bi-directional corridors, `c` represents the funding required to build a corridor between any two cells, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing corridors between cells. The function first determines the number of connected components in the graph using `func_1(n, edges)`. If there is only one connected component, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost required to connect all the connected components such that the sum of the squares of the sizes of each component is minimized, plus the cost `c` for building each corridor. The function returns the minimum cost found.
