`cost_j` is assigned the value of `len(components[j]) ** 2`. The value of `j` is `len(components) - 1`, so `len(components[j])` is the length of the last element in the `components` list. Therefore, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the last element in the `components` list. The values of `i`, `components`, and `cost_i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `j` is `len(components) - 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j]) ** 2`**
