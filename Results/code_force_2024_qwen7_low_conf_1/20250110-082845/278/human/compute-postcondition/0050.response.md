Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`, where `n` represents the number of prison cells, `m` represents the number of bi-directional corridors, `c` represents the funding required to build a corridor between any two cells, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing corridors between cells. The function first determines the number of connected components in the graph using `func_1(n, edges)`. If there is only one connected component, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost required to connect all the connected components such that the sum of the squares of the sizes of each component is minimized, plus the cost `c` for building each corridor. The function returns the minimum cost found.**

This summary includes the following key points:
- Accepts `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges` as parameters.
- Determines the number of connected components using `func_1`.
- Returns -1 if there is only one connected component.
- Calculates the minimum cost to connect all components, considering the sum of the squares of the sizes of each component and the cost `c` for building each corridor.
- Returns the minimum cost calculated.
