The code assigns the value of `len(components[j]) ** 2` to `cost_j`. The variable `j` will be updated to `k + 1` in the next iteration of the loop, and `cost_i` remains unchanged as it is the length of `components[i]` squared. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cost_j` and the unchanged state of `k + 1` for the next valid `j` value.

Output State: **the next valid `j` value will be `k + 1`, `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared, `cost_j` is the length of `components[j]` squared**
