`cost_i` is assigned the value of `len(components[i]) ** 2`. The value of `i` is such that `i + 2 < len(components)`, meaning `i` is an integer within a specific range relative to the length of `components`. The value of `min_cost` remains unchanged as no operation affecting it is performed in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 2 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `len(components[i])`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i]) ** 2`**
