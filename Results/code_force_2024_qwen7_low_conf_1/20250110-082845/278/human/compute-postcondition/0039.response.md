`cost_i` is assigned the value of the length of `components[i]` squared. The length of `components[i]` is calculated, then it is squared to assign the result to `cost_i`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: the next valid `j` value will be `k + 1`, ensuring that the loop continues to execute; `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared.
