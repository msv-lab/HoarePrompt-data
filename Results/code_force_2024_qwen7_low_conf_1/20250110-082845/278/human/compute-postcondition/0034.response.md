Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is an integer such that `i + 2 < len(components)`
   - `components` is a list with more than one element (`len(components) > 1`)
   - `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `len(components[i])`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `j` starting from `i + 1` up to but not including `len(components)`.

3. **Ensuring Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one value of `j` within the specified range.
   - This means `i + 1` should be less than `len(components)`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i + 2 < len(components)` is already given, we know that `i + 1` is less than `len(components)`, ensuring that the loop can start and run.
   - We don't need to adjust `min_cost` as it doesn't affect the loop condition directly.
   - We need to ensure `components` has enough elements to satisfy the loop's range, which is already guaranteed by the condition `len(components) > 1`.

Given this analysis, the state does not need any additional adjustments beyond what is already provided. 

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 2 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `len(components[i])`**
