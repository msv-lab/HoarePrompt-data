`min_cost` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`. The values of `i`, `components`, `j`, `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c` are not explicitly given, but the code impacts `min_cost` by updating it to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `j` must be within the range `[i + 1, len(components) - 1]`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`, `min_cost` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
