The code snippet updates the value of `cost_j` to be the square of the length of the `j`-th element in `components`. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, so `cost_j` will be updated to the square of the length of the second element in `components`.

Here are the steps:

1. Initially, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the `j`-th (second) element in `components`.
2. After executing the line `cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2`, `cost_j` is updated to the square of the length of the second element in `components`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`, `j` is 2, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the second element in `components`, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`**
