The code `cost_i = len(components[i]) ** 2` updates the value of `cost_i` to be the square of the length of the `i`-th element in the `components` list. The value of `i + 1 < len(components)` and the fact that `components` is a list with more than one element remain unchanged. The values of `j`, `cost_j`, and `min_cost` are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the updated value of `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`.

Output State: **`i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`, `j` is 2, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the `j`-th element in `components`, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`**
