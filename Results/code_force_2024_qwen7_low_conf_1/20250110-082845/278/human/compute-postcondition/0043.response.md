The code assigns the value of `len(components[i]) ** 2` to `cost_i`. This updates the value of `cost_i` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **the next valid `j` value will be `k + 2`, `cost_j` is the length of `components[k + 2]` squared, `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i]) ** 2`**
