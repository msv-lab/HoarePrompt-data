`min_cost` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value (`min_cost`) and the sum of `cost_i` (which is `len(components[i])`), `cost_j` (which is `len(components[j])`), and `c`. The values of `i`, `components`, `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 2 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `len(components[i])`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`, and `min_cost` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.**
