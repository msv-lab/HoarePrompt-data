According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop condition is `j in range(i + 1, len(components))`. This means the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(components)` and `j` starts from `i + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`
- `components` is a list with more than one element
- `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`
- `j` is 1
- `cost_j` is the square of the length of the `j`-th element in `components`
- `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`
- `cost_i` remains the same as before

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still satisfy the condition `j < len(components)`.

Given that `j` was initially 1, after one iteration, `j` becomes 2 (assuming `cost_j` is updated to the square of the length of the second element in `components`). For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `len(components)`.

So, we need to increment `j` to 2, and ensure that `j` is still within the bounds defined by the loop condition.

State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`, `j` is 2, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the `j`-th element in `components`, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`, `cost_i` remains the same as before**
