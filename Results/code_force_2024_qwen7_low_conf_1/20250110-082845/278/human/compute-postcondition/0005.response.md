According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range of `len(components)`. For the loop to execute, `components` must be a positive integer greater than 0 because the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = len(components) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a corridor between any two cells.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u_i, v_i) represents a corridor between cells u_i and v_i.
- `components` is the number of connected components in the graph formed by the prison cells and the corridors.
- `components` is greater than 1.
- `min_cost` is infinity.

For the loop to execute, `components` must be a positive integer and specifically greater than 1 as stated. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `components` is an integer greater than 0 and at least 2 (as given).

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `edges` is a list of tuples, `components` is an integer greater than 1, `min_cost` is infinity**
