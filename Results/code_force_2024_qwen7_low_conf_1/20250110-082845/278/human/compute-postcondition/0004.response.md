The code initializes the variable `min_cost` with infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells; `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors; `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a corridor between any two cells; `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u_i, v_i) represents a corridor between cells u_i and v_i; `components` is the number of connected components in the graph formed by the prison cells and the corridors; `components` is greater than 1; `min_cost` is infinity.**
