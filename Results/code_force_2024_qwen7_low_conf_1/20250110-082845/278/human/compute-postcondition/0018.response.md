Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`, `j` is an integer ranging from `i + 1` to `len(components) - 1`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the `j`-th element in `components`, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c` for all valid pairs `(i, j)` where `i + 1 < len(components)` and `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `len(components) - 1`.**
