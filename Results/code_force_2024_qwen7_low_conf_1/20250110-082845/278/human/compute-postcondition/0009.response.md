The code snippet `min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)` updates the value of `min_cost` by taking the minimum of its current value and the sum of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c`. The variables `i` and `j` are not directly affected by this line of code, and neither is the list `components`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`
- `components` is a list with more than one element
- `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`
- `j` is an integer
- `cost_j` is the square of the length of the `j`-th element in `components`

After executing the code, `min_cost` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`, `j` is an integer, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the `j`-th element in `components`, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.**
