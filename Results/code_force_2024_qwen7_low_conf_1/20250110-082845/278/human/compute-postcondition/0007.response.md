The code assigns the value of `len(components[i]) ** 2` to the variable `cost_i`. Since `components` is an integer (let's call it `N`), `components[i]` refers to the `i`-th element in the list, which is a string. The length of this string is squared and assigned to `cost_i`.

The initial state is:
- `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`
- `components` is an integer greater than 1 (which should be a list here)

After executing the code, the new state is:
- `cost_i` is assigned the value of `len(components[i]) ** 2`
- `i` remains unchanged
- `components` remains unchanged

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`; `components` is a list with more than one element; `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`.**
