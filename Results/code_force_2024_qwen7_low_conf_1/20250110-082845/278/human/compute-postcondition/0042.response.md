According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to the length of `components`. The loop can continue executing if `j` is within this range. At the end of the previous iteration, the next valid `j` value will be `k + 1`, `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared, `cost_j` is the length of `components[j]` squared, and `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be the next valid value after `k + 1`. Therefore, `j` should be `k + 2`. 

Since `j` is now `k + 2`, `cost_i` remains the same as it is based on `components[i]`, and `cost_j` will now be the length of `components[k + 2]` squared. The value of `min_cost` may or may not change depending on the new `cost_i + cost_j + c`, but we know it will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and the new `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

State: **the next valid `j` value will be `k + 2`, `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared, `cost_j` is the length of `components[k + 2]` squared, `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
