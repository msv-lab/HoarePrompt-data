Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is an integer such that `i + 2 < len(components)`
   - `components` is a list with more than one element
   - `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `len(components[i])`
   - `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`
   - `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`
   - `min_cost` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `len(components) - 1`.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range defined by the loop condition (`i + 1` to `len(components) - 1`).
   - `j` should be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, letâ€™s assume `j` was `k`. The next iteration will increment `j` by 1, so `j` will become `k + 1`.
   - Since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(components)`, `j` needs to be such that it is still within the valid range for the next iteration.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `i`.
   - `components` remains the same list.
   - `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c` at each iteration, but it does not change until the next iteration.
   - `cost_i` is `len(components[i])` and does not change during the loop.
   - `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`, and for the next iteration, it will be `len(components[j+1])`.

6. **Final State:**
   - The next valid `j` value will be `k + 1`, ensuring that the loop continues to execute.

Given these considerations, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 2 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `len(components[i])`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[k + 1])`, and `min_cost` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.**
