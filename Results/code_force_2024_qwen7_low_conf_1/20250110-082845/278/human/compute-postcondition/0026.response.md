The code sets `cost_j` to the square of the length of `components[j]`. Given the initial state, `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]`, and `cost_j` is now the square of the length of `components[j]`. The values of `i`, `components`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `j` must be within the range `[i + 1, len(components) - 1]`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `(len(components[j])) ** 2`**
