Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `len(components[i])**2`, `len(components[j])**2`, and `c` for all valid pairs `(i, j)` where `i + 1 < len(components)` and `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `len(components) - 1`.**
