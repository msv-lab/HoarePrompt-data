The code updates the value of `cost_i` to be the square of the length of `components[i]`. The previous value of `cost_i` was `len(components[i])`, and now it is squared. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `j` is `len(components) - 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i]) ** 2`, `cost_j` is `len(components[len(components) - 1])`, `min_cost` is updated to be the minimum of `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
