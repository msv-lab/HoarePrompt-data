The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a corridor between any two cells.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(u_i, v_i)` represents a corridor between cells `u_i` and `v_i`.

The function returns:

- **Case_1**: -1
- **Case_2**: `min_cost` which is the minimum value among its original value and the sum of `cost_i = len(components[i])` for each `i` where `i + (len(components) - 1) < len(components)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`, and return either -1 or the minimum cost based on certain conditions involving components.
