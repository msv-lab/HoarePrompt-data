Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Range**:
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 1, len(components))`.
   - This means the loop will start from `i + 1` and go up to but not including `len(components)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `j` will start from `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i + 1` must be less than `len(components)`.

3. **Check the Given Variables**:
   - `n` and `m` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they don't need adjustment.
   - `c` is also not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment either.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples and is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment.
   - `components` is an integer greater than 1, so we know `len(components)` is at least 2.
   - `min_cost` is infinity, which is not relevant to the loop condition.

4. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - Since `j` starts from `i + 1`, we need `i + 1` to be less than `len(components)`.
   - We also need `components` to be an integer greater than 1 (which is already given).

Therefore, the required adjustments are:
- `i` should be such that `i + 1 < len(components)`.
- `components` must be greater than 1 (already given).

Putting it all together, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:
State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is an integer greater than 1**
