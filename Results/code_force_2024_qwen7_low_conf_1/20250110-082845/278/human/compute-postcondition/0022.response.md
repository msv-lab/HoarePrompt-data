`cost_j` is assigned the value `len(components[j])**2`. The length of `components[j]` is squared, and this result is assigned to `cost_j`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `j` must be within the range `[i + 1, len(components) - 1]`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j])**2`**
