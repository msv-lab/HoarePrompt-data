`cost_i` is updated to the square of the length of `components[i]`. The original value of `cost_i` was `len(components[i])`, so now it is `len(components[i]) ** 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `j` must be within the range `[i + 1, len(components) - 1]`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i]) ** 2`, `cost_j` is `len(components[j + 1])`, `min_cost` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.
