Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 2 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `min_cost` is the minimum value among its original value, `cost_i = len(components[i]) ** 2`, and `cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2` for all `j` in the range `i + 1` to `len(components) - 1`, and `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c` for all `j` in the range `i + 1` to `len(components) - 1`.**
