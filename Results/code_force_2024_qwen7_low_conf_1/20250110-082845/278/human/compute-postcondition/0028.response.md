According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is within the specified range `[i + 1, len(components) - 1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`
- `components` is a list with more than one element
- `j` must be within the range `[i + 1, len(components) - 1]`
- `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`
- `cost_j` is `len(components[j])`
- `min_cost` is updated to be the minimum of `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `[i + 1, len(components) - 1]`. Since `j` is currently at its maximum value (one less than the length of the components list), the next value of `j` would be `len(components) - 1`.

Therefore, `j` should be set to `len(components) - 1`.

The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `j` is `len(components) - 1`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[len(components) - 1])`, `min_cost` is updated to be the minimum of `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
