`cost_i` is assigned the value of `len(components[i]) ** 2`. The length of `components[i]` is squared, and this value is stored in `cost_i`. The other variables (`i`, `components`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `j` must be within the range `[i + 1, len(components) - 1]`, `cost_i` is `len(components[i]) ** 2`**
