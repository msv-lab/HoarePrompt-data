The function `func_1(n, edges)` is called with parameters `n` and `edges`. The function's purpose is not specified, but it likely returns the number of connected components in the graph formed by the prison cells and the bi-directional corridors. The variables `n`, `m`, and `c` are not affected by this call, and the `edges` list remains unchanged. The output of `func_1` is stored in the variable `components`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `components`. However, we know that `components` will hold the number of connected components in the graph.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells; `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors; `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a corridor between any two cells; `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u_i, v_i) represents a corridor between cells u_i and v_i; `components` is the number of connected components in the graph formed by the prison cells and the corridors.**
