Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`.
   - `components` is a list with more than one element.
   - `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`.
   - `j` is an integer.
   - `cost_j` is the square of the length of the `j`-th element in `components`.
   - `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `len(components)`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `j + 1`.
   - The condition `j < len(components)` must still hold true.
   - The new `cost_j` will be the square of the length of the `(j+1)`-th element in `components`.

4. **New States:**
   - Since `j` starts from `i + 1` and we need to increment it for the next iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The new `cost_j` will be the square of the length of the `(j + 1)`-th element in `components`.

5. **Final State After One More Iteration:**
   - `i` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `components` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `cost_i` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `cost_j` is updated to the square of the length of the `(j + 1)`-th element in `components`.
   - `min_cost` may or may not change depending on the values of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c`.

Given these steps, the final state after one more iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`i` is an integer such that `i + 1 < len(components)`, `components` is a list with more than one element, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the `i`-th element in `components`, `j` is an integer and equals `j + 1`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the `(j + 1)`-th element in `components`, `min_cost` is the minimum of its original value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`**.
