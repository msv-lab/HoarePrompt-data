Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and the list `a` of distances.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes a list of positions with each house placed at `(i + 1, i + 1)` for simplicity, ensuring that no two houses share the same row initially. This is a reasonable starting point but may not guarantee a valid solution.
3. **Finding Visiting Houses**: For each wizard, it tries to find a house that is exactly `a[i]` away. However, the implementation of this step is flawed:
   - The program iterates over all positions to find a suitable house for each wizard, but it does not ensure that the chosen house for each wizard does not conflict with the previously assigned houses.
   - The positions are initialized such that all houses are in the same row, which violates the requirement that each house must be in a different row.
4. **Validation**: The validation logic does not correctly check for conflicts between the chosen positions for different wizards. If a wizard finds a house at a certain position, it does not check if this position is already taken by another wizard.
5. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" and the positions of all houses along with the indices of the houses to which each wizard visits during weekends. However, the initial positions being in the same row violate the problem constraints.

Given these points, the program does not correctly handle the constraints and fails to ensure that each house is in a different row. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not meet the problem requirements.

Final: **False**
