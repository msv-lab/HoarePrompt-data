Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and the list `a` of distances.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes a list of positions with each house placed at `(i + 1, i + 1)` for simplicity, ensuring that no two houses share the same row initially.
3. **Finding Visiting Houses**: For each wizard, it tries to find a house that is exactly `a[i]` away. It does this by iterating over all positions and checking the Manhattan distance. 
4. **Validation**: If a suitable house is found for a wizard, it records the index of that house in the `visit` array. If no suitable house is found, it prints "NO" and returns immediately.
5. **Output**: If all wizards have a suitable house, it prints "YES", followed by the positions of all houses and the indices of the houses to which each wizard visits during weekends.

**Evaluation**:
- The program ensures that each wizard has a unique row for their house, satisfying the condition that no two houses can be in the same row.
- The logic to check and assign visiting houses seems to cover all required conditions, including the distance requirement and the non-overlapping row condition.
- The program handles both cases (YES and NO) appropriately based on whether a valid configuration is found.

Given these points, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
