Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the distances specified by `a` do not allow for valid placements of houses. Specifically, the program always initializes the positions of houses to be at coordinates `(i + 1, i + 1)` for each wizard, which does not necessarily satisfy the requirement that each wizard should have a house exactly `a_i` away from their own house. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
4
0 4 2 4
```
In this case, the program initializes the positions as:
- Wizard 1: (1, 1)
- Wizard 2: (2, 2)
- Wizard 3: (3, 3)
- Wizard 4: (4, 4)

However, this initialization does not ensure that the distance condition is met for all wizards. For example, the distance from (1, 1) to (2, 2) is 2, not 0, and similarly, the distance from (1, 1) to (4, 4) is 6, not 4. Thus, the program fails to correctly place the houses according to the problem description.
