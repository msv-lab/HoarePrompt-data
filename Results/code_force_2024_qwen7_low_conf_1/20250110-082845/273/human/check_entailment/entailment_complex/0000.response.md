Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of houses `n` and the required distances `a` from the input.
   - It initializes the `positions` list with default values where each house is placed at `(i + 1, i + 1)`.

2. **Distance Verification Loop**:
   - The program iterates over each wizard's position to find another wizard's position that satisfies the distance requirement `a[i]`.
   - For each wizard, it checks all other wizards' positions to see if the Manhattan distance matches `a[i]`.
   - If a valid position is found, it sets `visit[i]` to the index of the visiting wizard `+1` and breaks out of the inner loop.
   - If no valid position is found for any wizard, the program immediately outputs "NO" and returns, indicating an invalid configuration.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - If the program completes the verification loop without returning, it outputs "YES" and proceeds to print the coordinates of the houses.
   - It then prints the `visit` list, which indicates the index of the house that each wizard visits during weekends.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where it cannot satisfy the distance requirement for all wizards, thus outputting "NO".
   - The program ensures that no two wizards are placed in the same column, satisfying the condition that each column contains at most one house.

Given the structure and logic of the provided code, it accurately implements the solution to the problem. It checks whether it is possible to place the houses such that the distance requirements and the view constraints are met, and it outputs the correct results accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
