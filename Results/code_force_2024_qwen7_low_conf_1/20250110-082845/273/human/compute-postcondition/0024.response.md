`visit[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`. The value of `j` is 1, so `visit[i]` is set to `1 + 1`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[i]` is 2**
