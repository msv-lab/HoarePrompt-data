According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know the following:

- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, split by spaces, and converted to integers.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `positions` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Since the problem specifies that `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, we can confirm that `n` will indeed be greater than 0.

Given this, we only need to ensure that `n` meets the condition to allow the loop to start executing. The other variables (`a` and `positions`) do not affect the loop's ability to start based on the given conditions.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
