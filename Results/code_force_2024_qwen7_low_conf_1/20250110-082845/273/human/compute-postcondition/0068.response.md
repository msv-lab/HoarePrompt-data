The code snippet `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `found` remain unchanged. The variable `visit` is not modified by this code either.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, and `found` is `False`. `visit[i]` contains the value of `j + 1` for the last successful iteration where the condition `dist == a[i]` was met, and all other `visit` entries that were updated during the loop are also set accordingly. The print statement outputs 'NO'.**
