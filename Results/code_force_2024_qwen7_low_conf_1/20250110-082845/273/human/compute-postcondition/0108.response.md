The code `print(pos[0], pos[1])` accesses the first and second elements of the tuple stored in the `pos` variable. Since the initial state does not specify what `pos` is initially, we assume `pos` is set to the second tuple in the `positions` list, which is `(1, 1)`. This assignment is done implicitly by the code snippet.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `1 1`. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. The only thing that happens is the printing of the values of `pos[0]` and `pos[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list of `n` tuples where the second tuple is (1, 1), `visit` is a list of length `n` where the first element is not -1, and the value of `pos` is (1, 1)**
