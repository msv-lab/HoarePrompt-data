Postcondition: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1]), `a[i]` is equal to `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, `found` is `True`.** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows the if part. If the condition `dist == a[i]` is true, then `i` and `j` are integers, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is calculated as the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a[i]` equals `dist`, `visit[i]` is set to `j + 1`, and `found` is set to `True`.
