According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n-1`. Since `i` starts from `n-1`, we need to decrease `i` by 1 to make it equal to `n-2`. Additionally, the conditions related to `j`, `found`, and `visit` remain the same because they are not directly affected by the loop's iteration.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition `i < n` must hold true for the loop to continue.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
3. To enter the next iteration, `i` needs to be `n-2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, `found` is `True`, and there exists an index `k` such that `visit[k]` is set to `j + 1`**.
