According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0` and `n` is greater than `0`.

Since `j` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `1`.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
