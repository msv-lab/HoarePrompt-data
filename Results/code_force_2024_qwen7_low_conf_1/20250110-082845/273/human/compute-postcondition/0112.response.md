Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` of size `n` and checks if it is possible to assign coordinates to `n` positions such that the Manhattan distance between each position `i` and another position `j` equals `a[i]` if `i` is not equal to `j`. If such an assignment is possible, it prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the positions and the indices of the positions that satisfy the distance conditions. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If no valid assignments can be made for the given distances, the function prints "NO".
- The function assumes that `n` is within the range `[2, 2 * 10^5]` and each element in the list `a` is within the range `[0, n]`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations mention a postcondition that states `visit` should be a list of length `n` where each element is not `-1`. However, the actual code does not update `visit` if no valid distance condition is found, which would cause the function to incorrectly print "YES" and the coordinates without checking all elements. This is a critical oversight. To correct this, the function should ensure that all elements in `visit` are updated before printing "YES".
