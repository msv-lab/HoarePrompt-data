The variable `found` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `dist`, `a[i]`, and `visit[i]`). Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1]), `a[i]` is equal to `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, `found` is `True`**
