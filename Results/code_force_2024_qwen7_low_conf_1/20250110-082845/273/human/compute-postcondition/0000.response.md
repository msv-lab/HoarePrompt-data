`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` is still valid.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n for all 0 <= i < n; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5**
