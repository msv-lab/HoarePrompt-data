Postcondition: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is less than `n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a[i]` is equal to the final `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1` if `dist` equals `a[i]` and is unchanged otherwise, `found` is `False` since the if condition is entered when `found` is `True`.**
