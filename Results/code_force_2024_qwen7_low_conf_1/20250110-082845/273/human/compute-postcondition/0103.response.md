Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `positions` is a list of `n` tuples, each initially containing `(i + 1, i + 1)`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n - 1`.
- `visit` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.

### Loop to Analyze:
```
for pos in positions:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State of `positions`:**
   - Each tuple in `positions` is initialized to `(i + 1, i + 1)`.
   - Therefore, the initial state of `positions` can be represented as a list of tuples like `[ (1, 1), (2, 2), ..., (n, n) ]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `pos` in the `positions` list.
   - For the loop to execute, `positions` must be a non-empty list, i.e., it must contain at least one tuple.

3. **Requirement for Loop Execution:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `positions`, `positions` must have at least one element.
   - Given that `positions` is a list of `n` tuples, with `n` being a non-negative integer, the list `positions` will always be non-empty as long as `n > 0`.

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The `visit` list is not directly involved in the loop condition but is used in the loop body.
   - However, for the loop to execute, we only need to ensure that `positions` is non-empty.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `positions` is a non-empty list. This is inherently true given the description that `positions` is a list of `n` tuples, and `n` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, no additional state adjustments are required beyond the initial conditions.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list of `n` tuples, each initially containing `(i + 1, i + 1)`, and `visit` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.**
