Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If `i` is not equal to `j`, then `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `found` is `True` and `visit[i]` is `j + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `found` and `visit[i]` remain unchanged.**
