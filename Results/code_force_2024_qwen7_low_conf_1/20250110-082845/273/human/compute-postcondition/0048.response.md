`found` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, the first element `visit[0]` is `n`, the current value of `i` is not equal to `j`, and `visit[n-2]` is `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, `found` is `True`, the first element `visit[0]` is `n`, the current value of `i` is not equal to `j`, and `visit[n-2]` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, `found` is `True`, the first element `visit[0]` is `n`, the current value of `i` is not equal to `j`, and `visit[n-2]` is `n`**
