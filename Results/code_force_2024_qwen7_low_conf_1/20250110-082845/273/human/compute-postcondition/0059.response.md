According to the code, the loop condition for the `for j in range(n):` loop depends on the variable `j`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n-2`
- `j` is `n-1`
- `found` is `True`
- `visit[0]` is `n`
- The current value of `i` is not equal to `j`
- `visit[n-2]` is `n`
- `dist` is `|positions[n-2][0] - positions[n-1][0]| + |positions[n-2][1] - positions[n-1][1]|`
- If `dist` equals `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from its current value of `n-1`. Therefore, `j` becomes `n`.

Let's verify other states:
- `n` remains unchanged since it is a constant for this loop.
- `i` remains `n-2` because it is not part of the loop.
- `found` remains `True` unless explicitly changed within the loop.
- `visit[0]` and `visit[n-2]` remain unchanged.
- `dist` remains unchanged unless explicitly updated within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n`, `found` is `True`, `visit[0]` is `n`, the current value of `i` is not equal to `j`, `visit[n-2]` is `n`, and `dist` is `|positions[n-2][0] - positions[n-1][0]| + |positions[n-2][1] - positions[n-1][1]|.`**
