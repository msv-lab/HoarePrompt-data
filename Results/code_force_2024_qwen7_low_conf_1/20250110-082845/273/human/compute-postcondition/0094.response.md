Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is less than `n - 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j][0] - positions[j][1]`, `a[i]` is equal to the new `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, and `found` is `True`. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
