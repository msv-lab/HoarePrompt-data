The code `visit[i] = j + 1` assigns the value of `j + 1` to the variable `visit[i]`. Given the initial conditions, the only variables affected are `visit[i]`, which is now assigned the value of `j + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, and the current value of `dist` is equal to `a[i]`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`**
