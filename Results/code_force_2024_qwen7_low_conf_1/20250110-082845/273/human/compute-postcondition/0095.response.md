Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is less than `n - 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j + 1]`, `a[i]` is equal to the new `dist`, `visit[i]` is either `j + 1` or `j + 2` depending on whether `dist` equals `a[i]` or not, and `found` is `True` unless the most internal loop or if statement breaks out due to `dist` equaling `a[i]`***
