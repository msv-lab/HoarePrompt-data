Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `positions` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple being `(i + 1, i + 1)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n - 1`.
   - `visit` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.

3. **Required States for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`, `n` should be greater than 0).
   - Before entering the loop, `i` must be set to 0, as the loop starts with `i = 0`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Adjust `n` to be greater than 0.
   - Set `i` to 0.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, positions is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple being `(i + 1, i + 1)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n - 1`, visit is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`**. 

So, the answer is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, positions is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple being `(i + 1, i + 1)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n - 1`, visit is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`**.
