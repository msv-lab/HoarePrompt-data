The code `visit[i] = j + 1` assigns the value of `j + 1` to `visit[i]`. Based on the initial state, `j` is less than `n`, so `j + 1` is a valid integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is less than `n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a[i]` is equal to the new `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, and `found` is `True`.**
