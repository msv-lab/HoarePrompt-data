According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, and `positions` contains the tuple `(i + 1, i + 1)`. Since the loop increments `i` with each iteration, we need to check the condition for the next iteration.

Let's analyze the state step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: `n` must be greater than 0.
2. **Previous Iteration**: After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented from its initial value (which is 0). Let's assume the previous iteration ended with `i = 0` (since it's the first iteration), then `n` must still be greater than 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration to occur, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration, in the next iteration `i` will be 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated conditions:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- The tuple in `positions` will remain the same since the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `positions`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `positions` contains the tuple `(i + 1, i + 1)`**
