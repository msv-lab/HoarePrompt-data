Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list of `n` tuples, each initially containing `(i + 1, i + 1)`, and `visit` is a list of length `n` where each element is not `-1`; the output of the print statement is a sequence of tuples `(x, y)` where each tuple represents a position in `positions`. For each `i` in `range(n)`, there exists a `j` (where `i != j`) such that the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]` is equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each tuple in the `positions` list and prints its elements.
- Since the loop runs `n` times (as there are `n` elements in `positions`), it will print all `n` tuples.
- For the loop to execute `n` times, each `visit[i]` must be set to a value other than `-1` for some valid `j` (where `i != j`) such that the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]` is equal to `a[i]`.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, all `visit` values will be set to a valid index `j` (indicating that such a `j` exists), and the `print` statements will output all the tuples in `positions`.

If the loop does not execute (which is not possible given the initial conditions and the nature of the problem):
- This would imply that no valid `j` could be found for any `i` such that the Manhattan distance condition is met, but since the output states indicate the loop executes multiple times, this scenario is not applicable here.
