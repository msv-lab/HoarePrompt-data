Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `positions` is a list of `n` tuples, and the first tuple in the list is `(1, 1)`.
- `visit` is a list of length `n` where the first element is not `-1`.
- The output is `1 1`.

### For Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each position in the `positions` list:
```python
for pos in positions:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `positions` list.
2. **First Tuple**: The first tuple in `positions` is `(1, 1)`.
3. **Visit List**: The `visit` list has its first element set to a value other than `-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `positions` is a list of `n` tuples starting with `(1, 1)`.
   - `visit` is a list of length `n` with the first element not being `-1`.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - To determine the next state, we need to check if the loop can continue.
   - Since the loop iterates over `positions`, it will continue as long as there are elements in `positions`.

3. **Modification of States**:
   - After processing the current position, the loop moves to the next position in the `positions` list.
   - The `visit` list will remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the only thing that changes is the position being processed. The first element of `positions` will move to the next tuple, and `visit` will remain as it is unless modified inside the loop body.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list of `n` tuples where the second tuple is (1, 1), `visit` is a list of length `n` where the first element is not -1**.

So, the final state before the next iteration is:
```
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list of `n` tuples where the second tuple is (1, 1), `visit` is a list of length `n` where the first element is not -1**
```
