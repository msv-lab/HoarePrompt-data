The code `print(pos[0], pos[1])` simply prints the first tuple in the list `pos`. Since the initial state of `pos` is a list of `n` tuples, each initially containing `(i + 1, i + 1)`, the first tuple in the list `pos` is `(1, 1)` (as `i` starts from 0). No variables are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `(1, 1)`, but this does not change the values of the variables `n`, `positions`, or `visit`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list of `n` tuples, each initially containing `(i + 1, i + 1)`, and `visit` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`; the output of the print statement is `(1, 1)`**
