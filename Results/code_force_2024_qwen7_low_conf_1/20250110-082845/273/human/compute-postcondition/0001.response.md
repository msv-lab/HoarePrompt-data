`a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input, split by spaces, and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The length of this list is equal to the original value of `n`, and each element in the list is an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive). The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, split by spaces, and converted to integers; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5**
