The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most internal if statement we were inside. In this case, there is no loop or if statement that the `break` statement would affect, so the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[i]` is 3, `found` is `True`**
