`found` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `n`, `j`, `i`, `dist`, and `visit[i]` remain unchanged. The only change is that `found` is now set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `found` is `True`, and `visit[i]` is `j + 1`**
