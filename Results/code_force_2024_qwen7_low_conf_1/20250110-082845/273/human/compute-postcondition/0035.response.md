Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `i` is not equal to `j`. The value of `visit[i]` remains unchanged, and `found` remains unchanged unless `dist` (the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`) equals `a[i]`, in which case `visit[i]` is set to 2 and `found` is set to `True`.***
