Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list of `n` tuples, each initially containing `(i + 1, i + 1)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n - 1`, `visit` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, and for each `i` in `range(n)`, `visit[i]` is set to `j + 1` if a valid `j` (where `i != j`) is found such that the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise `visit[i]` remains `-1`.**
