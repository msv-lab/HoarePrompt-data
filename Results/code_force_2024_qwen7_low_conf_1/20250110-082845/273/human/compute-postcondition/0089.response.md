According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `i` is an integer
- `j` is an integer and `j` is less than `n`
- `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`
- `a[i]` is equal to the new `dist`
- `visit[i]` is `j + 1`
- `found` is `True`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `j + 1`. Since `j` was less than `n` in the previous iteration, `j + 1` must still be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is less than `n - 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j + 1]`, `a[i]` is equal to the new `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 2`, and `found` is `True`.**

Note: `j + 1` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue, and `j + 2` is the value `visit[i]` would take in the next iteration.
