Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, `found` is `True`, the first element `visit[0]` is `n`, the current value of `i` is not equal to `j`, and `visit[n-2]` is `n`. This is because either `dist == a[i]` leads to setting `found` to `True` and breaking out of the loop, or there is no else part, so the values remain as they were initially specified in the precondition.***
