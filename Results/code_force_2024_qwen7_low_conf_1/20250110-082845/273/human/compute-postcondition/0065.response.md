Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n`, `found` is `True`, `visit[0]` is `n`, the current value of `i` is not equal to `j`, `visit[n-2]` is `n`, and `visit[i]` is `n + 1`. `dist` is `abs(positions[n-2][0] - positions[n][0]) + abs(positions[n-2][1] - positions[n][1])`. If `dist == a[i]`, the code `break` is executed, exiting the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of the variables. If `dist != a[i]`, the variables remain unchanged.***
