`visit[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. Given that `i` is `n-2` and `j` is `n-1`, we can substitute these values into the equation. So, `visit[n-2]` is assigned the value `(n-1) + 1`, which simplifies to `visit[n-2]` is `n`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, `found` is `False`, the first element `visit[0]` is `n`, the current value of `i` is not equal to `j`, and `visit[n-2]` is `n`.**
