The code calculates the Manhattan distance between two points `positions[i]` and `positions[j]` using the absolute differences in their coordinates. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged, but a new variable `dist` is introduced, which holds the calculated distance.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is an integer
- `j` is an integer
- `i` is not equal to `j`

After executing the code:
- `dist` is assigned the value `abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])**
