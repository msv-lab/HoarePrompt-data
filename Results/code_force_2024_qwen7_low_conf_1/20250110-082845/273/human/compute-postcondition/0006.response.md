The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, i + 1)` to the list `positions`. Since the initial state of `positions` is the tuple `(i + 1, i + 1)`, appending this tuple will result in `positions` containing two tuples: the initial one and the newly appended one. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `positions` contains the tuples `(i + 1, i + 1)` and `((i + 1, i + 1),)`**
