The code `print(pos[0], pos[1])` accesses the first tuple in the `positions` list, which is `(1, 1)`, and prints its elements. This does not modify any of the existing variables but instead outputs the values of `pos[0]` and `pos[1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `positions` is a list of `n` tuples where the first tuple is `(1, 1)`
- `visit` is a list of length `n` where the first element is not `-1`

The output of the print statement will be `1 1`. However, since the code only prints and does not assign any new values, the variables `n`, `positions`, and `visit` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `positions` is a list of `n` tuples where the first tuple is (1, 1), `visit` is a list of length `n` where the first element is not -1, and the output is 1 1**
