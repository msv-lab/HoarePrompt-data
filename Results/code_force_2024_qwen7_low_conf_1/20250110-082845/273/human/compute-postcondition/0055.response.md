`found` is reassigned to `True`, but the value of `found` does not change because it was already `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, `found` is `True`, the first element `visit[0]` is `n`, the current value of `i` is not equal to `j`, `visit[n-2]` is `n`, and `dist` is `|positions[n-2][0] - positions[n-1][0]| + |positions[n-2][1] - positions[n-1][1]|`.**
