The code initializes a list `visit` with `-1` repeated `n` times. This means that each element in the `visit` list will be set to `-1`. The length of the `visit` list is `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `positions` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple being `(i + 1, i + 1)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n - 1`; `visit` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.**
