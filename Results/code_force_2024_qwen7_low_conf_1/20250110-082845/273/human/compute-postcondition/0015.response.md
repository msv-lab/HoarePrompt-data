The code calculates the distance between two points `positions[i]` and `positions[j]` using the Manhattan distance formula. However, the initial state does not include the value of `positions`. Since `positions` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `dist`. We only know that `dist` is assigned the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`**
