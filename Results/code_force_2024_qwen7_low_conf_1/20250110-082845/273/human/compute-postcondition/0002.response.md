The code initializes an empty list called `positions`. No operations are performed on `a` or `n`, and no values are assigned to them. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `positions` list.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, split by spaces, and converted to integers; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `positions` is an empty list**
