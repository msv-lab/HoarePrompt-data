The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is mentioned in the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged after the execution.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is less than `n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a[i]` is equal to the new `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, and `found` is `True`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
