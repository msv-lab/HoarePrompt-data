The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, i + 1)` to the list `positions`. Given that `i` is 1, the tuple to be appended is `(2, 2)`. Initially, `positions` contains the tuples `(1, 1)` and `((1, 1),)`. After appending `(2, 2)`, the updated `positions` will contain `(1, 1)`, `((1, 1),)`, and `(2, 2)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `positions` contains the tuples `(1, 1)`, `((1, 1),)`, and `(2, 2)`**
