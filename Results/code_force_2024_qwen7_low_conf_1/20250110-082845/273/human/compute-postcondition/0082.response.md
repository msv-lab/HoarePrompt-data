Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` and `j` are integers.
   - `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`.
   - `a[i]` is equal to `dist`.
   - `visit[i]` is `j + 1`.
   - `found` is `True`.
   - The condition `i != j` is true, meaning these assignments hold.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, where `n` is some integer.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, `j` takes on values from `0` to `n-1`.
   - We need to check if the assignment conditions apply for each `j`.

4. **Conditions for Loop to Execute Again**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.

5. **State After Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` and `j` are integers.
   - `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`.
   - `a[i]` is equal to `dist`.
   - `visit[i]` is `j + 1`.
   - `found` is `True`.
   - `i != j` is true, so the assignments hold.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

7. **Updated State**:
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `dist` remains the same (since it is based on the fixed `i` and `positions`).
   - `a[i]` remains the same.
   - `visit[i]` remains the same.
   - `found` remains `True` because `i != j` still holds true in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer and `j` is less than `n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a[i]` is equal to `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, and `found` is `True`.**
