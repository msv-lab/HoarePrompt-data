Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visit[i]` is set to 2 and `found` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `visit[i]` remains unchanged and `found` remains as initially set.***
