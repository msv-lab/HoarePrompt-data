Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a[i]` is equal to `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, and `found` is `True`. If `i != j` is true, these assignments hold. If `i != j` is false, no changes occur and the original values of `a[i]`, `visit[i]`, and `found` remain unchanged.***
