The code `break` is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we are in. However, there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `found` is `True`, and `visit[i]` is `j + 1`.**
