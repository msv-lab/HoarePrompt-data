The `break` statement is executed, which typically means breaking out of a loop or a nested structure. However, in this context, since there is no loop or nested structure provided in the code snippet, the only change is that the flow of the program will exit the current block. The values of the variables `i`, `j`, `dist`, `a[i]`, `visit[i]`, and `found` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1]), `a[i]` is equal to `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, `found` is `True`**
