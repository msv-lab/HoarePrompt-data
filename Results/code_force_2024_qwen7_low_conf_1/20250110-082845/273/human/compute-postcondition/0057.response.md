Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, `found` is `True`, the first element `visit[0]` is `n`, the current value of `i` is not equal to `j`, `visit[n-2]` is `n`, and `dist` is `|positions[n-2][0] - positions[n-1][0]| + |positions[n-2][1] - positions[n-1][1]|. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***
