Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, and `found` is `True`. `visit[i]` contains the value of `j + 1` for the last successful iteration where the condition `dist == a[i]` was met, and all other `visit` entries that were updated during the loop are also set accordingly. `i` is decremented until it reaches -1, and the loop stops executing.**
