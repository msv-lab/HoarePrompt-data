The code `visit[i] = j + 1` assigns the value of `j + 1` to `visit[i]`. The variables `i`, `j`, `dist`, and `a[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i` is not equal to `j`, `dist` is abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1]), `a[i]` is equal to `dist`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`**
