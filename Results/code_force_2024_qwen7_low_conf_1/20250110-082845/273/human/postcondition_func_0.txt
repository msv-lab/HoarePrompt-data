The function processes a list of integers `a` of size `n` and checks if it is possible to assign coordinates to `n` positions such that the Manhattan distance between each position `i` and another position `j` equals `a[i]` if `i` is not equal to `j`. If such an assignment is possible, it prints "YES" followed by the coordinates of the positions and the indices of the positions that satisfy the distance conditions. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
