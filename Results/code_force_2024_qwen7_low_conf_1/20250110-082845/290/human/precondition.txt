N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The input also includes descriptions of the field (N lines of M pairs of characters), an integer T representing the number of steps, and T lines of actions describing what each entity (player or ball) does in each step. Each team is represented by 'R' and 'B', and players are numbered uniquely within their team. The field also contains goals ('RG' for a red goal and 'BG' for a blue goal) and the Quaffle ('.Q').
