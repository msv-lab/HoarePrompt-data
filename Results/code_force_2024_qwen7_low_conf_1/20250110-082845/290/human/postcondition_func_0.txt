The function processes a game simulation based on a 2D field representation. It starts by parsing the initial field configuration, including the dimensions \(N\) and \(M\), the field itself, the number of steps \(T\), and the sequence of actions. It then iterates through each action, updating the positions of players and handling Quaffle transfers. If the Quaffle reaches a goal, it updates the score for the opposing team and resets the Quaffle to the center of the field. After processing all steps, it prints the final score.
