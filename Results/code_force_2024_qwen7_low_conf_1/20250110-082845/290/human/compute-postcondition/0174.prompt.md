You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a 2D list of strings, where each string contains M characters, and the first line is a header indicating the dimensions of the field. The field contains up to 10 players for each team, represented by 'R0' to 'R9' for the red team and 'B0' to 'B9' for the blue team. There is exactly one Quaffle represented by '.Q'. Each team has between 1 and 5 goals, represented by 'RG' for a red goal and 'BG' for a blue goal. The number of steps T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. Each step is described by a string indicating the action performed by an entity on the field, where the action can be moving ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'), catching a ball ('C' followed by the ball type), or throwing the Quaffle ('T').
def func_1():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    field = [input().split() for _ in range(N)]
    T = int(input())
    actions = [input().split() for _ in range(T)]
    quaffle_position = None
    goals = {'RG': 0, 'BG': 0}
    players = {'R': {}, 'B': {}}
    score = {'R': 0, 'B': 0}
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(M):
            if field[i][j] == '.Q':
                quaffle_position = i, j
            elif field[i][j] in ['RG', 'BG']:
                goals[field[i][j]] += 1
            elif field[i][j][0] in ['R', 'B']:
                team, number = field[i][j]
                players[team][number] = i, j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; `M` is an integer, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; `field` is a 2D list of strings representing the field; `T` is an integer, input from the user; `actions` is a list of T lists of strings created by splitting each input line by spaces; `quaffle_position` is a tuple containing the last row and column index where field[i][j] is '.Q'; `goals` is a dictionary where goals['RG'] is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and goals['BG'] is the total number of occurrences of 'BG'; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices.
    for (t, (entity, action, *args)) in enumerate(actions):
        if action == 'U':
            players[entity[0]][entity[1]] = players[entity[0]][entity[1]][0
                ] - 1, players[entity[0]][entity[1]][1]

        elif action == 'L':
            players[entity[0]][entity[1]] = players[entity[0]][entity[1]][0], players[
                entity[0]][entity[1]][1] - 1
        elif action == 'R':
            players[entity[0]][entity[1]] = players[entity[0]][entity[1]][0], players[
                entity[0]][entity[1]][1] + 1
        elif action == 'C':
            pass
        elif action == 'T':
            quaffle_position = players[entity[0]][entity[1]]
        
        if quaffle_position in goals:
            scoring_team = 'R' if quaffle_position in ['BG'] else 'B'
            opposite_team = 'B' if scoring_team == 'R' else 'R'
            score[opposite_team] += 1
            print(f'{t} {opposite_team.upper()} GOAL')
            quaffle_position = (N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is `T-1`, `scoring_team` is 'B' or 'R' depending on the final position of the quaffle, `quaffle_position` is the final position of the quaffle after all actions, `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices, `score` is a dictionary with the scores for teams 'R' and 'B', and `opposite_team` is 'R' if `scoring_team` is 'B' and vice versa. If the loop does not execute, the initial values of `t`, `scoring_team`, `quaffle_position`, `goals`, `players`, `score`, and `opposite_team` remain unchanged.
    print(f"FINAL SCORE: {score['R']} {score['B']}")
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a 2D list representing the field, integers `N` and `M` representing the dimensions of the field, and an integer `T` representing the number of steps. After processing all steps, it returns the final state of the field.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
