Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is the same; `j` is the same; `red_score` is the same; `blue_score` is the same; `quaffle_position` is the same; `entity` is the first element of the list `action` obtained from `data[N + 2 + t]`; `command` is the second element of the list `action` obtained from `data[N + 2 + t]`; if `command` is 'C', `ball` is the same and `quaffle_carrier` is `entity` if `ball` is equal to '.Q'. Otherwise, `quaffle_carrier` is either `None` if `command` is 'T' or remains unchanged if `command` is neither 'C' nor 'T'.***
