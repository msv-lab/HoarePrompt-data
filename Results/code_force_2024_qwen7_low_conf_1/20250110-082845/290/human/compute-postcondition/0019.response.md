Postcondition: ***`j` is now `i`, `i` is now `j`, `M` is greater than 0, `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the second character of `field[i][j]`, and `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q', and `field[i][j]` is not in ['RG', 'BG'], regardless of whether the condition `field[i][j][0] in ['R', 'B']` is true or false.***
