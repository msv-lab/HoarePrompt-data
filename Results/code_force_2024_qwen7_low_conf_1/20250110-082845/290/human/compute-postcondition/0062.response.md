The code `quaffle_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle_position`. Given the initial state where `i` is `N` and `j` is `0`, the value of `quaffle_position` is updated to `(N, 0)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is `(N, 0)`, `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` count the occurrences of 'RG' and 'BG' respectively, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]` (one of them may be incremented by 1), `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`, `i` is `N`, and `j` is `0`.**
