The variable `quaffle_position` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. The values of `i` and `j` are known from the initial state: `i` represents the row where 'Q' is located (specifically, `i` is 0 since 'Q' is at position `[i][0]`), and `j` is 0. 

The states of the other variables (`M`, `field[i][j]`, and the position of 'Q' in the `field` list) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is (0, 0), the current value of `field[i][j]` is '.', and the character 'Q' is at position `[0][0]` in the `field` list**
