The code assigns the value of `i, j` to `quaffle_position`. Given the initial state, `i` is `N`, and `j` is within the range `0` to `M-1` but incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` is `N + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is `N, N + 1`, `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` count the occurrences of 'RG' and 'BG' respectively, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`, `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`, `i` is `N`, and `j` is `N + 1`.**
