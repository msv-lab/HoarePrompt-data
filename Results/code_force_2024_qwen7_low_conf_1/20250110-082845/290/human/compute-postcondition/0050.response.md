Postcondition: ***`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is the last position where `field[i][j]` is '.Q', `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field such that if `field[i][j][0]` is either 'R' or 'B', then `players[team][number]` is `N, j`, `i` is `N`, `j` is within the range `0` to `M-1`, `team` is 'R' or 'B', and `number` is a digit. If `field[i][j][0]` is not 'R' or 'B', the condition remains unchanged.***
