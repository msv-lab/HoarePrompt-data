Postcondition: **`M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is either (0, M-1) if the condition `field[0][M-1] == '.Q'` is true, or the last position where `field[0][j]` is not '.' or 'Q'; `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` are updated based on the values encountered in the loop; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the values encountered in the loop; `i` is 0; `j` is `M`. If `field[i][j]` is in ['RG', 'BG'], `goals[field[0][M]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `players[team][number]` is set to (0, M), where `team` is the team of the player at position (0, M) and `number` is the number of the player at position (0, M).**
