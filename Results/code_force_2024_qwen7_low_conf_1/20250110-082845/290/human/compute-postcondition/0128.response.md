The code `opposite_team = 'B' if scoring_team == 'R' else 'R'` checks the value of `scoring_team` and assigns `'B'` to `opposite_team` if `scoring_team` is `'R'`, otherwise assigns `'R'` to `opposite_team`. Given that `scoring_team` is `'B'`, the condition `scoring_team == 'R'` is `False`, so `opposite_team` will be assigned the value `'R'`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `M` are integers, both odd and within the range [3, 99]; `field` is a 2D list of strings; `T` is an integer, input from the user; `actions` must have at least one element, `t` is 0; `scoring_team` is `'B'`; `quaffle_position` is a tuple containing the last row and column index where `field[i][j]` is '.Q'; `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG'; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices; `opposite_team` is `'R'`.
