The code prints the formatted string f'{t} {opposite_team.upper()} GOAL'. Here, `t` is 2 and `opposite_team` is 'R'. So, the string printed will be '2 R GOAL'. However, printing does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 2; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `opposite_team` is 'R'; `score['R']` is 1**
