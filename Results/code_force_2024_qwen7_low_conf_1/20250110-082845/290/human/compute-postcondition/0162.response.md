Postcondition: ***`t` is 2; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `quaffle_position` is ((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1); `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG'; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field. Depending on the value of `action`:
- If `action` is 'L', the y-coordinate of the player from `entity` is decreased by 1.
- If `action` is 'R', the position of the player from `entity` is updated to `(x, y + 1)` (where `(x, y)` is the original position).
- If neither 'L' nor 'R' is given, no changes occur to `players`.
If `quaffle_position` is found in `goals`, a string '1 R GOAL' is printed and `score['R']` remains unchanged; `opposite_team` is 'R'.***
