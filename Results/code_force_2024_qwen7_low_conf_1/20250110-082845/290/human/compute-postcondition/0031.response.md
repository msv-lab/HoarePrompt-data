The code assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle_position`. However, the initial value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, only `j` is known to be 2 and `M` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is not defined before this line, it remains undefined. Therefore, `quaffle_position` will be a tuple containing `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `M` must be greater than 0; `quaffle_position` is (i, 2)**
