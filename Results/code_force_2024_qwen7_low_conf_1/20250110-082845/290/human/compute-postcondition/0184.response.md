Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is the same; `j` is the same; `red_score` is the same; `blue_score` is the same; `quaffle_position` is the same; `entity` is the first element of the list `action` obtained from `data[N + 2 + t]`; `command` is the second element of the list `action` obtained from `data[N + 2 + t]`; `x` and `y` are updated based on the following conditions: if `command` is 'D', then `x` is `positions[entity][0]` + 1 and `y` is `positions[entity][1]`; if `command` is 'L', then `x` is `positions[entity][0]` and `y` is `positions[entity][1] - 1`; if `command` is 'R', then `x` is `positions[entity][0]` and `y` is `positions[entity][1] + 1`.***
