The code snippet `quaffle_position = (N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1` references `N` and `M`, which are not defined in the initial state. Since these variables are not provided and their values are not known, they cannot be calculated. Therefore, the variables `t`, `scoring_team`, `opposite_team`, and `score['R']` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `opposite_team` is 'R'; `score['R']` is 1**
