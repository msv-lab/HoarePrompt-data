The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- A 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string contains M characters.
- An integer `N` representing the number of rows in the field.
- An integer `M` representing the number of columns in the field.
- An integer `T` representing the number of steps.

After executing the function body, it processes each step and performs actions based on the entities' movements and interactions within the field. The function returns a result based on the final state of the field after all steps are processed. However, since no specific return value is mentioned in the output cases, it can be inferred that the function might return a summary of the final state, such as the positions of all players and the Quaffle, the number of goals scored by each team, etc.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a 2D list representing the field, along with the dimensions `N` and `M`, and the number of steps `T`, and return the final state of the field after processing all the steps.

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list representing the field, integers `N` and `M` representing the dimensions of the field, and an integer `T` representing the number of steps. After processing all steps, it returns the final state of the field.**
