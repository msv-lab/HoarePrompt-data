The given code simply prints the final score using an f-string. It does not change any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `t`, `scoring_team`, `quaffle_position`, `goals`, `players`, `score`, and `opposite_team` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `T-1`, `scoring_team` is 'B' or 'R', `quaffle_position` is the final position of the quaffle after all actions, `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG', `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices, `score` is a dictionary with the scores for teams 'R' and 'B', and `opposite_team` is 'R' if `scoring_team` is 'B' and vice versa. The print statement outputs the final score as "FINAL SCORE: {score['R']} {score['B']}".**
