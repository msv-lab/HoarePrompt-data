Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is the same; `j` is the same; `red_score` is the same; `blue_score` is the same; `quaffle_position` is either \((N - 1) // 2, (M - 1) // 2\) if `cell == 'BG'` or remains the same; `entity` is the same; `command` is the same; `positions[entity]` is updated to \([x, y]\) based on the command if `command` is in 'UDLR'; if `command` is 'C', `quaffle_carrier` is `entity` if `ball` is equal to '.Q'; otherwise, `quaffle_carrier` is either `None` if `command` is 'T' or remains unchanged if `command` is neither 'C' nor 'T'; `x` and `y` are the coordinates of `quaffle_position` unless `cell == 'BG'` in which case they are \((N - 1) // 2\) and \((M - 1) // 2\) respectively; `cell` is either the value at `field[(N - 1) // 2][(M - 1) // 2]` if `cell == 'BG'` or remains the same; a string '{t} RED GOAL' is printed if `cell == 'BG'`.***
