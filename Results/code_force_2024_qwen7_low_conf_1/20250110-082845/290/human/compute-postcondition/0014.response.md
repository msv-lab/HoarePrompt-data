The code `goals[field[i][j]] += 1` increments the value of `goals[field[i][j]]` by 1. Given the initial state, `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', and `goals` is a dictionary that does not initially contain 'RG' or 'BG' as keys (since no such key-value pairs are mentioned in the initial state).

Therefore, after executing the code, the value of `goals[field[i][j]]` will be 1 because it is being incremented from 0 (the default value for non-existent keys in dictionaries).

- `j` remains unchanged, so it is still 0.
- `M` remains unchanged, so it is still greater than 0.
- `field[i][j]` remains unchanged, so it is still either 'RG' or 'BG'.
- `goals[field[i][j]]` is now 1.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `M` is greater than 0, `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `goals[field[i][j]]` is 1**
