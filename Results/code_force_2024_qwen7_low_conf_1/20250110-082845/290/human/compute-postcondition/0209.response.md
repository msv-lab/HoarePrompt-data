The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the problem description, the function operates on a grid defined by dimensions N and M, where N and M are integers satisfying 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd. The grid contains specific characters representing empty space, players, goals, or the Quaffle. Additionally, the function takes an integer T indicating the number of steps, followed by T lines describing the actions performed by entities on the field.

Since the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, we can infer that the function modifies the grid state or performs some actions based on the given inputs but does not return a value.

Functionality: **The function accepts the dimensions N and M of an N x M grid (both N and M are integers and satisfy 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and are odd), the integer T indicating the number of steps, and T lines describing actions performed by entities on the field. It modifies the grid state or performs actions based on these inputs but does not return a value.**
