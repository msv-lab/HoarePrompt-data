Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `scoring_team` is 'B', `quaffle_position` is ((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1), `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices, `score['R']` remains unchanged, and `opposite_team` is 'R'. If `action` is 'D', `players['B'][1]` is updated to `(row + 1, col)`. If `action` is 'L', the position of a player in team 'B' is updated to (original_row, original_column - 1). If `action` is 'R', the position of player 1 in team 'B' is updated to (row, col + 1). If `action` is 'C', no changes occur.***
