The code snippet prints the final scores of the red and blue teams using an f-string. However, this does not change any of the variable values or their states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `j` is `M-1`, `T` is 0, `red_score` is either 0 or an even number, `blue_score` is either 0 or an odd number, `quaffle_carrier` is `None`, `quaffle_position` is `((N - 1) // 2, (M - 1) // 2)` if `quaffle_carrier` is `None` and `quaffle_position` is not `None`, otherwise `quaffle_position` is the last position of `.Q` after all commands. The final scores are printed as `FINAL SCORE: {red_score} {blue_score}`.**
