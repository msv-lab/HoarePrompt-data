The code `print(f'{t} {opposite_team.upper()} GOAL')` prints the current value of `t` (which is 0) followed by the uppercase version of `opposite_team` (which is 'R'), and the string 'GOAL'. This does not change any variable values but outputs a message.

Given the initial state:
- `N` and `M` are integers, both odd and within the range [3, 99]
- `field` is a 2D list of strings
- `T` is an integer, input from the user
- `actions` must have at least one element
- `t` is 0
- `scoring_team` is 'B'
- `quaffle_position` is a tuple containing the last row and column index where `field[i][j]` is '.Q'
- `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG'
- `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices
- `score`['R'] is 1 more than its previous value
- `opposite_team` is 'R'

After executing the code, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is 0; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `quaffle_position` is a tuple containing the last row and column index where `field[i][j]` is '.Q'; `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG'; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices; `score`['R'] is 1 more than its previous value; `opposite_team` is 'R'; print statement: '0 R GOAL'**
