Postcondition: ***`M` is greater than 0; `quaffle_position` is either (0, M) if `field[0][M]` is '.Q', or the last position where `field[0][j]` is not '.' or 'Q'; `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` are updated based on the values encountered in the loop; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the values encountered in the loop; `i` is 0; `j` is `M`. If `field[0][M]` is '.Q', `quaffle_position` is set to (0, M). If `field[0][M]` is 'RG', `goals['RG']` is incremented by 1. If `field[0][M]` is 'BG', `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. If `field[0][M]` starts with 'R' or 'B', the player corresponding to `field[0][M]` is positioned at (0, M). No changes occur if `field[0][M]` is neither '.Q', 'RG', 'BG', nor starts with 'R' or 'B'.***
