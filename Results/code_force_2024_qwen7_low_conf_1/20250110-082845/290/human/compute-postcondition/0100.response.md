Output State: **`M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is the last position where `field[i][j]` is '.Q', `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG', updated based on the values encountered in the loop, `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the values encountered in the loop, `i` is 0, and `j` is `M-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all columns (`j` from 0 to `M-1`) in the first row (`i` fixed at 0).
- For each cell, the following actions are performed:
  - If `field[i][j] == '.Q'`, the `quaffle_position` is updated to `(i, j)`.
  - If `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', the corresponding count in the `goals` dictionary is incremented.
  - If `field[i][j]` starts with 'R' or 'B', it indicates a player's position, and this information is stored in the `players` dictionary.

After the loop completes all its iterations, the final state will reflect the last occurrence of `.Q`, the total counts of 'RG' and 'BG', and the positions of all players in the first row. The values of `i` and `j` will be as they were initialized, specifically `i = 0` and `j = M-1`.
