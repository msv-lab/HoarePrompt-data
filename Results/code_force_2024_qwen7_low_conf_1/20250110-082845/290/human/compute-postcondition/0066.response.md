Postcondition: **`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` remains unchanged or becomes `N, N + 1` depending on the condition, `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` count the occurrences of 'RG' and 'BG' respectively, `players[team][number]` is now `N, 0`, `i` is `N`, and `j` is `0`. Here, `team` is the value from `field[N][0][0]` and `number` is the value from `field[N][0][1]` if the condition `field[i][j][0] in ['R', 'B']` is true. If the condition is false, the variables remain in their preconditions' states.**
