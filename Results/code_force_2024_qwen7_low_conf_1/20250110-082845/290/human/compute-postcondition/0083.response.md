Postcondition: ***`M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is either (0, M-1) if the condition `field[i][j] == '.Q'` is true, or the last position where `field[i][j]` is not '.' or 'Q'. `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG', updated based on the values encountered in the loop. `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the values encountered in the loop. `i` is 0, and `j` is `M-1`.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts, summarizing the overall state of the program variables after the if-else block executes.
