Postcondition: ***`t` is 2; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `quaffle_position` is the position of the player from team `entity[0]` in the `players` dictionary; `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG'; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field; if `quaffle_position` is found in `goals`, a string '1 R GOAL' is printed and `score['R']` remains unchanged; `opposite_team` is 'R'. Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition remains the same as the if part.***
