Postcondition: ***`M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is either (0, M) if `field[0][M]` is '.Q', or the last position where `field[0][j]` is not '.' or 'Q', `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` are updated based on the values encountered in the loop, `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field. If `field[i][j][0]` is in ['R', 'B'], then `players[team][number]` is set to (0, M), `team` is the first element of `field[0][M]`, and `number` is the second element of `field[0][M]`. No changes occur if the condition `field[i][j][0] in ['R', 'B']` is not met.***
