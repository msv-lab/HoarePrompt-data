Postcondition: ***`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is the last position where `field[N][j]` is '.Q', `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is `x + 1` if `field[i][j]` is 'RG' else `x`, and `goals['BG']` is `y + 1` if `field[i][j]` is 'BG' else `y`, `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field. If `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', the updated dictionary keeps track of these counts. If `field[i][j][0]` is 'R' or 'B', then `players[team][number]` is `N, j`. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged. `i` is `N`, `j` is within the range `0` to `M-1`.***
