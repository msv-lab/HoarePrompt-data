Postcondition: ***`t` is 2; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `opposite_team` is 'R'; `score['R']` is 1. If `quaffle_position` is found in `goals`, a string '1 R GOAL' is printed and `score['R']` remains unchanged. If `quaffle_position` is not in `goals`, no changes occur to `score['R']` and `opposite_team` remains 'R'.***
