The code creates a list of actions based on user input repeated T times. Each action is a list of strings separated by spaces. The original values of `N`, `M`, `field`, and `T` remain unchanged, but now there is a new list `actions` containing T lists of strings.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; `M` is an integer, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; `field` is a 2D list of strings representing the field; `T` is an integer, input from the user; `actions` is a list of T lists of strings created by splitting each input line by spaces.**
