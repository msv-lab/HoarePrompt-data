The code initializes a dictionary `goals` with two keys `'RG'` and `'BG'` both set to `0`. This does not affect the values of the other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; `M` is an integer, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; `field` is a 2D list of strings representing the field; `T` is an integer, input from the user; `actions` is a list of T lists of strings created by splitting each input line by spaces; `quaffle_position` is `None`; `goals` is a dictionary with `{'RG': 0, 'BG': 0}`.**
