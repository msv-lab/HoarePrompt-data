Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, which iterates over the range from 0 to `M-1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `0` to `M-1`. This means the loop will execute if `j < M`.

3. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `quaffle_position`: The last position where `field[i][j]` is '.Q'. This variable's value doesn't directly affect the loop condition but may be used within the loop.
   - `goals`: A dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG'. These values don't directly impact the loop execution.
   - `players`: A dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field. Similar to `goals`, these values do not directly affect the loop execution.
   - `i`: The initial value of `i` is given as `N`. This value is not directly relevant to the loop condition since the loop iterates over `j`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `j` must be initialized to a value less than `M`.
   - Since `j` starts at 0 (the default starting point for the `range` function), the only adjustment needed is to ensure `M` is greater than 0.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `M` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: `M` must be greater than 0**
