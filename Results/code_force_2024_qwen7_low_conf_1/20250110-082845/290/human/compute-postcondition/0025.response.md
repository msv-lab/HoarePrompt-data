Given the Initial State:
- `j` is 1
- `M` is greater than 0
- If `field[i][j]` is '.Q', the character 'Q' is at position `[0][1]` in the `field` list.
- Otherwise, if `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals[field[i][j]]` is 1.
- If neither condition is met, `j` is now `i`, `i` is now `j`, `team` is either 'R' or 'B', and `number` is the second character of `field[i][j]`.

The code snippet is:
```
team, number = field[i][j]
```

This line of code assigns the values from `field[i][j]` to `team` and `number`. We need to determine the exact values of `team` and `number` based on the given conditions.

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - If `field[i][j]` is '.Q', then `team` would be None and `number` would be None because '.Q' does not match 'RG' or 'BG'.
   - If `field[i][j]` is 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` would be 1, but this does not affect `team` and `number` since we are not assigning these to `team` and `number`.
   - If `field[i][j]` is neither '.Q', 'RG', nor 'BG', then `j` becomes `i`, `i` becomes `j`, `team` is either 'R' or 'B', and `number` is the second character of `field[i][j]`.

Since the specific value of `field[i][j]` is not given, we consider the general case where `field[i][j]` is neither '.Q', 'RG', nor 'BG'.

2. **Assignment**:
   - `j` becomes `i` (but `i` remains unchanged in the current state, so `j` effectively becomes `i`).
   - `i` becomes `j` (so `i` becomes 1).
   - `team` is set to either 'R' or 'B'.
   - `number` is set to the second character of `field[i][j]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 1, `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the second character of `field[1][1]`.**
