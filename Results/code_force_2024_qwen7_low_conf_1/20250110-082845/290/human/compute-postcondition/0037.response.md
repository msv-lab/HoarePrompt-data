Postcondition: ***`j` is 2 and `M` must be greater than 0. If `field[i][2]` is equal to '.Q', the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `field[i][2]` starts with 'R' or 'B', then `players['R' or 'B'][i, j]` or `players['B'][i, j]` is set accordingly. If `field[i][2]` does not start with 'R' or 'B', `goals[field[i][2]]` is incremented by 1.***
