Postcondition: ***`M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is either (0, M) if `field[0][M]` is '.Q', or the last position where `field[0][j]` is not '.' or 'Q', `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is incremented by 1 if `field[0][M]` is 'RG' or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1 if `field[0][M]` is 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the values encountered in the loop, `i` is 0, `j` is `M`. If `field[0][M]` is neither 'RG' nor 'BG' but starts with 'R' or 'B', then the player corresponding to `field[0][M]` is positioned at (0, M). No changes occur if `field[0][M]` does not meet any of these conditions.***
