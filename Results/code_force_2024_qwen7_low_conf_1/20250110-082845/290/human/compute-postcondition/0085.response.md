The code `quaffle_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle_position`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is `M`. Thus, `quaffle_position` is updated to `(0, M)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `M` is greater than 0.
- `quaffle_position` is now `(0, M)`.
- `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG'.
- `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `M`.

Output State: **`M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is (0, M), `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, `i` is 0, and `j` is `M`.**
