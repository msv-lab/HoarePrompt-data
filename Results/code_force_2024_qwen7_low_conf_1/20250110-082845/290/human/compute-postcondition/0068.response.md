Postcondition: ***`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` either remains unchanged or becomes `(N, 0)` based on the condition. `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` count the occurrences of 'RG' and 'BG' respectively, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]` (one of them may be incremented by 1). `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`. If `field[N][0]` is `'RG'`, `goals['RG']` is incremented by 1; if `field[N][0]` is `'BG'`, `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. If `field[N][0]` is neither `'RG'` nor `'BG'`, `players[team][number]` is updated to `(N, 0)`, where `team` is the value from `field[N][0][0]` and `number` is the value from `field[N][0][1]` if the condition `field[i][j][0] in ['R', 'B']` is true. Otherwise, the variables remain in their preconditions' states.***
