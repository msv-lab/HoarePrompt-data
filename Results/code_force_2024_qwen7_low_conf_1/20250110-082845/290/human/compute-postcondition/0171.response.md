Output State: **`t` is `T-1`, `scoring_team` is 'B' or 'R' depending on the final position of the quaffle, `quaffle_position` is the final position of the quaffle after all actions, `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices, `score` is a dictionary with the scores for teams 'R' and 'B', and `opposite_team` is 'R' if `scoring_team` is 'B' and vice versa. If the loop does not execute, the initial values of `t`, `scoring_team`, `quaffle_position`, `goals`, `players`, `score`, and `opposite_team` remain unchanged.**
