Postcondition: ***`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is updated to (i, j) if `field[i][j]` is '.Q'. Otherwise, `quaffle_position` remains unchanged. `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` count the occurrences of 'RG' and 'BG' respectively, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`. `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`. `i` is `N`, and `j` is within the range `0` to `M-1`.***
