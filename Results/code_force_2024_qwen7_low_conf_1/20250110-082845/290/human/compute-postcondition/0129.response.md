The code `score[opposite_team] += 1` increments the score of the `opposite_team` by 1. Given that `opposite_team` is 'R', the score of team 'R' will be incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers, both odd and within the range [3, 99]; `field` is a 2D list of strings; `T` is an integer, input from the user; `actions` must have at least one element, `t` is 0; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `quaffle_position` is a tuple containing the last row and column index where `field[i][j]` is '.Q'; `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG'; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices; `score`['R'] is 1 more than its previous value; `opposite_team` is 'R'.**
