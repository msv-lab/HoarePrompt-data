Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `M` must be greater than 0.
- `quaffle_position` is the last position where `field[i][j]` is '.Q'.
- `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG', updated based on the values encountered in the loop.
- `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the values encountered in the loop.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `M-1`.

### For Loop:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(M):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `M-1`.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: Given that `j` is initially set to `M-1`, the loop will start with `j = M-1`.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `M`. Since `j` starts at `M-1`, the loop will run exactly once when `j` is `M-1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The initial value of `j` is `M-1`, and since the loop will only run if `j < M`, we need to ensure that the loop condition is met with the given initial value.
- The other variables (`M`, `quaffle_position`, `goals`, `players`, `i`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute because they are not used in the loop itself.

### Final State:
Given that the loop starts with `j = M-1` and runs exactly one time, no further adjustments to the other variables are necessary.

### Conclusion:
State: **`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is the last position where `field[i][j]` is '.Q', `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG', updated based on the values encountered in the loop, `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the values encountered in the loop, `i` is 0, and `j` is `M-1`**

This state ensures that the loop can execute exactly once as intended.
