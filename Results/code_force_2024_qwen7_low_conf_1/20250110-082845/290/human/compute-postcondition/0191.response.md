Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is the same; `j` is the same; `red_score` is the same; `blue_score` is the same; `quaffle_position` is the same; `entity` is the first element of the list `action` obtained from `data[N + 2 + t]`; `command` is the second element of the list `action` obtained from `data[N + 2 + t]`; `ball` is the same; `quaffle_carrier` is the same as `entity` if `ball` is equal to '.Q'. Otherwise, all these variables retain their original values specified in the precondition.***
