You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, which iterates over the range from 0 to `M-1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `0` to `M-1`. This means the loop will execute if `j < M`.

3. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `quaffle_position`: The last position where `field[i][j]` is '.Q'. This variable's value doesn't directly affect the loop condition but may be used within the loop.
   - `goals`: A dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG'. These values don't directly impact the loop execution.
   - `players`: A dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field. Similar to `goals`, these values do not directly affect the loop execution.
   - `i`: The initial value of `i` is given as `N`. This value is not directly relevant to the loop condition since the loop iterates over `j`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `j` must be initialized to a value less than `M`.
   - Since `j` starts at 0 (the default starting point for the `range` function), the only adjustment needed is to ensure `M` is greater than 0.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `M` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: `M` must be greater than 0**
if condition:
```
if (field[i][j] == '.Q'):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
