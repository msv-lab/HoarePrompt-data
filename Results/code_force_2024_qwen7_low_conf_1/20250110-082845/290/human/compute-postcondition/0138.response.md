The `pass` statement in Python does nothing and simply skips to the next line of code without executing any statements. Given that no operations are performed, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `scoring_team` is 'B', `quaffle_position` is ((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1), `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices, `score['R']` remains unchanged, and `opposite_team` is 'R'.**
