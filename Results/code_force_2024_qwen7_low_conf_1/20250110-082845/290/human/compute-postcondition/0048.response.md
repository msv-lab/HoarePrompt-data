The code assigns the first character of `field[i][j]` to `team` and the second character to `number`. Given that `field[i][j]` is either 'R' or 'B' followed by a digit (e.g., 'R1', 'B2'), `team` will be 'R' or 'B', and `number` will be a digit.

The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is the last position where `field[i][j]` is '.Q', `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, `i` is `N`, `j` is within the range `0` to `M-1`, `team` is 'R' or 'B', `number` is a digit.**
