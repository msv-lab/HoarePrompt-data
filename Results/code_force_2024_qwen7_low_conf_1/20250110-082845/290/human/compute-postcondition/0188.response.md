Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is the same; `j` is the same; `red_score` is the same; `blue_score` is the same; `quaffle_position` is (x, y); `entity` is the first element of the list `action` obtained from `data[N + 2 + t]`; `command` is the second element of the list `action` obtained from `data[N + 2 + t]`; `positions[entity]` is updated to [x, y] based on the command. This holds true whether `quaffle_carrier` equals `entity` or not.***
