The code `quaffle_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle_position`. Based on the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is `M-1`. Therefore, `quaffle_position` is now the tuple `(0, M-1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is (0, M-1), `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG', updated based on the values encountered in the loop, `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the values encountered in the loop, `i` is 0, and `j` is `M-1`.**
