The code reads a 2D list of strings representing the field from the input and assigns it to the variable `field`. The dimensions of the field (N and M) are already defined in the initial state, and the field is read row by row using `input().split()`.

After executing this code, the `field` variable will contain the 2D list representation of the field, and the values of `N` and `M` will remain unchanged. The rest of the variables (like the positions of players, the Quaffle, and goals) will not be affected yet since they haven't been initialized or modified by the code provided.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; `M` is an integer, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; `field` is a 2D list of strings representing the field; the field is read from the input.**
