Postcondition: ***`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` remains unchanged or becomes `N, N + 1` depending on the condition. `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` count the occurrences of 'RG' and 'BG' respectively. If `field[N][0]` is `'RG'`, `goals['RG']` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`. `i` is `N`, and `j` is `0`. If `field[N][0]` is not in ['RG', 'BG'], `players[team][number]` is updated to `N, 0`, where `team` is the value from `field[N][0][0]` and `number` is the value from `field[N][0][1]` if the condition `field[i][j][0] in ['R', 'B']` is true. If the condition is false, the variables remain in their preconditions' states.***
