Functionality: **The function processes a game simulation based on a 2D field representation. It starts by parsing the initial field configuration, including the dimensions \(N\) and \(M\), the field itself, the number of steps \(T\), and the sequence of actions. It then iterates through each action, updating the positions of players and handling Quaffle transfers. If the Quaffle reaches a goal, it updates the score for the opposing team and resets the Quaffle to the center of the field. After processing all steps, it prints the final score.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values for \(N\), \(M\), or \(T\), non-odd dimensions, or invalid actions).
- If no actions result in the Quaffle reaching a goal, the score remains zero for both teams.
- The function does not validate that the Quaffle is always within the field boundaries.
- If an invalid team or player is specified in an action, the function assumes the action is invalid and does nothing.
- The function does not account for multiple simultaneous actions affecting the same position or the same player, which could lead to undefined behavior in the current implementation.
- The function does not handle the case where a player moves out of the field boundaries, which would cause an index error in the current implementation.
- The function does not handle the case where a player attempts to throw the Quaffle to an invalid position, which could also lead to undefined behavior.
