The code assigns the value `'B'` to `opposite_team` if `scoring_team` is `'R'`, and assigns the value `'R'` to `opposite_team` if `scoring_team` is `'B'`. Given that `scoring_team` is `'B'`, `opposite_team` will be assigned the value `'R'`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `opposite_team` is 'R'.
Output State: **`t` is 2; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `opposite_team` is 'R'**
