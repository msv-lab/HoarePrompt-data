The code `goals[field[i][j]] += 1` increments the value of `goals[field[i][j]]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `field[i][2]` is used to index into the `goals` dictionary. However, since `field[i][2]` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact key being incremented. But we know that `j` is 2, so the code updates the corresponding entry in the `goals` dictionary.

The initial state also mentions that `M` must be greater than 0, which is not affected by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the updated state includes `j` being 2 and the `goals` dictionary having an incremented value at the key `field[i][2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 2; `goals[field[i][2]]` is incremented by 1**
