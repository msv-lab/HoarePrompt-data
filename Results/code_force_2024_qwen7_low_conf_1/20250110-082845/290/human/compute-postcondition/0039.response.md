According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to N-1. The loop's continuation depends on the variable `i`, which ranges from 0 to N-1. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are provided:
- `quaffle_position` is the last position where `field[i][j]` is '.Q'.
- `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG'.
- `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`.

Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be equal to `N-1`. For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to `N`, meaning the loop will check if `N` is within the valid range (which it should be since it is the end of the previous iteration).

Thus, the state adjustments needed are:
- `i` must be incremented to `N`.
- `N` remains unchanged.

State: **`quaffle_position` is the last position where `field[i][j]` is '.Q', `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, `i` is `N`**.
