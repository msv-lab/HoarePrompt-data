Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `i` is 1, `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the second character of `field[1][1]`. If the first character of `field[1][1]` is either 'R' or 'B', then `players['R'][number]` or `players['B'][number]` is (1, 1). Otherwise, `j` is now `i`, `i` is now `j`, and `team` is either 'R' or 'B'.**
