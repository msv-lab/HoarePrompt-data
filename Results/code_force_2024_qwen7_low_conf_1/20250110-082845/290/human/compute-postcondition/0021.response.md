Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `M` is greater than 0. If `field[i][j]` is '.Q', the character 'Q' is at position `[0][0]` in the `field` list. Otherwise, if `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals[field[i][j]]` is 1. If neither condition is met, `j` is now `i`, `i` is now `j`, `team` is either 'R' or 'B', and `number` is the second character of `field[i][j]`.***
