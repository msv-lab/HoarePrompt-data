The code `print(f'{t} {opposite_team.upper()} GOAL')` prints a formatted string. The variables `t` and `opposite_team` are used in this string. Since printing does not change the values of these variables, the values of `t` and `opposite_team` remain unchanged. The string printed will be `1 R GOAL`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `quaffle_position` is ((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1); `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG'; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where the position of a player from `entity` is updated according to the value of `action`; `score['R']` is 1; `opposite_team` is 'R'. A string '1 R GOAL' was printed.**
