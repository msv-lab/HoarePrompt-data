According to the given for loop statement and the conditions provided, we need to analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration and determine what changes need to occur for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 0
- `M` is greater than 0
- If `field[i][j]` is '.Q', the character 'Q' is at position `[0][0]` in the `field` list.
- Otherwise, if `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals[field[i][j]]` is 1.
- If neither condition is met, `j` is now `i`, `i` is now `j`, `team` is either 'R' or 'B', and `number` is the second character of `field[i][j]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and remain within the bounds defined by `M`.

Since `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `M` remains unchanged as it is only defined as being greater than 0, but its specific value does not change between iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `j` is 1
- `M` is still greater than 0 (unchanged)
- If `field[i][j]` is '.Q', the character 'Q' is at position `[0][1]` in the `field` list.
- Otherwise, if `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals[field[i][j]]` is 1.
- If neither condition is met, `j` will be `i`, `i` will be `j`, `team` will be either 'R' or 'B', and `number` will be the second character of `field[i][j]`.

State: **`j` is 1, `M` is greater than 0. If `field[i][j]` is '.Q', the character 'Q' is at position `[0][1]` in the `field` list. Otherwise, if `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals[field[i][j]]` is 1. If neither condition is met, `j` is now `i`, `i` is now `j`, `team` is either 'R' or 'B', and `number` is the second character of `field[i][j]`.**
