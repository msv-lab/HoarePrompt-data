According to the given code snippet, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `M-1`. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initial Condition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `N` and `j` is within the range `0` to `M-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `M`. Since the loop starts with `j = 0` and increments `j` by 1 each time, the loop continues as long as `j < M`.

3. **State Adjustment**: After each iteration, `j` increases by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.

Given these considerations, let's adjust the states:

- `i` remains `N` because the loop is iterating over `j` and `i` does not change.
- `j` will be `j + 1` in the next iteration.
- `M` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

So, the updated states are:

State: **`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` remains unchanged, `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` count the occurrences of 'RG' and 'BG' respectively, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`, `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`, `i` is `N`, and `j` is within the range `0` to `M-1` but incremented by 1.**

In summary:

State: **`M` must be greater than 0, `quaffle_position` remains unchanged, `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` count the occurrences of 'RG' and 'BG' respectively, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`, `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`, `i` is `N`, and `j` is within the range `0` to `M-1` but incremented by 1.**
