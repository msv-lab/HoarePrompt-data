Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are integers, both odd and within the range [3, 99]; `field` is a 2D list of strings; `T` is an integer, input from the user; `actions` must have at least one element, `t` is 0; `quaffle_position` is a tuple containing the last row and column index where `field[i][j]` is '.Q'; `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG'; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices. If the action is 'U', the position of player `player_num` in Team Red (`players['R'][player_num]`) is updated to (row-1, col). If the action is 'D', the column index of the player's position specified by `entity` is incremented by 1. If the action is 'L', the position of the player specified by `entity` is updated to `(row, col-1)`. For any other action, the position of the player specified by `entity` is updated according to the rules of 'R', 'C', or 'T'.***
