Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `j` is `M-1`, `T` is 0, `red_score` is either 0 or an even number, `blue_score` is either 0 or an odd number, `quaffle_carrier` is `None`, `quaffle_position` is `((N - 1) // 2, (M - 1) // 2)` if `quaffle_carrier` is `None` and `quaffle_position` is not `None`, otherwise `quaffle_position` is the last position of `.Q` after all commands.**

### Explanation:

1. **Loop Termination Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `T` times, where `T` is initially a positive integer.
   - After each iteration, `T` is decremented by 1.
   - The loop terminates when `T` reaches 0.

2. **Final Values of Variables**:
   - `i` and `j` remain unchanged throughout the loop, so they stay as `N-1` and `M-1` respectively.
   - `T` eventually reaches 0, meaning the loop has executed exactly `T` times.
   - `red_score` and `blue_score` are incremented based on the condition of the `quaffle_position` being within certain grid cells ('RG' or 'BG').
   - `quaffle_carrier` can be either a specific entity or `None` after the loop.
   - `quaffle_position` will be the last known position of `.Q` unless the conditions for scoring goals cause it to reset to the center of the field.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - If `quaffle_carrier` is `None` and `quaffle_position` is not `None`, and `quaffle_position` is in a 'RG' cell, `blue_score` increases by 1 and `quaffle_position` resets to the center.
   - If `quaffle_carrier` is `None` and `quaffle_position` is not `None`, and `quaffle_position` is in a 'BG' cell, `red_score` increases by 1 and `quaffle_position` resets to the center.
   - These actions occur at the end of each iteration of the loop until `T` reaches 0.

4. **Final Values**:
   - Since the loop terminates when `T` is 0, the final values of `red_score` and `blue_score` will be the cumulative scores over all iterations.
   - `quaffle_carrier` and `quaffle_position` will reflect the state of the game at the end of the loop.

This output state captures the final values of all relevant variables after the loop has completed its iterations.
