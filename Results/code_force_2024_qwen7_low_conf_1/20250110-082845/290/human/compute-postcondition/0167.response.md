The code `score[opposite_team] += 1` increments the value associated with `opposite_team` in the `score` dictionary by 1. Given the initial state where `opposite_team` is 'R', the value of `score['R']` is incremented by 1. Since `t` and `scoring_team` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2; `scoring_team` is 'B'; `opposite_team` is 'R'; `score['R']` is 1**
