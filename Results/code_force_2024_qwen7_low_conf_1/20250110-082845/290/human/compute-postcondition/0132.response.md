Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `scoring_team` is 'B', `quaffle_position` is ((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1), `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the total number of occurrences of 'BG', `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices, `score['R']` remains unchanged, and `opposite_team` is 'R'. This holds true regardless of whether `quaffle_position` is found in `goals` or not.***
