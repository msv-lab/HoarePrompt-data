Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `M` is greater than 0, and `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q'. If `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals[field[i][j]]` is 1. Otherwise, `j` is now `i`, `i` is now `j`, `M` is greater than 0, `team` is either 'R' or 'B', and `number` is the second character of `field[i][j]`.***
