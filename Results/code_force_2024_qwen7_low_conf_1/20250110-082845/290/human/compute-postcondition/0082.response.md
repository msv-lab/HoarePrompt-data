Postcondition: ***`M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is the last position where `field[i][j]` is not '.' or 'Q', `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` is the number of occurrences of 'RG' and `goals['BG']` is the number of occurrences of 'BG', updated based on the values encountered in the loop, `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, updated such that `players[team][number] = (0, M-1)` if `field[i][j][0]` is either 'R' or 'B', and `i` is 0, `j` is `M-1`. If `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `goals` is updated accordingly, and if `field[i][j]` is not 'RG' or 'BG', `players` is updated with the position `(0, M-1)` for the corresponding team.***
