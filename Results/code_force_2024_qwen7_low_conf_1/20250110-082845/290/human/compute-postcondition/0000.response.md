The code `N, M = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, which are split by whitespace, and assigns them to the variables `N` and `M`. This means that the values of `N` and `M` will be converted from strings to integers based on the input.

Given the initial state:
- `N` and `M` are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd.
- The field is represented as a 2D list of strings, where each string contains M characters, and the first line is a header indicating the dimensions of the field.
- The field contains up to 10 players for each team, represented by 'R0' to 'R9' for the red team and 'B0' to 'B9' for the blue team.
- There is exactly one Quaffle represented by '.Q'.
- Each team has between 1 and 5 goals, represented by 'RG' for a red goal and 'BG' for a blue goal.
- The number of steps T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.

After running the code `N, M = map(int, input().split())`, the values of `N` and `M` are updated to the integers read from the input, but the rest of the information remains unchanged.

Output State: **N and M are integers based on the input, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; the field is represented as a 2D list of strings, where each string contains M characters, and the first line is a header indicating the dimensions of the field; the field contains up to 10 players for each team, represented by 'R0' to 'R9' for the red team and 'B0' to 'B9' for the blue team; there is exactly one Quaffle represented by '.Q'; each team has between 1 and 5 goals, represented by 'RG' for a red goal and 'BG' for a blue goal; the number of steps T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.**
