Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; `M` is an integer, 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd; `field` is a 2D list of strings representing the field; `T` is an integer, input from the user; `actions` must have at least one element, `t` is 0; if the action is 'T', `quaffle_position` is now `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]`; `goals` is a dictionary where goals['RG'] is the total number of occurrences of 'RG' and goals['BG'] is the total number of occurrences of 'BG'; `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, where each position is a tuple containing the row and column indices.***
