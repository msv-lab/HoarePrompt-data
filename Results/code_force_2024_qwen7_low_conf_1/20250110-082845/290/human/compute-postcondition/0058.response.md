Postcondition: **`M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` remains unchanged, `goals` is a dictionary where `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` count the occurrences of 'RG' and 'BG' respectively, updated based on the current value of `field[i][j]`, `players` is a dictionary mapping each team ('R' or 'B') to a dictionary of player numbers to their positions in the field, now updated such that `players[team][number]` is `(i, j)` if `field[i][j][0]` is either 'R' or 'B', `i` is `N`, and `j` is `N+1`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.**
