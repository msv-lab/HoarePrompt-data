Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `M` is greater than 0. If `field[i][j]` is '.Q', then `quaffle_position` is `(i, 1)`. Otherwise, if `field[i][j]` is in ['RG', 'BG'], then `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1. If neither condition is met, then `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the second character of `field[1][1]`, and if the first character of `field[1][1]` is either 'R' or 'B', then `players['R'][number]` or `players['B'][number]` is (1, 1). Otherwise, `j` is now `i`, `i` is now `j`, and `team` is either 'R' or 'B'.***
