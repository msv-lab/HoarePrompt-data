Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is the same; `j` is the same; `red_score` is the same; `blue_score` is the same; `quaffle_position` is the same; `entity` is the first element of the list `action` obtained from `data[N + 2 + t]`; `command` is the second element of the list `action` obtained from `data[N + 2 + t]`; if `command` equals 'T', then `quaffle_carrier` is `None`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
