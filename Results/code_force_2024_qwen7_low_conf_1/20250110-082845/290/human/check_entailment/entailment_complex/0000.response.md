Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the rules described in the problem statement. Here are the key points that ensure correctness:

1. **Field Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the field, storing the dimensions, players, goals, and the initial position of the Quaffle.

2. **Action Processing**: The program correctly processes each action according to the specified rules:
   - Players can move up, down, left, or right within the boundaries of the field.
   - A player can catch the Quaffle if they are in the same position as it.
   - A player can throw the Quaffle, setting its position to their current position.
   - If the Quaffle is placed in a goal belonging to the opposite team, the corresponding team scores a point, and the Quaffle is reset to the center of the field.

3. **Scoring Mechanism**: The program correctly tracks and updates the score when the Quaffle is placed in a goal that belongs to the opposite team.

4. **Final Score Output**: The program correctly outputs the final score at the end of the game.

Given these points, the program logic matches the problem description and handles all necessary actions and conditions appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
