Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, scoring in the wrong goal (i.e., a red player scoring in a red goal or a blue player scoring in a blue goal) should result in the other team winning a point. However, the program currently only updates the score when a player scores in the opponent's goal and does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. For example, if a red player throws the Quaffle into a red goal, the program should recognize this as a mistake and award a point to the blue team, but it does not do so. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
