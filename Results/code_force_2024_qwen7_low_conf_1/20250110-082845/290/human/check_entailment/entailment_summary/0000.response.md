Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input values for the dimensions \(N\) and \(M\) of the field, the initial state of the field, the number of steps \(T\), and the sequence of actions.
2. It initializes dictionaries to keep track of the positions of players and goals.
3. For each action, the program updates the positions of players and handles the transfer of the Quaffle.
4. When the Quaffle is placed in a goal, the program correctly identifies the scoring team and updates the score for the opposing team.
5. The program prints the final score after processing all the steps.

The provided execution summary aligns with the program's logic and behavior, indicating that the program accurately simulates the game according to the rules specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
