Reasoning:
1. **Field Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the field and extracts the initial positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle. This part is handled properly.
2. **Action Processing**: The program processes each action correctly:
   - It updates the positions of players when they move.
   - It handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle appropriately.
3. **Scoring Mechanism**: The program correctly identifies when a team scores by checking if the Quaffle is placed in an opposing team's goal and updates the score accordingly. The program prints the appropriate message indicating the scoring team and the step at which the score occurred.
4. **Final Score Calculation**: After processing all actions, the program correctly prints the final score of the game.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to handle all the specified requirements correctly.

Correctness: **True**
