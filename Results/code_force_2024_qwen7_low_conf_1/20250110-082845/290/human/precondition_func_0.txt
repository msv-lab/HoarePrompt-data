N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a 2D list of strings, where each string contains M characters, and the first line is a header indicating the dimensions of the field. The field contains up to 10 players for each team, represented by 'R0' to 'R9' for the red team and 'B0' to 'B9' for the blue team. There is exactly one Quaffle represented by '.Q'. Each team has between 1 and 5 goals, represented by 'RG' for a red goal and 'BG' for a blue goal. The number of steps T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. Each step is described by a string indicating the action performed by an entity on the field, where the action can be moving ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'), catching a ball ('C' followed by the ball type), or throwing the Quaffle ('T').
