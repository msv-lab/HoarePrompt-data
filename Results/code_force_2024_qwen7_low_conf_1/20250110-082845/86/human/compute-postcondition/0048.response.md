`even.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. The value of `gap` depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is 2, then `gap` is `a[0] + n - a[1] - 1`; otherwise, `gap` is `a[2] - a[1] - 1`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `x`, and `a`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is in its initial state; `a` is in its initial state; `even` is a list containing one element which is `a[0] + n - a[1] - 1` if `x` is 2, or `a[2] - a[1] - 1` if `x` is not 2.**
