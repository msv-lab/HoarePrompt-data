Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- If \(i + 1\) is within the range `0` to `x-1`, the states remain the same.
- If \(i + 1\) is not within the range `0` to `x-1`, the loop terminates, and no further changes are needed.

### Code Snippet:
```python
next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**: The condition `if i == x - 1` checks if the current index `i` is one less than the length of the list `a`.
   - If true (`i == x - 1`), then `next_elem` is assigned the value `a[0] + n`.
   - If false (`i != x - 1`), then `next_elem` is assigned the value `a[i + 1]`.

2. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `next_elem` depends on the outcome of the condition check.
   - The values of `i`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise by the condition.

### Output State:
- If `i == x - 1`:
  - `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
  - All other variables (`i`, `x`, `a`) remain in their initial state because the condition does not modify them.

- If `i != x - 1`:
  - `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`.
  - All other variables (`i`, `x`, `a`) remain in their initial state because the condition does not modify them.

Given the condition, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **If `i == x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`; if `i != x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `a`) remain in their initial state.**
