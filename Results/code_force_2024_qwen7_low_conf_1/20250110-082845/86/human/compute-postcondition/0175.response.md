The code `y -= gap // 2` subtracts `gap // 2` from `y`. The value of `gap` is either `G + 3` in both conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Let's break down the initial state into two cases:

1. If `y < (G + 3) / 2`, then `ans` is `A + 2G + 1` and `gap` is `G + 3`.
2. Otherwise, `ans` is `ans + (G + 3)` and `gap` is `G + 3`.

In both cases, `gap` is `G + 3`.

- For the first case (`y < (G + 3) / 2`), `y` starts as `A + 2G + 1` and `gap` is `G + 3`. So, `y -= gap // 2` becomes `y = A + 2G + 1 - (G + 3) // 2`.
- For the second case (`y >= (G + 3) / 2`), `y` starts as `ans + (G + 3)` and `gap` is `G + 3`. So, `y -= gap // 2` becomes `y = ans + (G + 3) - (G + 3) // 2`.

Since `(G + 3) // 2` is an integer division, it can be calculated as follows:

- If `G` is even, `(G + 3) // 2` is `(G + 2) / 2`.
- If `G` is odd, `(G + 3) // 2` is `(G + 3) / 2`.

Therefore, the new value of `y` is updated accordingly. However, the values of `ans` and `gap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **If `y < (G + 3) / 2`, then `ans` is `A + 2G + 1`, `y` is `A + 2G + 1 - (G + 3) // 2`, and `gap` is `G + 3`; otherwise, `ans` is `ans + (G + 3)`, `y` is `ans + (G + 3) - (G + 3) // 2`, and `gap` is `G + 3`.**
