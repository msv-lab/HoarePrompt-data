`ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. Since `y` is an integer and its value is less than `gap // 2`, the value of `2 * y` is also an integer and is less than `2 * (gap // 2)`, which simplifies to `gap`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is an integer and its value is less than `gap // 2`; `ans` is increased by `2 * y`.

Output State: **`y` is an integer and its value is less than `gap // 2`; `ans` is increased by `2 * y`**
