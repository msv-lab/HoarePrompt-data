The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `y` and `ans`. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since no such structure is present in the given code, it simply ends the execution without changing the values of `y` and `ans`.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is increased by 0**
