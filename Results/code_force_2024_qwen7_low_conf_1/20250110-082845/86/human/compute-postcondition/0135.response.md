Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is [\(`gap`\)], `ans` is the final value determined by the conditions inside the loop, `y` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is \(\{n-2, x-2\}\), `t1` is \((a[x-1] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[x-1] + 2) \% n\), `next_elem` is `a[1]` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `a[0] + n`, `gap` is \(a1 - (a0 + 1)\) if `x` is not 1, otherwise \(n - 1\). If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, the function proceeds according to the if part's logic. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part in the code.***
