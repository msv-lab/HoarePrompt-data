Postcondition: ***`odd` loses one element (the current `gap` being processed); `total` remains positive; `num` remains negative; `x` remains a negative integer; `y` is 0; `even` loses one element (the current `gap` being processed); `ans` is updated to include the new `gap` value in the calculation (sum of all `gap` values in the `odd` list minus the adjustment made by the current `gap`); `ans` += 2 * y, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
