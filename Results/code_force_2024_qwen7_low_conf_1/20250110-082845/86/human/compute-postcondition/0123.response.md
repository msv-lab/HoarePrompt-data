Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `odd` and `even` are lists of three unique elements from \([n-1, x-1, 0]\) sorted in ascending order, `ans` is either \(x\) or \(x + 1\), `y` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is \(\{n-2, x-2\}\), `t1` is \((a[1] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[1] + 2) \% n\). If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is either \(x\) or \(x + 1\); otherwise, the values remain as they were before the if statement.***
