Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `odd` and `even` lists are as follows: if `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, `odd` list contains `a3 - a[2] - 1` and `gap`; otherwise, it is an empty list. If `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, `even` list is updated with the value of `gap`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `ans` is the final value determined by the conditions inside the loop, `y` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is \(\{n-2, x-2\}\), `t1` is \((a[x-1] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[x-1] + 2) \% n\), `next_elem` is `a[3]`.***
