`t2` is assigned the value of `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Given that `i` is equal to `x`, the expression becomes `(a[x] + 2) % n`. The value of `t2` depends on the value of `a[x]` modulo `n`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `i` is `x`, `n`, `x`, and `y` must be defined such that the set `st` contains unique elements from `[n-1, x-1, y-1]`, and if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1; `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`.
