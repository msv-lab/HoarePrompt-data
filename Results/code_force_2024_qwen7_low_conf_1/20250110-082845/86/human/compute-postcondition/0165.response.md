The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop or the most internal block it is within is exited. The initial values of `y` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is increased by `ans + gap`, `gap` is `(gap + 2)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
