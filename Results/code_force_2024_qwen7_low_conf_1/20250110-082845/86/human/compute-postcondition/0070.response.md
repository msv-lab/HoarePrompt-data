The code `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `odd` is not empty (though its exact content is not relevant to the variable `ans`)
- `ans` is 3
- `y` is `-gap // 2`, where `gap` is the next element in the `odd` list

Since `ans` is initially 3, and `y` is `-gap // 2`, the new value of `ans` will be `3 + 2 * (-gap // 2)`, which simplifies to `3 - gap`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `odd` is not empty, `ans` is 3 - `gap`, `y` is -(`gap // 2`)**
