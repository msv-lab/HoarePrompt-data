The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but breaks out of the loop or the most internal control structure. In this case, since there is no loop or control structure that the `break` statement is directly associated with, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `odd` is not empty; `y` is 0; `ans` is increased by `2 * y` which is 0.**
