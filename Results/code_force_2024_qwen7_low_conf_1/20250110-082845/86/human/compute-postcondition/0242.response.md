Postcondition: ***`odd` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` is greater than 1 and an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list; `total` is positive; `num` is negative; `x` is greater than 0; `even` is `[gap]` if `gap` is greater than 0 and an even number, otherwise it remains an empty list; `gap` is less than or equal to 1 or an even number greater than 0; `i` is 3; `next_elem` is `a[2]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`***

This postcondition consolidates the conditions from both the if and else parts, indicating that if `gap` is greater than 0 and an even number, `even` will be updated to contain `[gap]`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged as an empty list.
