`ans` is incremented by `gap`. The value of `y` and `next_gap` do not change because the code does not modify them. Therefore, the only updated variable is `ans`.

Output State: **`even` is a sorted list starting from the second element; if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is 0 and `ans` is the original first gap in the original list `even` minus `next_gap`; otherwise, `y` remains as `-next_gap / 2` and `ans` remains unchanged; `ans` is increased by `gap`.**
