`y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. The value of `ans` is increased by `gap`, and the value of `gap` remains unchanged. The initial value of `y` is an integer. After executing the code, `y` will be updated by subtracting `gap // 2` from its current value. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is an integer decreased by `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `gap` is unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is an integer decreased by `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `gap` is unchanged**
