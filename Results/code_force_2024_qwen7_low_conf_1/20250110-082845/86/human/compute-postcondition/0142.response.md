Postcondition: ***`i` is 1; `odd` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap > 1` and is odd, or an empty list otherwise; `even` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap > 1` and is even, or an empty list otherwise; `ans` is the final value determined by the conditions inside the loop; `y` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `st` is \(\{n-2, x-2\}\); `t1` is \((a[x-1] + 1) \% n\); `t2` is \((a[x-1] + 2) \% n\); `next_elem` is `a[2]`; `gap` is now \(a[2] - a[1] - 1\). If `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, `even` is updated to contain `[gap]` if `gap > 1` and is even, or remains an empty list otherwise. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if statement.***
