Postcondition: **`i` is in its initial state, `x` is in its initial state, `a` is in its initial state. If `gap > 1` and `gap % 2 == 1`, then `odd` is `[gap]`. Otherwise, if `gap > 0` and `gap % 2 == 0`, then `even` is `[gap]`, where `gap` is either `(a[0] + n) - a[i] - 1` if `i == x - 1` or `a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1` if `i != x - 1`. If `gap` does not satisfy the condition `gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0`, `even` remains unchanged.**
