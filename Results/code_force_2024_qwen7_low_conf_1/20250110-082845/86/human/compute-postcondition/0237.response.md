Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `odd` is a list containing [gap] if `gap` is greater than 1 and an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list.
   - `total` is positive.
   - `num` is negative.
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `even` is either `[gap]` or remains an empty list.
   - `gap` is less than or equal to 1 or an even number greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < x`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - Since `x` is greater than 0, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - `i` will be increased by 1 after each iteration.
   - `odd`, `total`, `num`, `even`, and `gap` do not change based on the loop itself; they depend on the loop body, which is omitted here.
   - Therefore, we only need to adjust `i`.

5. **Final State**:
   - After the current iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
   - To allow the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - Hence, `i` will be 1 (if it was 0), 2 (if it was 1), etc., but always less than `x`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is increased by 1.
- `i` must still be less than `x`.

So, the final state before the next iteration is:

**State: **`odd` is a list containing [gap] if `gap` is greater than 1 and an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list. `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is greater than 0, `even` is either `[gap]` or remains an empty list, `gap` is less than or equal to 1 or an even number greater than 0, `i` is 1 (or the next integer value less than `x`).**
