The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The value of `ans` was previously unspecified in the initial state, but now it is increased by 1. The other variables (`i`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `x-1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `((t1 - 1 + n) % n + 2) % n`, `ans` is increased by 1, and `n`, `x`, `y`, `st`, `t2` remain unchanged.**
