The code `y -= gap // 2` subtracts `gap // 2` from `y`. Since the value of `gap` is not specified in the initial state, let's denote it as `gap`. The value of `y` before the operation is 0. After performing the operation, `y` will be `-gap // 2`.

Other variables remain unchanged: `i` is 1, `odd` is not empty, and `ans` is 3.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `odd` is not empty, `ans` is 3, `y` is -`gap` // 2**
