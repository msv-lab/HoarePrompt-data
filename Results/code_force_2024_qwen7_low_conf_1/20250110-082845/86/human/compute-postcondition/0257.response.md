The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `y`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`odd` is an empty list, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a negative integer, `even` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `ans` is increased by `2 * y` which means `ans` is increased by 0, so `ans` remains the same.**
