`ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by the given code. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` must be defined such that the set `st` contains unique elements from `[n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `t1` is not in `st`, `t2` is in `st`, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
