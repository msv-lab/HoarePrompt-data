`ans` is incremented by the value of `gap`. The initial value of `ans` is not explicitly given but is mentioned to remain unchanged, which implies it was 0 before this line of code was executed. Therefore, after executing `ans += gap`, the value of `ans` becomes `gap`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `odd` is not empty, `ans` is `gap`**
