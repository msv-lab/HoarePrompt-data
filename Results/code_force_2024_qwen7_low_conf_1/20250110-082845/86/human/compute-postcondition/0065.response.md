The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `odd`, `ans`, and `y`. It simply breaks out of the nearest loop or match-case statement. Since there is no such construct in the given code, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `odd` is not empty, `ans` is 3 * `ans` - `gap`, `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement.**
