Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` must be defined such that the set `st` contains unique elements from `[n-1, x-1, y-1]`, and if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. There is no change in the state of the program if the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` is not met.***
