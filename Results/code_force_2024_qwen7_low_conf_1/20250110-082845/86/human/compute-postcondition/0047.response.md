The code `odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Based on the initial state, `gap` is defined as follows:

- If `x` is 2, then `gap` is `a[0] + n - a[1] - 1`.
- If `x` is not 2, then `gap` is `a[2] - a[1] - 1`.

After appending `gap` to `odd`, the values of `i`, `x`, `a`, and `gap` remain unchanged except for `odd`, which now contains the appended value.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is in its initial state; `a` is in its initial state; `gap` is `a[0] + n - a[1] - 1` if `x` is 2, or `a[2] - a[1] - 1` if `x` is not 2; `odd` is a list containing one element `gap`.**
