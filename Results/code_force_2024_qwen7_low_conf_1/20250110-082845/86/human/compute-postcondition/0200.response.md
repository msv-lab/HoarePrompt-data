Output State: **`y` is `0` if the loop breaks due to `y < gap // 2` in any iteration, or it is a negative multiple of `gap // 2` based on the number of times the loop runs; `ans` is the sum of all gaps processed plus any adjustments made when `y < gap // 2`; `i` is `x`; `odd` is a sorted list containing all gaps \( g \) such that \( g > 1 \) and is odd; `even` is a sorted list containing all gaps \( g \) such that \( g > 1 \) and is even; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `st` is \(\{n-2, x-2\}\); `t1` is \((a[x-1] + 1) \% n\); `t2` is \((a[x-1] + 2) \% n\). The value of `ans` is printed.**
