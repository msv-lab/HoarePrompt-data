Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `x` is in its initial state, `a` is in its initial state. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` is a list containing one element which is `a[0] + n - a[1] - 1` if `x` is 2, or `a[2] - a[1] - 1` if `x` is not 2. If `gap` does not meet these conditions, the state remains as `even` being an empty list.***
