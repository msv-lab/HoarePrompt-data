First, let's determine the value of `gap`. Given the initial state, `gap` is updated to `a[5] - a[4] - 1`.

Since `even` is a list that contains `[a[5] - a[4] - 1]` if `a[5] - a[4] - 1` is greater than 0 and an even number, otherwise it remains an empty list, and now we append `gap` to `even`, we need to consider the parity of `gap`.

The code `even.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. This means that `even` will now contain `gap`.

Now, let's summarize the changes:

- `even` gets appended with the value of `gap`.
- The other variables (`odd`, `total`, `num`, `x`, `even`, `gap`, `i`, `next_elem`) remain unchanged.

So, the Output State is:

**`odd` is a list containing `[a[5] - a[4] - 1]` if `a[5] - a[4] - 1` is greater than 1 and an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list; `total` is positive; `num` is negative; `x` is greater than 0; `even` is now `[gap]` (where `gap` is `a[5] - a[4] - 1`); `gap` is updated to `a[5] - a[4] - 1`; `i` is 4; `next_elem` is `a[5]`.**
