To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the provided code and the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `odd` is an empty list.
- `total` is positive.
- `num` is negative.
- `x` is negative.
- `even` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `x` iterations.
   - Since `x` is negative, the loop will not execute at all.

2. **Variables After Loop Execution**:
   - `odd`: Remains an empty list because the loop does not execute.
   - `total`: Remains positive because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `num`: Remains negative because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `x`: Remains negative because it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `even`: Remains an empty list because the loop does not execute.

### Output State:
Since the loop does not execute due to the negative value of `x`, the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`odd` is an empty list, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a negative integer, `even` is an empty list.**
