Postcondition: ***`odd` is a list of gaps that were processed, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a negative integer, `even` is a non-empty list, `y` is 0, `ans` is the sum of all `gap` values in the `odd` list minus the adjustments made by `y`. If `y < gap // 2`, `ans` remains unchanged; otherwise, the condition does not apply as there is no else part.***
