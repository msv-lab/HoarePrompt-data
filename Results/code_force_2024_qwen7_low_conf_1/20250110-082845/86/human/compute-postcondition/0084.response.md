`y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. The initial value of `y` is 0, so subtracting `gap // 2` from 0 results in `y` becoming `-gap // 2`. The values of `i`, `odd`, `even`, `ans`, and `gap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is between 0 and \( x - 1 \), `odd` and `even` are lists of three unique elements from \([n-1, x-1, 0]\) sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the current value of `gap`, `y` is -`gap // 2`**.
