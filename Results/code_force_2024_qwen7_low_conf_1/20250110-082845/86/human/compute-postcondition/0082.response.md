Postcondition: ***`i` is between 0 and \( x - 1 \), `odd` and `even` are lists of three unique elements from \([n-1, x-1, 0]\) sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the sum of all gaps in `odd` minus the sum of `gap // 2` for each gap, and `y` is 0. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, the loop or statement is broken out of. There is no change in `odd`, `even`, or `ans` under this condition.***
