To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `y` is an integer and is equal to `y - (G + 2) // 2`.
  - `ans` is `A + 2G + 2`.
  - `gap` is `G + 2`.

- Loop statement:
  ```python
  for gap in odd:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over values in the `odd` sequence. This means `gap` must be an odd number for the loop to continue executing.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `gap` is `G + 2`.

Since `gap` is currently `G + 2`, we need to determine the next value of `gap` that would satisfy the loop condition. In this case, `gap` must be the next odd number after `G + 2`.

### Determining the Next Value:
- If `G + 2` is even, the next odd number would be `(G + 2) + 1 = G + 3`.
- If `G + 2` is odd, the next odd number would be `(G + 2) + 2 = G + 4`. However, since `G + 4` is not the immediate next odd number after `G + 2`, we consider the next odd number as `G + 3`.

Therefore, the next value of `gap` for the loop to execute again should be `G + 3`.

### Adjusted States:
- `y` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop.
- `ans` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop.
- `gap` needs to be updated to the next odd number, which is `G + 3`.

### Final State:
State: **`y` is an integer and is equal to `y - (G + 2) // 2`, `ans` is `A + 2G + 2`, `gap` is `G + 3`**
