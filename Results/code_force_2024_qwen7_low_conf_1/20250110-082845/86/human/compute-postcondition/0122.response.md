`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` was either \(x - 1\) or \(x\), so now it becomes either \(x\) or \(x + 1\). The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `odd` and `even` are lists of three unique elements from \([n-1, x-1, 0]\) sorted in ascending order, `ans` is either \(x\) or \(x + 1\), `y` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is \(\{n-2, x-2\}\), `t1` is \((a[1] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[1] + 2) \% n\)**
