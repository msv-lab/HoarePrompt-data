`t2` is updated to the value of `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`. Therefore, `t2` is now `(a[1] + 2) % n`. The value of `a[1]` was previously used to calculate `t1`, which means `t1` is still valid as `(a[0] + 3) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is a set containing the elements of the list `a` where each element is one less than its original value, `t1` is `(a[0] + 3) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
