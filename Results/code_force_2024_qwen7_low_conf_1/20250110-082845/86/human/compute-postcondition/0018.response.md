Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `i` is `x`, `n`, `x`, and `y` must be defined such that the set `st` contains unique elements from `[n-1, x-1, y-1]`, and if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1; `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`. If the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` is true, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
