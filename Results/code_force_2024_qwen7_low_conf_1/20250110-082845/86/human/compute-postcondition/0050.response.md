Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `x` is in its initial state, `a` is in its initial state. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing one element `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` is a list containing one element which is `a[0] + n - a[1] - 1` if `x` is 2, or `a[2] - a[1] - 1` if `x` is not 2. If neither of these conditions is met, `even` remains an empty list.**
