The initial state is:
- `even` is a sorted list containing all gaps \( g \) such that \( g > 1 \) and is even.
- `y` is 0.
- `ans` is \(2 \times 0 + gap\), which simplifies to `ans` being the first gap in the list `even`.

The code snippet is:
```
y -= gap // 2
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The value of `gap` is taken from the list `even`.
2. `y` is initially 0, and `gap` is the first element in the list `even`.
3. The operation `y -= gap // 2` means that `y` is decreased by half of `gap`. Since `gap` is an even number (as per the precondition), `gap // 2` is simply `gap / 2` without the remainder.

After this operation, the value of `y` will be `-gap / 2`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged because no assignment to `ans` was made in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `even` is a sorted list containing all gaps \( g \) such that \( g > 1 \) and is even.
- `y` is `-gap / 2`.
- `ans` is the first gap in the list `even`.

Output State: **`even` is a sorted list containing all gaps \( g \) such that \( g > 1 \) and is even; `y` is `-gap / 2`; `ans` is the first gap in the list `even`.**
