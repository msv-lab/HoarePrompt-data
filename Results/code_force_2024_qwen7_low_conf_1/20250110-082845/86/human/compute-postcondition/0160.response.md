The code `ans += gap` increases the value of `ans` by the value of `gap`. Given the initial state, if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `ans` is increased by 0. Since the condition does not affect the value of `ans`, `ans` will be increased by the value of `gap`.

Output State: **`y` is an integer, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `gap` is unchanged**
