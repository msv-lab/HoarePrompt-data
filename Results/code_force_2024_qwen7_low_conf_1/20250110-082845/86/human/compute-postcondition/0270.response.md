`ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. Given that `y` is equal to `-gap`, the value of `ans` becomes `3 * gap + 2 * (-gap)`, which simplifies to `ans = 3 * gap - 2 * gap = gap`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`odd` must have at least two elements, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a negative integer, `even` is an empty list, `y` is `-gap`, `ans` is `gap`**
