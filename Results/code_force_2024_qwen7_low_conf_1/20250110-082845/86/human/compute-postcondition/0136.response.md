Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `odd` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap > 1` and is odd, or an empty list otherwise, `even` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap > 1` and is even, `ans` is the final value determined by the conditions inside the loop, `y` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is \(\{n-2, x-2\}\), `t1` is \((a[x-1] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[x-1] + 2) \% n\), `next_elem` is `a[1]` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `a[0] + n`, `gap` is \(a1 - (a0 + 1)\) if `x` is not 1, otherwise \(n - 1\).***
