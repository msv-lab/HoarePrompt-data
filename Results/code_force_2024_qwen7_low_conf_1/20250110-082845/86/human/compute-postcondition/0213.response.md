Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is a set containing the elements of the list `a` where each element is one less than its original value, `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0] + 3) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `st`, `t1`, `t2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
