Postcondition: ***`i` is still 1; `odd` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` (which is now \(a[2] - a[1] - 1\)) is greater than 1 and is odd, otherwise it is an empty list; `even` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` is greater than 1 and is even, otherwise it is an empty list; `ans` is the final value determined by the conditions inside the loop; `y` is still 0; `n` is still an input integer; `x` is still an input integer; `st` is still \(\{n-2, x-2\}\); `t1` is still \((a[x-1] + 1) \% n\); `t2` is still \((a[x-1] + 2) \% n\); `next_elem` is still `a[2]`. If `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, `odd` is updated to contain `[gap]`. If `gap > 1` and `gap` is even, `even` is updated to contain `[gap]` if `gap` is even.***
