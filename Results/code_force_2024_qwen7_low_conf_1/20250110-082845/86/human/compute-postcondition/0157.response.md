The code sets `y` to 0. Initially, `y` is an integer with a value less than `gap // 2`. After executing `y = 0`, `y` is now 0. The value of `ans` was increased by `2 * y` previously, meaning `ans` was increased by 0 (since `2 * 0 = 0`). Thus, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is increased by 0**
