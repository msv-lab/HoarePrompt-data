The code `odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Since the initial state of `odd` is not specified (it is assumed to be an empty list), it means that before the code is executed, `odd` is an empty list. After executing `odd.append(gap)`, `odd` will contain the value of `gap`.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `i == x - 1`, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` and `gap` is `(a[0] + n) - a[i] - 1`.
- If `i != x - 1`, then `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]` and `gap` is `a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1`.
- `i` is in its initial state.
- `x` is in its initial state.
- `a` is in its initial state.

Since the exact values of `i`, `x`, `a`, and `n` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `gap`. However, we know that `odd` is now a list containing one element, which is `gap`.

Output State: **`odd` is `[gap]`, `i` is in its initial state, `x` is in its initial state, `a` is in its initial state.**
