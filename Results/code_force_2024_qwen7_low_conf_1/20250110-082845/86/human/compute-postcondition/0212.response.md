`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` was 0 before the execution of this line, so now `ans` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is a set containing the elements of the list `a` where each element is one less than its original value, `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0] + 3) % n`, `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`; `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is a set containing the elements of the list `a` where each element is one less than its original value, `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0] + 3) % n`, `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`; `ans` is 1.**
