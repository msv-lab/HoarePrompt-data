State before the loop starts: `t` is the integer input value (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the conditions for `n`, `x`, and `y` are yet to be defined.
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break it down:

1. **Variable `t`:** The variable `t` is given as an integer input value with the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within this range.

2. **Variables `n`, `x`, and `y`:** The problem states that the conditions for `n`, `x`, and `y` are yet to be defined. Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot infer specific conditions for these variables from the provided code snippet. However, typically, for such loops, `n`, `x`, and `y` should be defined or initialized before the loop starts to ensure valid operations within the loop body. Without specific constraints provided, we assume they must be defined and initialized appropriately.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute are:

- `t` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `x`, and `y` must be defined and initialized appropriately for their use within the loop body.

State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `x`, and `y` are defined and initialized appropriately**
