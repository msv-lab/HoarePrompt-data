According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `odd` list. The loop can execute again if there are still elements left in the `odd` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `i` is 1
- `odd` is not empty
- `ans` is 3
- `y` is -(`gap // 2`)
- We broke out of the most internal loop or match-case statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, `odd` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `odd` is not empty and that the loop can proceed to the next value of `gap`.

State: **`i` is 1, `odd` is not empty, `ans` is 3, `y` is -(`gap // 2`), and `gap` is the next element in the `odd` list**
