`y` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `y` was previously calculated as `ans - gap // 2`, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `odd` is not empty, `ans` is 3 * `ans` - `gap`, `y` is `0`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `odd` is not empty, `ans` is 3 * `ans` - `gap`, `y` is 0**
