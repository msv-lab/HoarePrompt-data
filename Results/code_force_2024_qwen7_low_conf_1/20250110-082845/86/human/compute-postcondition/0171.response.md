The initial state is defined such that `y` is equal to `y - (G + 2) // 2`, `ans` is `A + G + 2y - 2`, and `gap` is `G + 3`. The code snippet assigns `0` to `y`.

- The initial value of `y` is `y - (G + 2) // 2`.
- After executing `y = 0`, the new value of `y` is `0`.
- The value of `ans` is dependent on `A`, `G`, and the previous value of `y`, which was `y - (G + 2) // 2`. However, since `y` is now `0`, the expression for `ans` simplifies to `ans = A + G + 2*0 - 2 = A + G - 2`.
- The value of `gap` remains unchanged and is still `G + 3`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `y` is `0`.
- `ans` is `A + G - 2`.
- `gap` is `G + 3`.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is `A + G - 2`, `gap` is `G + 3`**
