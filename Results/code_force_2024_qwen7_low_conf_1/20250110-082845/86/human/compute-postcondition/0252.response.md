The `sort()` method is used to sort the elements in the list in ascending order. Since `odd` is an empty list, calling `sort()` on it does not change its contents. The states of the other variables (`total`, `num`, `x`, and `even`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`odd` is an empty list, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a negative integer, `even` is an empty list.**
