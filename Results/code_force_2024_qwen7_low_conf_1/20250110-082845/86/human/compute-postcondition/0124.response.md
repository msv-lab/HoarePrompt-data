Output State: **`i` is \( x \), `odd` and `even` are lists of three unique elements from \([n-1, x-1, 0]\) sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the final value determined by the conditions inside the loop, `y` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is \(\{n-2, x-2\}\), `t1` is \((a[x-1] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[x-1] + 2) \% n\)**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for each value of `i` from 0 to \( x - 1 \).
- For each iteration, `t1` and `t2` are calculated based on the current value of `a[i]`.
- The condition `if t1 not in st and t2 in st:` is checked, and if true, `ans` is incremented.
- After all iterations, `i` will be \( x \) because the loop runs \( x \) times.
- The final value of `ans` depends on whether the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st:` was met for each `i`.
- The variables `odd` and `even` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- `y`, `n`, `x`, `st`, `t1`, and `t2` retain their final values after the last iteration.
