`y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. Since `gap` is equal to `G + 2`, `gap // 2` is `(G + 2) // 2`. Therefore, `y` becomes `y - (G + 2) // 2`. The other variables (`ans` and `gap`) are not affected.

Output State: **`y` is an integer and is equal to `y - (G + 2) // 2`, `ans` is `A + 2G + 2`, `gap` is `G + 2`**
