`ans` is assigned the value `x - 2`. The value of `x` is an integer from the input, so `ans` will be `x - 2`. The values of `t`, `a`, `n`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list containing the values `[n-1, x-1, y-1]; `ans` is `x - 2`; `n` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer.**
