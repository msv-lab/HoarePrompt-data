Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is in its initial state (likely 0).
   - `x` is in its initial state (likely some non-negative integer).
   - `a` is in its initial state (likely a list or array).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(x):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < x`.
   - At the end of each iteration, `i` increases by 1.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged.
- The values of `a` and `x` are assumed to be in their initial states since no changes were made during the iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `x` is in its initial state, `a` is in its initial state**.
