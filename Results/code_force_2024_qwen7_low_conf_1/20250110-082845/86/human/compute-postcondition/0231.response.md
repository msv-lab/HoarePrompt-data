The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Since `gap` is currently an odd number greater than 1, it will be added to the `odd` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` is [gap], `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is greater than 0, `even` is an empty list, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1` and is greater than 1 and is an odd number**
