`ans` is incremented by `gap`. The initial value of `ans` is `3 - gap`, so after the increment, `ans` becomes `3 - gap + gap`, which simplifies to `3`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `odd` is not empty, `ans` is 3, `y` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement.**
