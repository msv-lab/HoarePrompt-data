Postcondition: ***`i` is between 0 and \( x - 1 \), `odd` and `even` are lists of three unique elements from \([n-1, x-1, 0]\) sorted in ascending order, `ans` is either \( x - 2 \) or \( x - 1 \) depending on the condition of `t1` and `t2`, `y` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is \(\{n-2, x-2\}\), `t1` is undefined, `t2` is undefined***

Explanation:
- If `t1 not in st and t2 in st` is true, then `ans` becomes \( x - 1 \).
- If the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` is false, then `ans` remains \( x - 2 \).

Since the else part does not change any variables, the overall postcondition is determined solely by the if part.
