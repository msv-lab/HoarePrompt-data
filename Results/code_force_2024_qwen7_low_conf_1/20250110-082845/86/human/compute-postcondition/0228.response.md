The given code snippet does not actually assign a value to any variable. It defines a condition for assigning a value to `next_elem`, but does not execute the assignment due to the lack of context (such as defining `a`, `i`, and `n`). Therefore, no variables are updated or affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`odd` is an empty list, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is greater than 0, `even` is an empty list**
