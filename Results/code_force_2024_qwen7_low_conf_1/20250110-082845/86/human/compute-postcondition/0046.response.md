The code calculates `gap` as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. The value of `i` is 1, and `next_elem` is defined based on the value of `x`. Since the value of `x` is not specified, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `x` is 2, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
2. If `x` is not 2, then `next_elem` is `a[2]`.

Let's consider both cases:

### Case 1: `x` is 2
- `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
- `gap` becomes `(a[0] + n) - a[1] - 1 = a[0] + n - a[1] - 1`.

### Case 2: `x` is not 2
- `next_elem` is `a[2]`.
- `gap` becomes `a[2] - a[1] - 1`.

Since the value of `x` is not specified, we need to express `gap` in terms of `x`:
- If `x` is 2, then `gap` is `a[0] + n - a[1] - 1`.
- If `x` is not 2, then `gap` is `a[2] - a[1] - 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is in its initial state; `a` is in its initial state; `gap` is `a[0] + n - a[1] - 1` if `x` is 2, or `a[2] - a[1] - 1` if `x` is not 2.**
