The code `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to it. Given that `y` is updated to `-new_gap // 2` in the previous step, we can express `ans` as `ans` plus `2 * (-new_gap // 2)`, which simplifies to `ans - new_gap`.

Since the exact value of `new_gap` is not specified, we will keep it as `new_gap` in our output state. The other variables (`i`, `odd`, `even`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` remains within the same range (0 to \( x - 1 \)); `odd` and `even` remain the same; `ans` is updated by subtracting `new_gap`; `y` is updated to `-new_gap // 2`.**
