The code `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to it. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `odd` is not empty
- `ans` is the next `gap` in the list
- `y` is its initial value minus the new `gap // 2`

Let's calculate the new value of `ans`:

1. The value of `y` is `ans - gap // 2`.
2. The new value of `ans` will be `ans + 2 * (ans - gap // 2) = ans + 2 * ans - gap`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `3 * ans - gap`.

The other variables (`i`, `odd`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `odd` is not empty, `ans` is 3 * `ans` - `gap', `y` is `ans` - `gap // 2**
