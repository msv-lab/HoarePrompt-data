`ans` is incremented by `gap`. The value of `y` remains `0`, `i` remains within the same range (0 to \( x - 1 \)), `odd` and `even` remain the same, and `next_gap` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `ans + gap`.

Output State: **`i` remains within the same range (0 to \( x - 1 \)), `odd` and `even` remain the same, `ans` is updated to `ans + gap`, `y` is 0**
