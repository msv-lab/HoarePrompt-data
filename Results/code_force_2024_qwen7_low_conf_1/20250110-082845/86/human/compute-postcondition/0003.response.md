The code reads multiple integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to a list `a`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are not lost, but now `a` is a list containing the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` as integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list containing the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` as integers; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integer values from the input.**
