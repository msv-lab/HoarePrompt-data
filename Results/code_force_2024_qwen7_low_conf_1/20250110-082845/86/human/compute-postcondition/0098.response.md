`y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. The value of `y` was initially 0, so after the subtraction, `y` will be `-gap // 2`. The other variables (`i`, `odd`, `even`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` remains within the same range (0 to \( x - 1 \)), `odd` and `even` remain the same, `ans` is updated to `ans + gap`, `y` is -`gap // 2**.
