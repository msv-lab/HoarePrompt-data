Postcondition: ***`even` is a sorted list containing all gaps \( g \) such that \( g > 1 \) and is even, and has at least one element; `y` is 0; `ans` is updated by \(2 \times y\). Since the condition `y < gap // 2` does not provide additional information about `even`, the list remains unchanged, and `y` and `ans` are as described in the if part.***
