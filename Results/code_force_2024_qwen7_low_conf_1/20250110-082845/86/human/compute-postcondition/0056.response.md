`ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. The value of `y` is less than `gap // 2`, but since `y` itself is not defined in terms of `gap`, we keep it as is. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `odd` is not empty, `y` is a value such that `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`**
