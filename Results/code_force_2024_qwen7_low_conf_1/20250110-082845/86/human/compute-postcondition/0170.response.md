`y` is updated to `y - (G + 2) // 2`. The value of `ans` is initially `A + 2G + 2`, and `gap` is `G + 3`. Now, `ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. Since `y` is already defined as `y - (G + 2) // 2`, we substitute this into the expression for `ans`.

So, `ans` becomes:
\[ ans = A + 2G + 2 + 2 \times (y - (G + 2) // 2) \]

Since `y` is defined as `y - (G + 2) // 2`, it means `y` was previously `y - (G + 2) // 2`. We can simplify the expression for `ans`:
\[ ans = A + 2G + 2 + 2 \times (y - (G + 2) // 2) \]
\[ ans = A + 2G + 2 + 2y - 2 \times ((G + 2) // 2) \]
\[ ans = A + 2G + 2 + 2y - (G + 2) \]
\[ ans = A + G + 2y - 2 \]

Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is equal to `y - (G + 2) // 2`, `ans` is `A + G + 2y - 2`, and `gap` is `G + 3`.
Output State: **`y` is equal to `y - (G + 2) // 2`, `ans` is `A + G + 2y - 2`, `gap` is `G + 3`**
