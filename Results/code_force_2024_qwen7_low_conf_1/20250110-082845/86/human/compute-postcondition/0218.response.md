Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is a set containing the elements of the list `a` where each element is one less than its original value, `t1` is `(a[0] + 3) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
