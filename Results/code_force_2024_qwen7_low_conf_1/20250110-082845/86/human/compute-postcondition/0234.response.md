The code `even.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. Since `gap` is even and greater than 0, the value of `even` will be `[gap]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`odd` is an empty list, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is greater than 0, `even` is [gap], `gap` is even and greater than 0**
