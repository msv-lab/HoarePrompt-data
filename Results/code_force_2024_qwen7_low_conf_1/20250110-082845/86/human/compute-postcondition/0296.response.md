Postcondition: ***`odd` loses one element (the current `gap` being processed); `total` remains positive; `num` remains negative; `x` remains a negative integer; `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`; `even` must contain at least one element (the next `gap` to process); `ans` is updated to include the new `gap` value in the calculation (sum of all `gap` values in the `odd` list minus the adjustment made by the current `gap`) + the current `gap` value; if `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0 and `ans` is updated to the original `ans` plus `2 * y`. Otherwise, `ans` remains as the updated value from the if part.***
