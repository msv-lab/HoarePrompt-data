`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This means `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, and the conditions for `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) are respected. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input value (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the conditions for `n`, `x`, and `y` are yet to be defined.**
