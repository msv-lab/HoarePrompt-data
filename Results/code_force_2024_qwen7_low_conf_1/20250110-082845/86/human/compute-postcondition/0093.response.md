The code `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Based on the initial state, the value of `y` is either decreased by `next_gap // 2` if `y > next_gap // 2`, or set to `-new_next_gap // 2`. Since the exact value of `y` is not specified, we'll consider both cases.

- If `y > next_gap // 2`, then `y` is decreased by `next_gap // 2`.
- If `y <= next_gap // 2`, then `y` is set to `-new_next_gap // 2`.

In both cases, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `2 * y` to its current value. The states of the other variables (`i`, `odd`, `even`, `next_gap`, `new_next_gap`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` remains within the same range (0 to \( x - 1 \)), `odd` and `even` remain the same, `ans` is updated by adding `2 * y`, `y` is decreased by `next_gap // 2 if y > next_gap // 2, otherwise y is set to -new_next_gap // 2**
