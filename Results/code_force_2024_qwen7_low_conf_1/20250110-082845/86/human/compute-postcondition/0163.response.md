`ans` is increased by `2 * y`. Given that `y` is an integer decreased by `(gap + 2) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(gap + 2)`, the value of `y` is `y = (gap + 2) // 2 - 1`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + 2 * ((gap + 2) // 2 - 1)`. Let's simplify this expression:

\[ ans = ans + 2 \left( \frac{gap + 2}{2} - 1 \right) = ans + (gap + 2) - 2 = ans + gap \]

So, the updated value of `ans` is `ans + gap`.

The states of the other variables (`y` and `gap`) are not affected.

Output State: **`y` is an integer decreased by `(gap + 2) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `ans + gap`, `gap` is `(gap + 2)`**
