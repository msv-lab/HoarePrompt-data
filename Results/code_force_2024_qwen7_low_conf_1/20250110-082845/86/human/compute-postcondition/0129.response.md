The code initializes `gap` by subtracting `a[i] + 1` from `next_elem`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, `next_elem` is defined as `a[1]` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `a[0] + n`, and `a[i]` is `a[0]` (since `i` is 0). 

Since the exact values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` are not specified, let's denote them as `a0` and `a1` respectively. The calculation for `gap` is:

\[ \text{gap} = \text{next\_elem} - (\text{a}[0] + 1) \]

Depending on the value of `x`, `next_elem` can be `a1` or `a0 + n`. So, the `gap` can be calculated as:

1. If `x` is not 1, `next_elem = a1`, thus:
\[ \text{gap} = a1 - (a0 + 1) \]

2. If `x` is 1, `next_elem = a0 + n`, thus:
\[ \text{gap} = (a0 + n) - (a0 + 1) = n - 1 \]

In both cases, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is [], `ans` is the final value determined by the conditions inside the loop, `y` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `st` is \(\{n-2, x-2\}\), `t1` is \((a[x-1] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[x-1] + 2) \% n\), `next_elem` is `a[1]` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `a[0] + n`, `gap` is \(a1 - (a0 + 1)\) if `x` is not 1, otherwise \(n - 1\)**.
