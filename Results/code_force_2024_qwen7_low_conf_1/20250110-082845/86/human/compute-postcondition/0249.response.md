Postcondition: ***`odd` is a list containing `[a[5] - a[4] - 1]` if `a[5] - a[4] - 1` is greater than 1 and an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list; `total` is positive; `num` is negative; `x` is greater than 0; `even` is `[gap]` (where `gap` is `a[5] - a[4] - 1` if `gap` is greater than 0 and an even number, otherwise it remains an empty list); `gap` is updated to `a[5] - a[4] - 1`; `i` is 4; `next_elem` is `a[5]`.***
