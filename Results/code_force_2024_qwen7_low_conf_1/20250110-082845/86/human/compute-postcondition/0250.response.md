Postcondition: ***`odd` is a list containing `[a[5] - a[4] - 1]` if `a[5] - a[4] - 1` is greater than 1 and an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list; `total` is positive; `num` is negative; `x` is greater than 0; `even` is `[a[5] - a[4] - 1]` if `a[5] - a[4] - 1` is greater than 0 and an even number, otherwise it remains an empty list; `gap` is updated to `a[5] - a[4] - 1`; `i` is 4; `next_elem` is `a[5]`. If `gap > 1` and `gap` is an odd number, `odd` contains `a[5] - a[4] - 1`. Otherwise, `odd` remains unchanged, `even` becomes `[a[5] - a[4] - 1]` if `gap` is an even number greater than 0, and `gap` is updated to `a[5] - a[4] - 1`.***
