Postcondition: **`i` is between 0 and \( x - 1 \), `odd` and `even` are lists of three unique elements from \([n-1, x-1, 0]\) sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the sum of all gaps in `odd` minus the sum of `gap // 2` for each gap, `y` is 0, `even` must contain at least one element, and the current value of \( y \) is less than `gap // 2`**
