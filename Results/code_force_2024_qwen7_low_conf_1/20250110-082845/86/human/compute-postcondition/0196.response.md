Postcondition: **`even` is a sorted list starting from the second element, `y` is reduced by `next_gap // 2`, if `y` was originally less than `next_gap // 2`, then `ans` is the original first gap minus `next_gap`, otherwise `ans` is `ans + next_gap`, and `gap` is the next element in the `even` list; if `y < gap // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
