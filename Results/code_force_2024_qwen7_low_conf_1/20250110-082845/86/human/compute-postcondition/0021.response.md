`t2` is assigned the value `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Given that `i` is `x-1`, `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[x-1]`. From the initial state, we know `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`. Therefore, `a[x-1]` can be expressed as `(t1 - 1 + n) % n` to ensure it remains within modulo `n`.

So, substituting `a[x-1]` in the expression for `t2`, we get:
\[ t2 = ((t1 - 1 + n) % n + 2) % n \]

Since `t1` is known, we can simplify this expression further. However, without a specific value for `t1`, we keep it in this form.

Output State: **`i` is `x-1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `((t1 - 1 + n) % n + 2) % n`, and `n`, `x`, `y`, `st`, `t2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
