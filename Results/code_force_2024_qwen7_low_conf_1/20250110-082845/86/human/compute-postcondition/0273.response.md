Postcondition: ***`odd` must have at least two elements, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a negative integer, `even` is an empty list. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is set to `gap` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains `3 * gap`.***
