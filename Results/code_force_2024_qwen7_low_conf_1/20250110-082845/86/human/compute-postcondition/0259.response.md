Postcondition: ***`odd` is an empty list, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a negative integer, `even` is an empty list, `y` is 0, and `ans` remains unchanged (increased by 0). This is because the condition `y < gap // 2` does not affect any of the variables, and since there is no else part, the state remains as the precondition unless `y` is updated to 0 within the if part.***
