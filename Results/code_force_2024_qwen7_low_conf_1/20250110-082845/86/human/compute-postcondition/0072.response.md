The code `break` does not affect any variable values but breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `odd` is not empty, `ans` is 3 - `gap`, `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
