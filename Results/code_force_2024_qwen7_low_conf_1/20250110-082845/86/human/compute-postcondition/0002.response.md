The code `n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads three integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n`, `x`, and `y` are defined and initialized appropriately.

After executing the code, the input values are converted to integers and assigned to `n`, `x`, and `y`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as no operation affects it.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are now integer values obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `x`, and `y` are integer values from the input.**
