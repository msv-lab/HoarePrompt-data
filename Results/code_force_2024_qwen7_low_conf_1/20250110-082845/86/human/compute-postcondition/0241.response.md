The code `even.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. According to the initial state, `gap` is less than or equal to 1 or an even number greater than 0. Since `even` is initially either `[gap]` or an empty list, appending `gap` to `even` means `even` will now be `[gap]` if it was previously empty, or it will contain the current value of `gap` in addition to its previous elements.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`odd` is a list containing [gap] if `gap` is greater than 1 and an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list; `total` is positive; `num` is negative; `x` is greater than 0; `even` is now `[gap]`; `gap` is less than or equal to 1 or an even number greater than 0; `i` is 3; `next_elem` is `a[2]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**
