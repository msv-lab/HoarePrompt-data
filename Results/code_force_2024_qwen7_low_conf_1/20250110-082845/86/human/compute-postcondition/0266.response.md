Postcondition: ***`odd` must have at least one element, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a negative integer, `even` is an empty list, `y` is `-gap // 2` where `gap` is the first element of the `odd` list, `ans` is increased by `gap`. If `y < gap // 2`, `ans` is further increased by `gap - odd[0]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.***
