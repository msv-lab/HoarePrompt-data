t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. Additionally, there are x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and these integers appear exactly once per test case. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
