You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: [Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. Additionally, there are x distinct integers from 1 to n on the second line of each test case, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
        
        ans = x - 2
        
        st = set(a)
        
        a.sort()
        
        for i in range(x):
            t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
            t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
            if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
                ans += 1
        
        odd = []
        
        even = []
        
        for i in range(x):
            next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
            gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
            if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
                odd.append(gap)
            elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
                even.append(gap)
        
        odd.sort()
        
        even.sort()
        
        for gap in odd:
            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap
            y -= gap // 2
        
        for gap in even:
            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap
            y -= gap // 2
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the sum of all gaps in the `odd` list minus the sum of `gap // 2` for each gap, plus any additional increments due to the `2 * y` condition, up to the point where `y < gap // 2` for the last `gap` processed, and `y` is 0. `odd` and `even` are sorted lists of gaps, `n`, `x`, and `t` are the input values, `st` is the set created from the last list `a`, `t1` and `t2` are the last computed values for the last element in `a` during the last iteration.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
