Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) as well as the list of \( x \) chosen vertices.
2. **Vertex Adjustment**: It adjusts the chosen vertices by subtracting 1 to fit 0-based indexing.
3. **Initial Triangles Calculation**: It calculates the initial number of triangles as \( x - 2 \) since any \( x \) vertices can form at most \( x - 2 \) triangles.
4. **Set and Sorting**: It converts the list of chosen vertices into a set for quick lookup and sorts the list to facilitate the gap calculation.
5. **Gap Analysis**: 
   - It iterates through the sorted list to find gaps between consecutive vertices and categorizes them into odd and even gaps.
   - For odd gaps, it attempts to use up to half of the remaining \( y \) to form triangles, updating \( ans \) and reducing \( y \).
   - For even gaps, it does the same.
6. **Output**: It correctly prints the maximum number of triangles for each test case.

Given the steps outlined above, the logic appears to align with the problem's requirements. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by leveraging the gaps between chosen vertices and the available choices \( y \).

Correctness: **True**
