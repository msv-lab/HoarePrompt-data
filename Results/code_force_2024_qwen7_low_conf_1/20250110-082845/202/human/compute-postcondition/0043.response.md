Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial Variables and Conditions:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is equal to `k`.
   - `mx` is either `mx` if `mx` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it is `k` if `mx` is less than `k`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider how `cur` and `mx` change during the loop.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know exactly what happens inside the loop, but generally, `cur` and `mx` might be updated based on the current character `c`.

4. **Analyze the Possible Changes:**
   - `cur` will typically be updated based on the current character `c`. It could be incremented, decremented, or remain unchanged depending on the logic inside the loop.
   - `mx` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and `cur` if the condition inside the loop allows it.

5. **Consider the General Case:**
   - Without specific details on the loop body, we can assume the simplest case where `cur` is updated based on `c`, and `mx` is updated to the max of itself and `cur`.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `cur` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, `cur` will now be updated to a new value based on the next character `c` in the string `s`.
   - `mx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the new `cur`.

Given this reasoning, let's assume the simplest possible update for `cur` and `mx`:

- `cur` will be updated to a new value based on `c`.
- `mx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the new `cur`.

Since the exact update is not specified, we'll consider a general case where `cur` could be any value and `mx` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`cur` is a new value based on `c`, `mx` is the maximum of its current value and the new `cur`**.

To provide a concrete example, if we assume `c` updates `cur` to a new value, say `new_cur`, then:

State: **`cur` is `new_cur`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `new_cur`**.

For simplicity, let's assume `c` increments `cur` by 1 (this is just an assumption for illustration):

State: **`cur` is `k + 1`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `k + 1`**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`cur` is `k + 1`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `k + 1`**.
