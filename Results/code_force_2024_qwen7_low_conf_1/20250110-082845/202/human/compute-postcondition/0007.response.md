According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character `c` in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must have at least one character. The initial values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `mn`, `mx`, `cur`) do not directly impact whether the loop can execute, as they are initialized independently.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **String `s`:** The loop will iterate over each character in `s`. Therefore, `s` must have at least one character for the loop to execute.
2. **Other Variables:** 
   - `t` is already stated to be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `mn` and `mx` are initialized to 0.
   - `cur` is initialized to 0.
   
Since these variables' initial values do not affect the condition for the loop to execute, no adjustments are needed for them.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
State: **`s` must have at least one character**
