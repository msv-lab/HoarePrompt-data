`cur` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur_initial` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`mx`, `mn`) also remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `cur` is now `cur_initial + 2`.

Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur_initial`, `mn` is the minimum of `mn_initial` and `cur_initial`, `cur` is `cur_initial + 2`**
