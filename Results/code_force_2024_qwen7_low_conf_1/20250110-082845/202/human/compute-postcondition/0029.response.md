Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States
- `mn` is the minimum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution.
- `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution.
- `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`.
- The output is `mx - mn`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
The for loop iterates `t` times. The loop body processes some operation (which we don't know exactly) on `cur` for each iteration. The loop does not change `mn`, `mx`, or `cur` directly but updates these values based on the processed `cur` value during each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States
1. **Initial Values**: We need to determine the values of `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` after the previous iteration.
   - Let's assume the values from the previous iteration as follows:
     - `mn` is the minimum value `cur` took during the previous iterations.
     - `mx` is the maximum value `cur` took during the previous iterations.
     - `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`.

2. **For the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments the index from 0 to `t-1`, the next iteration will process the `(t-1)`-th element.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue to process `cur` for one more time.
   - `mn` and `mx` will be updated based on the new value of `cur` in this iteration.
   - `cur` itself will be updated based on the loop body operations.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - `mn` remains the same as it is the minimum value of `cur` from the previous iterations and will be updated only if a new minimum is found.
   - `mx` remains the same as it is the maximum value of `cur` from the previous iterations and will be updated only if a new maximum is found.
   - `cur` will be updated based on the current iteration.

### Final State After One More Iteration
- The loop will execute one more time.
- `mn` will remain the same unless a new minimum is found.
- `mx` will remain the same unless a new maximum is found.
- `cur` will be updated based on the loop body operations.

Given that we do not have specific details about the loop body, we can generalize the answer as:

State: **`mn` is the minimum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `cur` is the updated value of `cur` after processing the next character in `s`, the output is `mx - mn`**.
