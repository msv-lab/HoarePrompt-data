Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character remaining, `mn` remains unchanged, `mx` is 2 if `mx_initial` was less than 2, otherwise `mx` remains `mx_initial`, `cur` changes as follows: if `cur` was initially 1, it becomes 3; if `cur` was initially -1, it becomes 1; if `cur` was initially 2, it becomes 1; if `cur` was initially 0, it becomes -1.***
