`cur` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `cur` is `cur_initial + 1`. Therefore, after executing `cur = cur - 1`, the new value of `cur` is `cur_initial`.

The states of the other variables (`mx`, `mn`, and `cur_initial`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur_initial`, `mn` is the minimum of `mn_initial` and `cur_initial`, `cur` is `cur_initial`**
