The code initializes `mn` to 0. The values of `mx`, `cur`, `n`, and the output (which is `mx - mn`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the only affected variable is `mn`, which is now set to 0.

Output State: **`mn` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `cur` is the updated value of `cur` after processing the next character in `s`, `n` is an input integer, and the output is `mx - mn`**
