Output State: **`cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` during the loop, `mn` and `mx` are derived from the values of `cur` for each character in `s`.** 

To break this down further:
- The loop processes each character in the string `s`.
- For each character `c`, the value of `cur` is adjusted based on whether `cur` is even and `c` is '1', or `cur` is odd and `c` is '0'.
- `mn` is updated to be the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
- `mx` is updated to be the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.

Since the loop processes all characters in `s`, `cur` will end up with its final value after processing the entire string. `mx` and `mn` will hold the highest and lowest values that `cur` took during the loop execution, respectively.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `s` is an empty string), the initial values of `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` remain as they were initially set: `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, and `cur` is 0. Thus, `mx - mn` is still 0.
