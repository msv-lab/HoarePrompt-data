According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because the range function in Python starts from 0. Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), we need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

The other variables (`n` and `s`) do not directly influence the ability of the loop to execute. The only requirement for the loop to start is that `t` must be a non-zero value.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `s` is a binary string of length n**
