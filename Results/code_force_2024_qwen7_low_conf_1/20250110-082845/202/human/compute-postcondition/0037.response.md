The code increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given that the initial value of `cur % 2` is equal to the initial value of `(c == '1')`, we can determine the updated value of `cur` based on whether `c` is '1' or not.

- If `c` is '1', then initially `cur % 2` would be 1 (since '1' is truthy), which means `cur` was odd.
- After incrementing `cur` by 1, `cur` will now be even.

- If `c` is not '1', then initially `cur % 2` would be 0 (since '0' is falsy), which means `cur` was even.
- After incrementing `cur` by 1, `cur` will now be odd.

Therefore, the updated value of `cur` depends on its initial parity, which is determined by the value of `c`.

Output State: **`s` must be a non-empty string, `cur` is now an integer with a value that is one more than its previous value, `c` is a character, the current value of `cur % 2` is equal to the current value of `(c == '1') + 1 % 2`**
