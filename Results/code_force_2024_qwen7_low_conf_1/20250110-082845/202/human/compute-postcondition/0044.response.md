The code `cur = cur + 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial state where `cur` is `k + 1`, after the code execution, `cur` will become `(k + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `k + 2`. The value of `mx` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `mx`.

Output State: **`cur` is `k + 2`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `k + 1`**
