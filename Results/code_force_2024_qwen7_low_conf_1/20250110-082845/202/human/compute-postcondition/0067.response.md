The code `cur = cur - 1` decrements the value of `cur` by 1. Given that the initial state of `cur` is 0, after executing this line, `cur` will become `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is -1, and `(cur % 2 == 0)` is not equal to (`c == '1'`)**
