You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and s is a binary string of length n.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        mn = 0
        
        mx = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        for c in s:
            if (cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1'):
                cur = cur + 1
            else:
                cur = cur - 1
            mn = min(mn, cur)
            mx = max(mx, cur)
        
        print(mx - mn)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the provided code and initial conditions.
    #
    #### Initial State
    #- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
    #- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
    #- `s` is a binary string of length `n`.
    #
    #### Loop Code Analysis
    #```python
    #for _ in range(t):
    #    n = int(input())  # User inputs `n`
    #    s = input()       # User inputs `s` (a binary string of length `n`)
    #    mn = 0            # Initialize `mn` to 0
    #    mx = 0            # Initialize `mx` to 0
    #    cur = 0           # Initialize `cur` to 0
    #    for c in s:       # Iterate over each character in `s`
    #        if (cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1'):
    #            cur = cur + 1
    #        else:
    #            cur = cur - 1
    #        mn = min(mn, cur)  # Update `mn` to the minimum value of `cur`
    #        mx = max(mx, cur)  # Update `mx` to the maximum value of `cur`
    #    print(mx - mn)     # Print the difference `mx - mn`
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #1. **Loop Execution Summary:**
    #   - For each iteration of the outer loop (`_ in range(t)`), the inner loop processes the string `s`.
    #   - The variable `cur` keeps track of the parity (even/odd) changes based on the input string `s`.
    #   - The variables `mn` and `mx` record the minimum and maximum values of `cur` during the processing of `s`.
    #
    #2. **Final Values After All Iterations:**
    #   - Since the loop iterates `t` times, `t` different strings `s` are processed.
    #   - After processing all `t` strings, `mn` will be the minimum value of `cur` across all strings.
    #   - Similarly, `mx` will be the maximum value of `cur` across all strings.
    #   - `cur` will be the final value of `cur` after processing the last string `s`.
    #
    #3. **Output State After All Iterations:**
    #   - The loop will execute exactly `t` times, and for each iteration, `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` will be updated accordingly.
    #   - The value printed will be `mx - mn`, which represents the range of `cur` values across all processed strings.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #After all iterations of the loop, the following will hold true:
    #- `t` is the number of times the outer loop has executed.
    #- `mn` is the minimum value that `cur` took across all iterations.
    #- `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` took across all iterations.
    #- `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing the last string `s`.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #```plaintext
    #Output State: t is the number of times the outer loop has executed, mn is the minimum value that cur took across all iterations, mx is the maximum value that cur took across all iterations, cur is the final value of cur after processing the last string s.
    #```
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `s` through its internal processing of multiple test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `s` is a binary string of length `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
