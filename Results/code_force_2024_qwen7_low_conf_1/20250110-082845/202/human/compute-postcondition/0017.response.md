`cur` is decremented by 1, meaning `cur = cur - 1`. The value of `cur` changes, but the other variables (`mx` and `next_c`) remain unaffected. The index of the current character is also increased by 1, which is another state that needs to be updated.

Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur`, `cur` is `cur - 1`, and the index of the current character is increased by 1.**
