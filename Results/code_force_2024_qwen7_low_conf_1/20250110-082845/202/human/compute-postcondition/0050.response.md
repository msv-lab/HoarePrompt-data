The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` was either `k + 2` or `k`. Since `cur_new` was used in calculating `mx` and `mn`, and `cur_new` is now updated to `cur + 1`, the values of `mx` and `mn` remain the same as they are based on the previous value of `cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is `k + 3` or `k + 1`; `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur_new`; `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and `cur_new`.

Output State: **`cur` is `k + 3` or `k + 1`; `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur_new`; `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and `cur_new`.**
