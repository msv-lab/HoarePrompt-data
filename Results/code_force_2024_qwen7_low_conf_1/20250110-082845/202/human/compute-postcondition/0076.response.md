The code updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum between its current value and `cur`. Since `cur` is now either 2 or 0 (previously it was either 1 or -1), `mx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and 2, as 2 is the highest value `cur` can take.

- If `cur` was initially 1, `cur` changes to 2.
- If `cur` was initially -1, `cur` changes to 0.
- In both cases, `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 2.

Since the initial value of `mx` is not specified, we denote it as `mx_initial`.

- If `mx_initial` is less than 2, `mx` will be updated to 2.
- If `mx_initial` is 2 or more, `mx` will remain unchanged.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `mn`, `cur`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least two characters, `mn` remains unchanged, `mx` is 2 if `mx_initial` was less than 2, otherwise `mx` remains `mx_initial`, `cur` is 2 if it was initially 1, or 0 if it was initially -1.**
