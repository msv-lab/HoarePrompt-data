The code snippet `print(mx - mn)` does not modify any variables but rather prints the difference between `mx` and `mn`. The values of `mx`, `mn`, and `cur` remain unchanged after this line of code is executed.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, the output is `mx - mn`**
