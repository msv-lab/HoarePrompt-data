The code snippet `print(mx - mn)` calculates the difference between the maximum value (`mx`) and the minimum value (`mn`) that `cur` took during the loop. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program step by step.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `mn` is initialized to 0.
   - `mx` is initialized to 0.
   - `cur` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop processes each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `(cur % 2 == 0)` equals `(c == '1')`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.
     - Otherwise, `cur` is decremented by 1.
   - After each iteration, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the new value of `cur`.
   - Similarly, `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the new value of `cur`.

3. **Behavior of `cur`**:
   - As previously analyzed, `cur` will alternate between 0 and 1 (or -1) based on the parity of its value and the condition involving `c == '1'`.

4. **Final Values**:
   - After processing all characters in `s`, `cur` will be either 0 or 1 (or -1).
   - `mn` will be the minimum value `cur` took during the loop.
   - `mx` will be the maximum value `cur` took during the loop.

5. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `mx - mn` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values that `cur` took.
   - Since `cur` alternates between 0 and 1 (or -1), the possible values for `mn` and `mx` are 0 and 1 (or -1).

6. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `cur` ends up being 0, then `mn` and `mx` could both be 0, making `mx - mn` equal to 0.
   - If `cur` ends up being 1, then `mn` is 0 and `mx` is 1, making `mx - mn` equal to 1.
   - If `cur` ends up being -1, then `mn` is -1 and `mx` is 0, making `mx - mn` equal to 1.

Therefore, the output of the code `print(mx - mn)` will be either 0 or 1, depending on the final value of `cur`.

**Output State: `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user, `cur` is either 0 or 1 (or -1), `mn` is the minimum value `cur` took during the loop, `mx` is the maximum value `cur` took during the loop, and the value printed is either 0 or 1.**

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user, `cur` is either 0 or 1 (or -1), `mn` is the minimum value `cur` took during the loop, `mx` is the maximum value `cur` took during the loop, and the value printed is either 0 or 1.**
