Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- \( t \geq 1 \)
- \( n \) is an integer input from the user
- \( s \) is a binary string of length \( n \)
- \( mn = 0 \)
- \( mx = 0 \)
- \( cur = 0 \)

### Loop Code:
```python
for c in s:
    if (cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1'):
        cur = cur + 1
    else:
        cur = cur - 1
    mn = min(mn, cur)
    mx = max(mx, cur)
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
1. **Condition Check**: The loop iterates over each character `c` in the binary string `s`. For each character, it checks whether `cur % 2` is equal to `c == '1'`.
   - If `cur % 2 == 0` and `c == '1'`, then `cur` increases by 1.
   - If `cur % 2 != 0` and `c == '0'`, then `cur` decreases by 1.
   
2. **Update `mn` and `mx`**:
   - `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cur`.
   - `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`.

### Output State After All Iterations:

To determine the final state, we need to consider the possible values and relationships of the variables after the loop has executed all iterations.

- **`mn` and `mx`**:
  - `mn` will be the minimum value that `cur` has taken during the entire loop execution.
  - `mx` will be the maximum value that `cur` has taken during the entire loop execution.

- **`cur`**:
  - `cur` will reflect the final value after processing all characters in the string `s`. This value depends on the sequence of `1`s and `0`s in `s` and how they affect `cur` based on the condition check.

Given that the loop processes all characters in `s`, the final value of `cur` will be determined by the sequence of increments and decrements based on the conditions. Since the loop always updates `cur` according to the condition and the minimum and maximum values are tracked, the final values of `mn` and `mx` will be the smallest and largest values that `cur` takes during the loop execution.

### Conclusion:
The loop processes all characters in the string `s`, updating `cur`, `mn`, and `mx` accordingly. The final values of `mn` and `mx` are the minimum and maximum values of `cur` after processing all characters, and `cur` itself will be the last value of `cur` after the loop completes.

### Output State:
**Output State: `mn` is the minimum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`.**
