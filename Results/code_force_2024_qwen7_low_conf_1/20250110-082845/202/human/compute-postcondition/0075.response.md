The code `mn = min(mn, cur)` updates the value of `mn` to be the minimum between its current value and `cur`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
- `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least two characters.
- `mn` and `mx` are updated based on the value of `cur`: if `cur` was 1, `mn` becomes 0 and `mx` remains 0, if `cur` was -1, `mn` becomes -1 and `mx` remains 0.
- `cur` is now 2 if it was initially 1, or `cur - 1` if it was initially -1.

We need to determine the effect of this line of code.

### Case Analysis Based on Initial Value of `cur`:
1. **If `cur` was initially 1:**
   - `mn` became 0.
   - `mx` remained 0.
   - Now `cur` is 2.
   - After executing `mn = min(mn, cur)`, `mn` will remain 0 because `min(0, 2) = 0`.

2. **If `cur` was initially -1:**
   - `mn` became -1.
   - `mx` remained 0.
   - Now `cur` is 0 (since `-1 - 1 = -2` but we need to check if it falls into the valid range and adjust accordingly).
   - After executing `mn = min(mn, cur)`, `mn` will remain -1 because `min(-1, 0) = -1`.

In both cases, `mn` does not change because `cur` in both scenarios (when initially 1 or -1) is larger than the current value of `mn`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
- `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least two characters.
- `mn` remains unchanged based on the initial condition.
- `mx` remains unchanged based on the initial condition.
- `cur` is now 2 if it was initially 1, or 0 if it was initially -1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least two characters, `mn` remains unchanged, `mx` remains unchanged, `cur` is now 2 if it was initially 1, or 0 if it was initially -1.**
