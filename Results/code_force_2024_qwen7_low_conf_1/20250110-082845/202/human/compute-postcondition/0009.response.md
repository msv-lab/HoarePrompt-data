The code increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since `cur` was initially even when `c` is '1', adding 1 to an even number results in an odd number. Therefore, the new value of `cur` is odd. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` must have at least one character, the current value of `cur` is odd if and only if the character `c` is '1'.**
