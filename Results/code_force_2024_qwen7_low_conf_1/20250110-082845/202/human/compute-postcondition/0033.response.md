The code sets `mx` to 0, which means the maximum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution (`mx`) is now 0. The value of `mn` remains unchanged at 0, and the value of `cur` is also unchanged because no operation was performed on it within this snippet. The input integer `n` and the string `s` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is the updated value of `cur` after processing the next character in `s`, `n` is an input integer, and the output is `mx - mn` which is `0 - 0 = 0`.**
