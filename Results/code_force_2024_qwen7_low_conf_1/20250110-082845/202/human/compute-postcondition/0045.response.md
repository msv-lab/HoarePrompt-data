The value of `cur` is decremented by 1, changing it from `k + 1` to `k`. The value of `mx` remains unchanged because it was defined as the maximum of `mx` and `k + 1`, and `mx` was not explicitly updated in the code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cur` and the unchanged value of `mx`.

Output State: **`cur` is `k`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `k + 1`**
