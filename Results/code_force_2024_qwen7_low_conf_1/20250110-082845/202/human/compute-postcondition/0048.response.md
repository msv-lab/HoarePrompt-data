The code `mx = max(mx, cur)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`. Given that `cur` is either `k + 2` or `k`, and `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `k + 1`, we need to consider the possible values for `cur` and their impact on `mx`.

- If `cur` is `k + 2`, then `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of `mx` and `k + 2`.
- If `cur` is `k`, then `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of `mx` and `k`.

Since `mx` is already the maximum of `mx` and `k + 1`, the new value of `mx` will be:

- If `cur` is `k + 2` and `k + 2 > mx`, then `mx` becomes `k + 2`.
- If `cur` is `k + 2` and `k + 2 <= mx`, then `mx` remains `mx`.
- If `cur` is `k` and `k > mx`, then `mx` becomes `k`.
- If `cur` is `k` and `k <= mx`, then `mx` remains `mx`.

Therefore, the updated value of `mx` depends on the comparison between `cur` and `mx`.

Output State: **`cur` is either `k + 2` or `k`; `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and the value of `cur`; `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and `cur`**
