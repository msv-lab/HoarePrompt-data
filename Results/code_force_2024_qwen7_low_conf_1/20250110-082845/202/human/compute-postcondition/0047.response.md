The code assigns the minimum value between `mn` and `cur` to `mn`. Since `cur` can be either `k + 2` or `k`, and the exact value of `mn` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `mn` without knowing its current value. However, we know that `mn` will be updated to the smaller of its current value and `cur`.

The impact on the other variables is minimal; `mx` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it, and `c` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not involved in this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is either `k + 2` or `k`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `k + 1`, `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and `cur`**
