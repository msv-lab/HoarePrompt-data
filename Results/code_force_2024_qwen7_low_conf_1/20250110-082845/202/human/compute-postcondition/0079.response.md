The variable `cur` is decremented by 1. Given that `cur` was initially 2 if it was 1, or 0 if it was -1, decrementing it by 1 changes its value to 1 if it was initially 2, or -1 if it was initially 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character remaining, `mn` remains unchanged, `mx` is 2 if `mx_initial` was less than 2, otherwise `mx` remains `mx_initial`, `cur` is 1 if it was initially 2, or -1 if it was initially 0**
