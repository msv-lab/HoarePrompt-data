The code `mn = min(mn, cur)` updates `mn` to be the smaller of its current value and `cur`. Given the initial conditions, `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and `cur`. Since `cur` can be either `k + 2`, `k + 1`, `k`, `k - 1`, and the value of `mn` is updated to be the minimum of itself and `cur`, `mn` will take the smaller value between its original value and `cur`.

The states of the other variables (`mx`, `cur_new`, and `c`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `mn` is now the minimum of its original value and `cur`.
- `mx` remains unchanged.
- `cur_new` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is either `k + 2`, `k + 1`, `k`, `k - 1`; `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur_new`; `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and `cur`.**
