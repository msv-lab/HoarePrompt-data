The code assigns the value 0 to `mx`. The value of `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user, and `mn` is 0. The assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, or `mn`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0**
