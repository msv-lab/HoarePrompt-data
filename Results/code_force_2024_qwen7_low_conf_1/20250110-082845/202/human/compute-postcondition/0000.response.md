`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `s` is a binary string of length n.**
