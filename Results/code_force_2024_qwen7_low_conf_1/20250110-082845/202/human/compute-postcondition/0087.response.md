Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It then calculates the range of values that a counter `cur` takes, starting from 0, while iterating over the characters of `s`. The counter `cur` increments by 1 if the current character and the previous value of `cur` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and decrements by 1 otherwise. The function keeps track of the minimum and maximum values of `cur` across all test cases. Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `cur` for each test case.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input string `s` consists entirely of '0's, the counter `cur` will remain 0 throughout the processing, resulting in a range of 0.
- If the input string `s` consists entirely of '1's, the counter `cur` will oscillate between 1 and -1, resulting in a range of 2.
- If `t` is 1, the function will process only one test case, and the final output will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `cur` for that single test case.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle any errors related to invalid input, such as non-integer values for `t` or `n`, or strings that are not binary or do not have the correct length.
