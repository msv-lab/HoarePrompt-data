The code snippet `print(mx - mn)` calculates and prints the difference between `mx` (the maximum value of `cur` during the loop) and `mn` (the minimum value of `cur` during the loop). However, the values of `mx` and `mn` are derived from the values of `cur` during the processing of the string `s`, and these values are not directly modified by the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `mx` and `mn` remain unchanged.

The code does not affect any other variables, and it simply prints the value of `mx - mn`. Since the values of `mx` and `mn` are already determined before this line of code is executed, they remain the same after the execution of this line.

Output State: **`cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` during the loop, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` during the loop, and the value printed is `mx - mn`.**
