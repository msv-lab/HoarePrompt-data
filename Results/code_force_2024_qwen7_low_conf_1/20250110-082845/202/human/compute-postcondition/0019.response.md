The code snippet provided updates the variable `mn` by setting it to the minimum of its current value and `cur`. However, the values of `mx` and `cur` are not directly modified by this line of code. The conditions for updating `mx` and `cur` are not present in the given code snippet.

Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. `mn = min(mn, cur)` - This line sets `mn` to the minimum of its current value and `cur`.

Since no specific values for `mn` and `cur` are given in the initial state, let's denote the initial value of `mn` as `mn_initial` and the initial value of `cur` as `cur_initial`.

After executing the line `mn = min(mn, cur)`, the value of `mn` will be the minimum of `mn_initial` and `cur_initial`. The value of `cur` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur_initial`, the index of the current character is increased by 1, `mn` is the minimum of `mn_initial` and `cur_initial`, and `cur` is `cur_initial`.**
