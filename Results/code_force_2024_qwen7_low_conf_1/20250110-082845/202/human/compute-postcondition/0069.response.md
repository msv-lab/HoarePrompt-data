`mn` is assigned the minimum value between `mn` (which is 0) and `cur`. The value of `cur` depends on the condition `cur` % 2 == int(c == '1').

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
- `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character.
- `mn` is 0.
- `mx` is 0.
- If `cur` % 2 is equal to `c == '1'`, then `cur` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cur` is set to -1.

Since the exact value of `cur` is not given in the initial state, let's consider the two possible cases:

1. If `cur` % 2 == int(c == '1'):
   - `cur` is set to 1.
   - After executing `mn = min(mn, cur)`, since `mn` is 0 and `cur` is 1, `mn` remains 0.

2. If `cur` % 2 != int(c == '1'):
   - `cur` is set to -1.
   - After executing `mn = min(mn, cur)`, since `mn` is 0 and `cur` is -1, `mn` changes to -1.

Therefore, the output state is dependent on the value of `cur` after the condition is evaluated. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character, `mn` is 0 if `cur` is 1 and -1 if `cur` is -1, `mx` is 0.**
