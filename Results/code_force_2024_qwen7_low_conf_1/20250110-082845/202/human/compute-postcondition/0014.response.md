The code updates `mx` to the maximum of its current value and `cur`. Let's analyze the impact:

1. `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `cur`.
2. `cur` is defined as `cur % 2 == (c == '1')`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `mx` and `cur`, we'll keep them in their symbolic form. After executing the code, `mx` will take the maximum value between its original value and `cur`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur`, `cur` is `cur % 2 == (c == '1')`**
