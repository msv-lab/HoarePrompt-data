The code `mx = max(mx, cur)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum between its current value (`mx`) and the value of `cur`. The initial state of `cur` is not explicitly defined, but it is assumed to be an integer. The other variables are already defined.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
- `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character.
- `mn` is 0 if `cur` is 1 and -1 if `cur` is -1.
- `mx` is 0.

The code updates `mx` to be the maximum between its current value (0) and the value of `cur`. Since `cur` is not specified, we consider both possible cases:

1. If `cur` is 1, then `mn` is 0.
2. If `cur` is -1, then `mn` is -1.
3. If `cur` is any other value, `mx` remains 0.

Let's consider these cases:

- If `cur` is 1, then `mx` will be updated to 1 because `max(0, 1)` is 1.
- If `cur` is -1, then `mx` remains 0 because `max(0, -1)` is 0.
- If `cur` is any other value, `mx` remains 0 because `max(0, <any other value>)` is `<any other value>` but since `mx` was initially 0, it stays 0.

In summary, the value of `mx` will either be 1 if `cur` is 1, or remain 0 otherwise. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `mn`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character, `mn` is 0 if `cur` is 1 and -1 if `cur` is -1, `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1 and 0 otherwise.**
