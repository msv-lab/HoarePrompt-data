The code snippet updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
   - `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character remaining.
   - `mn` is the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`.
   - `mx` is 2 if `mx_initial` was less than 2, otherwise `mx` remains `mx_initial`.
   - `cur` is updated to 3 if it was initially 1, 1 if it was initially 2 or 0, and 1 if it was initially -1.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The line `mx = max(mx, cur)` updates `mx` to be the maximum value between its current value and `cur`.

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The value of `cur` depends on its initial value:
     - If `cur` was initially 1, it is now 3.
     - If `cur` was initially 2 or 0, it is now 1.
     - If `cur` was initially -1, it is now 1.
   - Since `mx` was set to 2 if `mx_initial` was less than 2, otherwise it remained `mx_initial`, and given the potential changes in `cur`, `mx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the new `cur`.

4. **Final Values**:
   - If `cur` was initially 1, `mx` will be updated to the maximum of 2 (if `mx_initial` was less than 2) and 3, which is 3.
   - If `cur` was initially 2 or 0, `mx` will be updated to the maximum of 2 (if `mx_initial` was less than 2) and 1, which is 2.
   - If `cur` was initially -1, `mx` will be updated to the maximum of 2 (if `mx_initial` was less than 2) and 1, which is 2.

Thus, the final values after executing the code are:
- `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
- `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character remaining.
- `mn` is the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`.
- `mx` is 3 if `cur` was initially 1, and 2 otherwise.
- `cur` is 3 if it was initially 1, 1 if it was initially 2 or 0, and 1 if it was initially -1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character remaining, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`, `mx` is 3 if `cur` was initially 1, and 2 otherwise, `cur` is 3 if it was initially 1, 1 if it was initially 2 or 0, and 1 if it was initially -1.**
