According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
- `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character.
- `mn` is 0 if `cur` is 1 and -1 if `cur` is -1.
- `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1 and 0 otherwise.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must still have at least one character remaining to iterate over. Since we are removing one character per iteration, `s` must have at least two characters remaining.

Let's break down the steps:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` has at least one character.
2. For the loop to continue, `s` must have at least two characters remaining.
3. Therefore, `s` should now have one character less than it had at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least two characters, `mn` is 0 if `cur` is 1 and -1 if `cur` is -1, `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1 and 0 otherwise**
