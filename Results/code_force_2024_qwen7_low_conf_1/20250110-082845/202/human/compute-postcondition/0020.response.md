The code updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its original value and `cur`. Since `cur` is equal to `cur_initial`, the updated value of `mx` will be the maximum of `mx` and `cur_initial`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur_initial`, the index of the current character is increased by 1, `mn` is the minimum of `mn_initial` and `cur_initial`, and `cur` is `cur_initial`.**
