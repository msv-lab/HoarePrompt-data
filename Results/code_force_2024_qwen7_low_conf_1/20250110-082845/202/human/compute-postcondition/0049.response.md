Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `cur` is either `k + 2` or `k`.
  - `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and the value of `cur`.
  - `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and the value of `cur`.

- The loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`. However, the specific operations inside the loop are not provided. Based on the given information, we can infer that the loop likely involves updating the `cur` variable with some function of the current character `c` in the string `s`.

### Key Points to Consider
1. **`cur`**: This value could change based on the character `c` in the loop.
2. **`mx`**: This is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new `cur` value.
3. **`mn`**: This is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the new `cur` value.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `cur` could be either `k + 2` or `k` (end of the previous iteration).
   - `mx` and `mn` are initialized or updated based on `cur`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the next iteration, the value of `cur` will be determined by the current character `c` in the string `s`.
   - `mx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the new `cur` value.
   - `mn` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and the new `cur` value.

### Conclusion
Since the exact update logic for `cur` is not provided, we can only state that `cur` will be updated to some value based on the current character `c` in the string `s`. However, the key points to remember are:
- `mx` will be the maximum of its current value and the new `cur` value.
- `mn` will be the minimum of its current value and the new `cur` value.

### Updated States
Given that the exact value of `cur` is not specified, we can represent it as `cur_new` where `cur_new` is the value of `cur` after processing the current character `c`.

#### Final Answer:
State: **`cur` is either `k + 2` or `k`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur_new`, `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and `cur_new`**

Here, `cur_new` is the value of `cur` after processing the current character `c` in the string `s`.
