`cur` is decremented by 1. The initial condition is that `s` must have at least one character, and either `cur % 2 != 0` or `c != '1'`. Since `cur` is decreased by 1, the new condition will be `cur % 2 == 0` (if it was odd before) or `c != '1'` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` must have at least one character; either `cur % 2 == 0` or `c != '1'`.

Output State: **`s` must have at least one character; either `cur % 2 == 0` or `c != '1'`**
