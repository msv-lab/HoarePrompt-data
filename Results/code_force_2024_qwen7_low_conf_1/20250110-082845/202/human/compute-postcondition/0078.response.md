`cur` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` changes from 2 (if it was initially 1) or from 0 (if it was initially -1). All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character remaining, `mn` remains unchanged, `mx` is 2 if `mx_initial` was less than 2, otherwise `mx` remains `mx_initial`, `cur` is now 3 if it was initially 1 or 1 if it was initially -1.
