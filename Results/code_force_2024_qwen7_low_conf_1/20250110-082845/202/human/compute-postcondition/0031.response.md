`s` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user. The values of `mn`, `mx`, `cur`, and `n` remain unchanged. The output of the code is `mx - mn`, which depends on the values of `mx` and `mn` after processing the string `s`.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `cur` is the updated value of `cur` after processing the next character in `s`, `n` is an input integer, and the output is `mx - mn`**
