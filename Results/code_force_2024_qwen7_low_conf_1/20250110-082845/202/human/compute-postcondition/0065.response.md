`cur` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` was 0 because it satisfies the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`. After incrementing, `cur` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `s`, `mn`, `mx`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 1, the current value of `c` satisfies the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`**
