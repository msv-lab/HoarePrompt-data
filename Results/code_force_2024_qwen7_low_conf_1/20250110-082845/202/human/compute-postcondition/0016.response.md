The code updates the value of `cur` by incrementing it by 1. Given the initial state, `cur` was previously calculated as `cur % 2 == (next_c == '1')`. After executing `cur = cur + 1`, the value of `cur` is updated to its original value plus 1. The maximum value `mx` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `mx` directly. The index of the current character is also increased by 1, but since no variable represents this index, we do not need to include this in the output state.

Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur`, `cur` is (`cur % 2 == (next_c == '1')`) + 1, and the index of the current character is increased by 1.**
