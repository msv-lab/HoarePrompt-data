According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string because `enumerate(s)` will iterate over each character in `s`.

Let's break down the current state and what needs to be adjusted:

1. **Current State:**
   - `mn` is 0
   - `mx` is 0
   - `cur` is 0
   - The output `mx - mn` is 0

2. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty string.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, the values of `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` might change within the loop, but these values do not affect whether the loop can start executing. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted based on their current values (0).

Given this analysis, the state that needs adjustment is the string `s`.
