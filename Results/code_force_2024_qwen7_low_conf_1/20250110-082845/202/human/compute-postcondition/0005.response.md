The code initializes the variable `mx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, or `mn`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0**
