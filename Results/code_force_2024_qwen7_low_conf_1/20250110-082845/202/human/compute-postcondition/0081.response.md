`mn` is assigned the value of the minimum between `mn` and `cur`. Based on the rules provided, `cur` changes depending on its initial value. Since the initial values of `n`, `s`, `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` are given in the context:

- `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
- `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character remaining.
- `mn` remains unchanged.
- `mx` is 2 if `mx_initial` was less than 2, otherwise `mx` remains `mx_initial`.
- `cur` changes as follows: if `cur` was initially 1, it becomes 3; if `cur` was initially -1, it becomes 1; if `cur` was initially 2, it becomes 1; if `cur` was initially 0, it becomes -1.

After the code executes, `mn` will be updated to be the minimum value between its original value and the new value of `cur`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character remaining, `mn` is the minimum of its original value and the new value of `cur`, `mx` is 2 if `mx_initial` was less than 2, otherwise `mx` remains `mx_initial`, `cur` is updated to 3 if it was initially 1, 1 if it was initially 2 or 0, and 1 if it was initially -1.**
