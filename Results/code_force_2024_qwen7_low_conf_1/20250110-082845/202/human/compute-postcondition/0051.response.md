The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `cur` was either `k + 2` or `k`. After decrementing, the new value of `cur` will be either `(k + 2) - 1` or `k - 1`, which simplifies to `k + 1` or `k-1`. The values of `mx` and `mn` remain unchanged as they were determined based on the previous value of `cur_new`, which is no longer directly referenced in this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is either `k + 1` or `k - 1`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur_new`, `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and `cur_new`**
