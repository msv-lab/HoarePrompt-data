The variable `cur` is decremented by 1. Initially, `mn` is set to 0 if `cur` is 1 and -1 if `cur` is -1, and `mx` is set to 1 if `cur` is 1 and 0 otherwise. Since `cur` is being decremented, its new value depends on its previous value.

- If `cur` was initially 1, then `mn` was 0 and `mx` was 1.
- If `cur` was initially -1, then `mn` was -1 and `mx` was 0.

After decrementing `cur`:
- If `cur` was initially 1, then `cur` is now 0, so `mn` remains 0 and `mx` is now 0.
- If `cur` was initially -1, then `cur` is now -2, so `mn` remains -1 and `mx` remains 0.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least two characters, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0 if `cur` was 1, `mn` is -1, `mx` is 0 if `cur` was -1, and `cur` is `cur - 1`.**
