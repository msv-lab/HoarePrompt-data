The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the given code snippet. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, it seems the function might be expected to handle multiple test cases internally, where each test case consists of three values: `t`, `n`, and `s`.

Here are the parameters and their constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This suggests that the function will process `t` test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- For each test case, `s` is a binary string of length `n`.

Given the output information is not provided directly but inferred from the problem setup, the function's behavior can be described as follows:

The function `func_1` accepts `t`, `n`, and `s` through its internal processing of multiple test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `s` through its internal processing of multiple test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `s` is a binary string of length `n`.**
