According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character. The variables `n`, `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` are not directly related to the loop's condition but may be used within the loop body.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` has at least one character for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0**
