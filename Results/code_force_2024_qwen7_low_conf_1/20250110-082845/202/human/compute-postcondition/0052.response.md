Postcondition: ***`cur` is either `k + 2`, `k + 1`, `k`, `k - 1`; `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur_new`; `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and `cur_new`. If `cur % 2 == 0` is true when `c == '1'`, then `cur` is either `k + 3` or `k + 1`. Otherwise, if `cur % 2 == 0` is false when `c == '1'`, then `cur` is either `k + 1` or `k - 1`.***
