The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. The initial state of `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` is preserved, but `n` is now an integer obtained from user input. The output is `mx - mn`.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` takes during the loop execution, `cur` is the updated value of `cur` after processing the next character in `s`, `n` is an input integer, and the output is `mx - mn`**.
