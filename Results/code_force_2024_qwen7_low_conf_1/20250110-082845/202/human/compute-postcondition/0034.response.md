The code `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. The values of `mn`, `mx`, `n`, and the output `mx - mn` (which was initially 0) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the updated values are as follows: `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, and the output `mx - mn` remains 0.

Output State: **`mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, the output `mx - mn` is 0**
