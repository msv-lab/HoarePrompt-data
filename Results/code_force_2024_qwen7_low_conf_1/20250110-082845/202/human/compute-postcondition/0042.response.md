The code `mx = max(mx, cur)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum between its current value and `cur`. However, the initial value of `mx` is not provided in the initial state. Given that `cur` is `k`, the output state will depend on the value of `mx` before this line of code was executed.

If `mx` is less than or equal to `k`, then `mx` will be updated to `k`. If `mx` is already greater than `k`, then `mx` remains unchanged.

Since the initial value of `mx` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `mx` without that information. However, we know that `cur` is `k`.

Output State: **`cur` is `k`, `mx` is either `mx` (if `mx` >= `k`) or `k` (if `mx` < `k`)**
