Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least two characters. `mn` and `mx` are updated based on the value of `cur`: if `cur` was 1, `mn` becomes 0 and `mx` remains 0, if `cur` was -1, `mn` becomes -1 and `mx` remains 0. `cur` is now 2 if it was initially 1, or `cur - 1` if it was initially -1.***
