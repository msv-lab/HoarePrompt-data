The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `n`. The initial value of `t` is not affected by this operation, and the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is a binary string of length `n`. Therefore, the updated state includes `n` being assigned the value of the integer input from the user, while `t` remains greater than or equal to 1 and `s` remains a binary string of length `n`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `s` is a binary string of length `n`**
