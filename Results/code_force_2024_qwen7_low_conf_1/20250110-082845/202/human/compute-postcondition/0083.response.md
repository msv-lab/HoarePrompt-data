To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the variables `cur`, `mn`, and `mx` step by step based on the given conditions and initial observations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `mn` is initialized to 0.
   - `mx` is initialized to 0.
   - `cur` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `(cur % 2 == 0)` equals `(c == '1')`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.
     - Otherwise, `cur` is decremented by 1.
   - After each iteration, `mn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the new value of `cur`.
   - Similarly, `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the new value of `cur`.

3. **Behavior of `cur`**:
   - `cur` alternates between 0 and 1 (or -1) based on the parity of its value and the condition involving `c == '1'`.
   - If `cur` starts at 0:
     - `c == '1'` makes `cur` become 1.
     - Next, `c != '1'` makes `cur` become 0.
     - This pattern continues.
   - If `cur` starts at -1:
     - `c == '1'` makes `cur` become 0.
     - Next, `c != '1'` makes `cur` become -1.
     - This pattern continues.

4. **Final Values**:
   - After all characters in `s` are processed, `cur` will end up being either 0 or 1 (or -1).
   - `mn` will be the minimum value `cur` reached during the loop.
   - `mx` will be the maximum value `cur` reached during the loop.

### Final Output State

Given that the loop will process all characters in `s`, the final values of `cur`, `mn`, and `mx` can be determined based on the last value of `cur` and the range it has traversed.

- `n` remains an integer obtained from user input.
- `s` remains a string input by the user.
- `cur` will be either 0 or 1 (or -1), depending on the last character processed and whether the number of '1's in the string is even or odd.
- `mn` will be the minimum value `cur` took during the loop.
- `mx` will be the maximum value `cur` took during the loop.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:

**Output State: `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user, `cur` is either 0 or 1 (or -1), `mn` is the minimum value `cur` took during the loop, `mx` is the maximum value `cur` took during the loop.**
