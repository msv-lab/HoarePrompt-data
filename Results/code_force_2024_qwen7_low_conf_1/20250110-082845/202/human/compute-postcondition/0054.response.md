The code updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`. Given that `cur` is either `k + 2`, `k + 1`, `k`, `k - 1`, the new value of `mx` will be the maximum between its original value and one of these expressions.

The states of `cur_new` and `mn` remain unchanged. Thus, the updated values are:
- `mx` is now the maximum of its original value and `cur`.
- `cur_new` remains the same.
- `mn` remains the same.

Output State: **`cur` is either `k + 2`, `k + 1`, `k`, `k - 1`; `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur`; `mn` is the minimum of `mn` and `cur`.**
