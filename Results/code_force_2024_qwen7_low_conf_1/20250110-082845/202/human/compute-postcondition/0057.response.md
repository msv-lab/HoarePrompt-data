Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `cur` is the final value of `cur` after processing all characters in `s` (though this specific value isn't directly relevant for the loop).
   - `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` during the loop.
   - `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` during the loop.
   - The value printed is `mx - mn`.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates `t` times.
   - The loop body processes some character or updates `cur`, but we don't know the exact details of the loop body.

3. **Key Variables**:
   - `mx`: This variable holds the maximum value of `cur` encountered during each iteration of the loop.
   - `mn`: This variable holds the minimum value of `cur` encountered during each iteration of the loop.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - After the first iteration, the values of `mx` and `mn` will be updated based on the new values of `cur` from the current iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `t` is the number of iterations and we need it to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the current number of iterations completed.
   - `mx` and `mn` will be updated based on the new value of `cur` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop can still execute, meaning `t` must be greater than the current number of iterations completed, and `mx` and `mn` will be updated based on the new value of `cur`.

**Final State**:
- `t` must be greater than the current number of iterations completed.
- `mx` and `mn` will be updated based on the new value of `cur`.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than the current number of iterations completed, `mx` and `mn` will be updated based on the new value of `cur`**.
