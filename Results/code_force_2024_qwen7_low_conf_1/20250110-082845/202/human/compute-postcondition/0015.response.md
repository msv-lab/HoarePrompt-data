To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur`.
- The variable `cur` is defined as `cur % 2 == (c == '1')`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `cur`:**
   - `cur` is determined by the current character `c` in the string `s`.
   - Specifically, `cur % 2 == (c == '1')` means:
     - If `c` is `'1'`, then `c == '1'` is `True`, so `cur % 2 == 1`.
     - If `c` is not `'1'`, then `c == '1'` is `False`, so `cur % 2 == 0`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur`.
   - This implies that `mx` retains the higher value between its original value and the new value of `cur` calculated based on the current character `c`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, the loop will consider the next character in the string `s`.
   - The variable `cur` will be recalculated based on this new character.
   - The variable `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`.

### Updated States:
- The string `s` remains unchanged, but the index of the current character is incremented.
- `mx` remains the maximum value seen so far.
- `cur` is recalculated based on the next character `c`.

### Final State:
- Since the loop is about to start another iteration, the state will be:
  - `mx` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
  - `cur` will be recalculated for the next character.
  - The index of the current character will increase by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur`, `cur` is `cur % 2 == (next_c == '1')` where `next_c` is the next character in the string `s`, and the index of the current character is increased by 1.**

However, since the exact value of `cur` is not provided, we can only describe the state in terms of what changes in the next iteration.

**State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur`, `cur` is `cur % 2 == (next_c == '1')`, and the index of the current character is increased by 1.**
