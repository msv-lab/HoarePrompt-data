The code snippet `mn = min(mn, cur)` calculates the minimum between `mn` and `cur` and assigns it back to `mn`. This does not change the value of `cur`, but updates `mn` to the smaller of its current value and `cur`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `cur` is an integer that has been adjusted based on the condition `(cur % 2 == (c == '1'))`.

Since the value of `cur` is already determined based on the condition and the code snippet does not affect `s` or change `cur` itself, only `mn` is updated.

Let's denote the value of `cur` as `k` (since its exact value is not specified, we represent it as `k`). The value of `mn` before this operation would be some previously defined value, say `m`.

The new value of `mn` will be `min(m, k)`, where `k` is the current value of `cur`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is `k`, `mn` is `min(m, k)`**
