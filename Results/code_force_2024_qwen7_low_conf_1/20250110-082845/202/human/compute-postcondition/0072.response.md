`cur` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` can only be 1 or -1 based on the initial state. If `cur` was 1, it becomes 2; if `cur` was -1, it becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least two characters, `mn` is 0 if `cur` is 1 and -1 if `cur` is -1, `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1 and 0 otherwise, `cur` is now 2 if it was initially 1, or 0 if it was initially -1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least two characters, `mn` is 0 if `cur` is 1 and -1 if `cur` is -1, `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1 and 0 otherwise, `cur` is now 2 if it was initially 1, or 0 if it was initially -1.**
