The given code snippet updates the variable `mn` with the minimum value between the current value of `mn` and `cur`. However, the initial state and the specific values of `mn` and `cur` are not provided in the prompt. We know that `cur % 2 == (c == '1')` must hold true after the execution of the if-else block, which means `cur` is even if `c` is '1', and `cur` is odd if `c` is not '1'.

Since the exact initial values of `mn` and `cur` are not specified, let's denote them generically:

- Let `mn_initial` be the initial value of `mn`.
- Let `cur_initial` be the initial value of `cur`.

After the line `mn = min(mn, cur)`, the value of `mn` will be updated to the smaller of its current value (`mn`) and the new value of `cur`. The condition `cur % 2 == (c == '1')` indicates the parity of `cur`, but does not directly affect the value of `mn`.

Output State: **`mn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cur`, `cur` is such that `cur % 2 == (c == '1')`**
