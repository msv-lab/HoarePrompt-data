According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` and the string `s`. The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur_initial`.
- The index of the current character is increased by 1.
- `mn` is the minimum of `mn_initial` and `cur_initial`.
- `cur` is `cur_initial`.

Since the loop increments the index of the current character by 1 at each iteration, we need to ensure that the new index is within the bounds of the string `s`.

Let's denote the length of the string `s` as `len(s)`. If the index of the current character is `i`, then `i + 1` should be less than `len(s)` for the loop to continue.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is `cur_initial`.
2. The index of the current character is increased by 1, so `cur` becomes `cur_initial + 1`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_initial + 1` must be less than `len(s)`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `mx` remains the same (maximum of its original value and `cur_initial`).
- The index of the current character is now `cur_initial + 1`.
- `mn` remains the same (minimum of `mn_initial` and `cur_initial`).
- `cur` is now `cur_initial + 1`.

State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cur_initial`, the index of the current character is `cur_initial + 1`, `mn` is the minimum of `mn_initial` and `cur_initial`, and `cur` is `cur_initial + 1`**.
