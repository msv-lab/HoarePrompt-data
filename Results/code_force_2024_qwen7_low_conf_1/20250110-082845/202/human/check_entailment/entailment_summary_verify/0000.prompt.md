You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a strip of paper with a binary string s of length n . You can fold
the paper in between any pair of adjacent digits.

A set of folds is considered valid if after the folds, all characters that are
on top of or below each other match. Note that all folds are made at the same
time, so the characters don't have to match in between folds.

For example, these are valid foldings of s = \mathtt{110110110011} and s =
\mathtt{01110} :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a961dc7cc221603a7d5a488247ba5439ce7444da.png)

The length of the folded strip is the length seen from above after all folds
are made. So for the two above examples, after the folds shown above, the
lengths would be 7 and 3 , respectively.

Notice that for the above folding of s = \mathtt{01110} , if we made either of
the two folds on their own, that would not be a valid folding. However,
because we don't check for validity until all folds are made, this folding is
valid.

After performing a set of valid folds, what is the minimum length strip you
can form?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the size of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters '0' and
'1' — a description of the digits on the strip.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible length of
the strip after a valid folding.

Example

Input

    101101

    01110
    
    4
    
    1111
    
    2
    
    01

Output

    3
    1
    3
    3
    1
    2
    
Note

For the first example case, one optimal folding is to fold the strip in the
middle, which produces a strip of length 3.

The third and fourth example cases correspond to the images above. Note that
the folding shown above for s = \mathtt{110110110011} is not of minimal
length.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        mn = 0
        mx = 0
        cur = 0
        for c in s:
            if (cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1'):
                cur = cur + 1
            else:
                cur = cur - 1
            mn = min(mn, cur)
            mx = max(mx, cur)
        print(mx - mn)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It then calculates the range of values that a counter `cur` takes, starting from 0, while iterating over the characters of `s`. The counter `cur` increments by 1 if the current character and the previous value of `cur` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and decrements by 1 otherwise. The function keeps track of the minimum and maximum values of `cur` across all test cases. Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `cur` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folding. Specifically, the logic used to determine `cur` does not accurately reflect whether a valid folding can be achieved.

For instance, consider the input `110110110011`. The program outputs `3`, but the correct minimum length after valid folding is `1`. This can be achieved by folding the string as follows:

- Fold at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, resulting in the sequence `111111111111` with a length of 1.

The current implementation seems to be counting the number of '1's and '0's in an alternating pattern, which is not relevant to the problem. A valid approach would involve checking if pairs of '0's and '1's can be matched after folding, and determining the minimum length based on these matches.

Here's a more appropriate way to solve the problem:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        count = 0
        prev_char = None
        for c in s:
            if c != prev_char:
                count += 1
            prev_char = c
        print(count)
```

This version counts the distinct runs of '0's and '1's, which gives the minimum length after valid folding.
