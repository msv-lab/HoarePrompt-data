Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the minimum possible length of the strip after a valid folding such that all characters on top of or below each other match after the folds.
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the binary string `s`.
   - It initializes counters `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`, updating the counter `cur` based on whether the character's parity matches the parity of the current count.
   - `cur` is incremented if the character and `cur` have the same parity, and decremented otherwise.
   - The minimum (`mn`) and maximum (`mx`) values of `cur` are tracked.
   - The difference `mx - mn` represents the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folding because `cur`'s range gives the span of folding points needed to ensure matching characters are aligned.

3. **Execution Summary Alignment**: 
   - The provided execution summary aligns with the program logic. The summary mentions calculating the range of values that a counter `cur` takes, which directly corresponds to the program's implementation.
   - The final output is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `cur`, which correctly reflects the minimum possible length of the strip.

Given this analysis, the program accurately implements the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
