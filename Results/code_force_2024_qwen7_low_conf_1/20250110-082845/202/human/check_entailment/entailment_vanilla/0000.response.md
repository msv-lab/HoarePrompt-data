Reasoning:

1. The program aims to find the minimum possible length of the strip after a valid folding.
2. The key logic is to track the current depth (`cur`) while iterating through the binary string `s`. This depth indicates how far apart the corresponding characters could be after folding.
3. If the current character `c` maintains the parity of `cur` (i.e., they are both even or both odd), it means they could be on the same side after folding, so `cur` increases.
4. If the current character `c` changes the parity of `cur`, it means they could be on opposite sides after folding, so `cur` decreases.
5. We maintain `mn` (minimum depth) and `mx` (maximum depth) to track the range of possible depths.
6. The final result is `mx - mn`, which gives the minimum possible length of the strip after folding.

Given the problem statement and the code, the logic correctly implements the required algorithm to find the minimum length after valid folding. It properly handles the tracking of the current depth and the range of depths.

Correctness: **True**
