Reasoning:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the binary string `s`.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - Variables `mn` and `mx` are initialized to 0. These will keep track of the minimum and maximum values of `cur` across all characters in the string `s`.
   - Variable `cur` is initialized to 0 and will be used to calculate the parity-based changes in the string `s`.

3. **Processing the String:**
   - The program iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - Based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, the value of `cur` is adjusted. If the current character and the parity of `cur` match, `cur` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is decremented by 1.
   - During each iteration, `mn` is updated to the minimum value of `cur`, and `mx` is updated to the maximum value of `cur`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - After processing all characters in the string `s`, the difference `mx - mn` is calculated and printed. This difference represents the minimum possible length of the strip after a valid folding.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in the program correctly handles the parity-based changes in the string `s`.
   - The values of `mn` and `mx` are correctly updated to reflect the range of `cur` values across all characters.
   - The final output, `mx - mn`, is indeed the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folding, as per the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis, the program accurately implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
