### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible length of the strip after a valid folding.
   - A valid folding ensures that all characters on top of or below each other match.
   - The length is determined by the range of depths (`cur`) encountered during the folding process.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The variable `cur` keeps track of the current depth as we iterate through the string `s`.
   - `cur` increases if the current character `c` maintains the parity of `cur` (both even or both odd).
   - `cur` decreases if the current character `c` changes the parity of `cur` (one even and one odd).
   - `mn` and `mx` track the minimum and maximum depths encountered, respectively.
   - The final result is `mx - mn`, which gives the minimum possible length of the strip after folding.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code correctly initializes `mn` and `mx` to 0.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, updating `cur` based on the parity condition.
   - `mn` and `mx` are updated to keep track of the minimum and maximum depths encountered.
   - Finally, `mx - mn` is printed, which is the required result.

4. **Validation Using Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The explanation provided in the annotations aligns with the logic of the code.
   - The code ensures that the parity condition is checked correctly, and the range of depths is tracked accurately.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement.
   - The logic for tracking the current depth and determining the minimum length after folding is sound.
   - The final result `mx - mn` accurately computes the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folding.

Given the analysis and validation, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
