Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the binary string `s` and the string itself.
   - These steps align with the problem statement's requirement to process multiple test cases.

2. **Folding Logic**:
   - The program uses a variable `cur` to keep track of the parity (even/odd) of the cumulative count of '1's in the string `s`.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s` and updates `cur` based on whether the current character is '1' or '0'.
   - Specifically, if the current position matches the expected parity (`cur % 2 == 0` for '0' and `cur % 2 != 0` for '1'), `cur` is incremented; otherwise, it is decremented.
   - This logic ensures that the program correctly tracks the parity changes as if the string were folded.

3. **Minimum and Maximum Parity Tracking**:
   - The program maintains two variables, `mn` and `mx`, to keep track of the minimum and maximum values of `cur` encountered during the iteration.
   - By updating `mn` and `mx` with each iteration, the program captures the range of parity values observed.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - After processing the entire string `s`, the program prints the difference `mx - mn`.
   - This difference represents the minimum possible length of the folded strip because it corresponds to the minimum range of `cur` values, which indicates how many positions in the string could potentially align perfectly after folding.

5. **Guaranteed Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem statement, such as \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like single-character strings (e.g., `"0"` or `"1"`) and longer strings efficiently by accurately tracking the parity changes and calculating the minimum length.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description, making the program correct.
