The function `func_2` accepts a binary string `s` and computes the value `n - pi[-1]`, where `n` is the length of `s` and `pi` is the result of the KMP failure function applied to `s`. The function returns this computed value. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is assumed that `s` is a non-empty binary string. The function does not handle empty strings explicitly, although the precondition `1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` ensures that `s` is non-empty.
