The function `func_3` accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two pieces of information: `n`, an integer representing the length of a binary string `s`, and `s` itself, a string consisting of '0' and '1'. The function then calls another function `func_2` with `s` as its argument and appends the result of `func_2(s)` to a list `results`. If `n` is 0, it directly appends 0 to `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in `results`.

Potential edge cases:
1. If `t` is 0, the function will read no data and `results` will be an empty list, resulting in no output.
2. If `n` is 0 for a test case, the function correctly appends 0 to `results` without calling `func_2`.

Missing functionality:
1. The annotation mentions that the state of the program after the for loop includes `idx` being the length of `data` or exactly 2 times the number of iterations + 1. However, the code only increments `idx` when reading `n` and `s`, and does not ensure that `idx` reaches the required state after processing all test cases. This is a potential issue if the input format does not strictly follow the expected pattern.
2. The annotation states that `results` is a list containing alternating 0 and the values returned by `func_2(s)`. However, if `n` is 0 for a test case, the function does not alternate between 0 and `func_2(s)`; instead, it simply appends 0. Therefore, `results` might not contain alternating values if `n` is 0 for any test case.

Final state of the program after conclusion:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `data` contains the remaining unparsed elements after processing all test cases.
- `idx` is set to the length of `data` or exactly 2 times the number of iterations + 1, ensuring that all input has been processed.
- `n` and `s` are not explicitly used after the loop and do not retain their values.
- `results` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of `func_2(s)` for each non-zero `n` in the test cases.
