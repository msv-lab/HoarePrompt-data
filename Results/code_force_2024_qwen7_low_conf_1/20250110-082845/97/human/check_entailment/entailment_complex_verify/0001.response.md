### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of Tents for Introverts:**
   - The function correctly initializes the number of tents needed for the introverts (`tents = a`). Since each introvert needs a separate tent, this is accurate.

2. **Handling Extroverts:**
   - The logic for handling extroverts (`b`) is mostly correct, but there are some potential issues:
     - **Case `b % 3 == 0`:** If `b` is divisible by 3, the function correctly adds `b // 3` to `tents`.
     - **Case `b % 3 == 1`:** The logic here checks if there are at least 2 universals available. If so, it adds `b // 3 + 1` to `tents` and reduces `c` by 2. However, if there are fewer than 2 universals, the function prints `-1`. This part is correct.
     - **Case `b % 3 == 2`:** Similarly, if `b % 3 == 2`, the function checks if there is at least 1 universal available. If so, it adds `b // 3 + 1` to `tents` and reduces `c` by 1. Again, if there are no universals, the function prints `-1`. This part is also correct.

3. **Handling Universals:**
   - After processing the extroverts, the function correctly calculates the number of tents needed for the remaining universals. The expression `c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)` ensures that all universals are accounted for, either filling complete tents or adding one more tent if there are any remaining universals. This is accurate.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where it might be impossible to accommodate the participants. For example, if there are not enough universals to pair with extroverts, the function prints `-1` and stops further calculations.

However, there are a couple of minor issues in the implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Extroverts:**
  - When `b % 3 == 1` and `c < 2`, the function prints `-1`. This is correct, but it should also consider the possibility of using universals to form a partial tent. Instead, the current logic directly prints `-1` without considering this possibility.
  
- **Potential Redundant Print Statements:**
  - The `print(-1)` statements are redundant because they are already handled within the conditional checks. The function could streamline the code by removing unnecessary `continue` statements and consolidating the logic.

### Final Evaluation:

Despite the minor issues mentioned above, the core logic of the function is correct and it handles all the necessary conditions to determine the minimum number of tents required. The edge cases are appropriately managed, and the function prints `-1` when it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

**Final: True**

The function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handle all possible scenarios.
