You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        tents = a
        if b % 3 == 0:
            tents += b // 3
        elif b % 3 == 1:
            if c >= 2:
                tents += b // 3 + 1
                c -= 2
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        elif b % 3 == 2:
            if c >= 1:
                tents += b // 3 + 1
                c -= 1
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        if c >= 0:
            tents += c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)
            print(tents)
        else:
            print(-1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the maximum number of tents (`tents`) that can be allocated based on certain conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, `a` represents the number of introverts, `b` the number of extroverts, and `c` the number of universals (which can be used as either introverts or extroverts). The function updates `tents` according to the following rules:

1. Initialize `tents` with the value of `a`.
2. If `b % 3 == 0`, add `b // 3` to `tents`.
3. If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, add `b // 3 + 1` to `tents` and decrement `c` by 2.
4. If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, add `b // 3 + 1` to `tents` and decrement `c` by 1.
5. After updating based on `b`, if `c` is non-negative, add up to one more tent (`c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)`).

If at any point `c` becomes negative due to the above operations, the function prints `-1` and does not proceed with further updates. Otherwise, it prints the final value of `tents`.

The function accepts `t` test cases and returns no explicit output, but prints the result for each test case during its execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more than two extroverts with a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, and no universals available to fill those two spots. Specifically, the logic for handling the case when `b % 3 == 2` does not account for the possibility that there might be enough universals to accommodate the extra extroverts.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 2 0
```
Here, there are 5 introverts, 2 extroverts, and 0 universals. According to the problem description, we need to put the 2 extroverts in one tent together, which leaves 3 extra spaces. Since there are no universals, this should result in -1 because it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts.

However, the current implementation will not detect this situation correctly and will proceed to allocate the remaining spaces without checking if there are enough universals, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, you would need to ensure that when `b % 3 == 2`, you check if there are at least 2 universals available before proceeding to allocate the remaining spaces.
