You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

            if c >= 1:
                tents += b // 3 + 1
                c -= 1
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tents` is the final value calculated after executing the loop for each of the `t` inputs. For each input:
    #- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers derived from the input such that `a` is the initial value of `tents`, `b` is the second value, and `c` is the third value.
    #- If `c` is non-negative, `tents` is updated based on the conditions involving `b % 3` and `c`:
    #  - If `b % 3 == 0`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3`.
    #  - If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 2.
    #  - If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
    #- If `c` becomes negative, the loop prints `-1` and stops further updates to `tents`.
    #- If `c` is non-negative at the end of all iterations, `tents` is printed after all the updates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the maximum number of tents (`tents`) that can be allocated based on certain conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, `a` represents the number of introverts, `b` the number of extroverts, and `c` the number of universals (which can be used as either introverts or extroverts). The function updates `tents` according to the following rules:

1. Initialize `tents` with the value of `a`.
2. If `b % 3 == 0`, add `b // 3` to `tents`.
3. If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, add `b // 3 + 1` to `tents` and decrement `c` by 2.
4. If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, add `b // 3 + 1` to `tents` and decrement `c` by 1.
5. After updating based on `b`, if `c` is non-negative, add up to one more tent (`c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)`).

If at any point `c` becomes negative due to the above operations, the function prints `-1` and does not proceed with further updates. Otherwise, it prints the final value of `tents`.

The function accepts `t` test cases and returns no explicit output, but prints the result for each test case during its execution.
