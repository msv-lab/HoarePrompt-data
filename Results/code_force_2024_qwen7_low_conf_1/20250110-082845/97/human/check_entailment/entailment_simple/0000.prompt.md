You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        tents = a
        
        if b % 3 == 0:
            tents += b // 3
        elif b % 3 == 1:
            if c >= 2:
                tents += b // 3 + 1
                c -= 2
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        elif b % 3 == 2:
            if c >= 1:
                tents += b // 3 + 1
                c -= 1
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
        if c >= 0:
            tents += c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)
            print(tents)
        else:
            print(-1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tents` is the final value calculated after executing the loop for each of the `t` inputs. For each input:
    #- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers derived from the input such that `a` is the initial value of `tents`, `b` is the second value, and `c` is the third value.
    #- If `c` is non-negative, `tents` is updated based on the conditions involving `b % 3` and `c`:
    #  - If `b % 3 == 0`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3`.
    #  - If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 2.
    #  - If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
    #- If `c` becomes negative, the loop prints `-1` and stops further updates to `tents`.
    #- If `c` is non-negative at the end of all iterations, `tents` is printed after all the updates.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
