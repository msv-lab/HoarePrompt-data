The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console and does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `tents`, `b`, and `c`. The output of the print statement is displayed but it does not change the state of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user, -1 is printed to the console**
