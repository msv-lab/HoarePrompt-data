According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^4\). Since `t` is given as an input integer and the range is specified, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer and within the specified bounds.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `t` is a positive integer.
2. The value of `t` must be within the range of 1 to \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within this range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\)**
