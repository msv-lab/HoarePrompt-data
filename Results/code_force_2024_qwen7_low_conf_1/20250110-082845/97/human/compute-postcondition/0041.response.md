Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1). If `c` is greater than or equal to 2, `tents` is set to `a + b // 3 + 1` and `c` is set to its original value minus 2. Otherwise, `tents` remains equal to `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user, and -1 is printed to the console.***
