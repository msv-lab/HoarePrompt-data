The code `continue` does not affect the value of any variables; it simply moves to the next iteration of a loop if one is present. Since no loop is specified in the given code snippet, and the `continue` statement is not altering any variables, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `k - 1`, `t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\); `tents` is `a`, `-1` is printed to the console.**
