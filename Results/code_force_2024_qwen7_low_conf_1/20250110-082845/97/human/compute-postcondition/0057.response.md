`t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\), initially equal to `k - 1`, and `tents` is equal to `a`. The code snippet updates `tents` by adding `b // 3` to its current value. Since `b // 3` represents integer division, the new value of `tents` will be the original value of `tents` plus the result of `b // 3`.

Output State: **`t` is `k - 1`, `tents` is `a + b // 3`**
