The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial value of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), but this value is not used in the provided code. After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, while `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the three integers input by the user.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\); `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user**
