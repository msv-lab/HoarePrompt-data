`c` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `t` is `k - 1`, and the initial value of `tents` is `a + (b // 3 + 1)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `k - 1`; `tents` is `a + (b // 3 + 1)`; `c` is `c - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is `k - 1`; `tents` is `a + (b // 3 + 1)`; `c` is `c - 1`.**
