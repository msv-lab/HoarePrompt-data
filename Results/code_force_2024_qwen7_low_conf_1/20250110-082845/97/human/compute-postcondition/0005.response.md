`t` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\); `tents` is `a`; `b` is an integer input by the user and `b` is divisible by 3; `c` is an integer input by the user.

The code snippet is:
```python
tents += b // 3
```

This line of code increments the value of `tents` by the integer division of `b` by 3. Since `b` is divisible by 3, `b // 3` will be an integer.

After executing this line, the value of `tents` is updated to `tents + (b // 3)`.

The output state is: `t` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\); `tents` is `a + b // 3`; `b` is an integer input by the user and `b` is divisible by 3; `c` is an integer input by the user.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\); `tents` is `a + b // 3`; `b` is an integer input by the user and `b` is divisible by 3; `c` is an integer input by the user.**
