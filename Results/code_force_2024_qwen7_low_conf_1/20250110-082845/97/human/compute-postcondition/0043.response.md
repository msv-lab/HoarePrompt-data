`c` is decremented by 1. The initial state tells us that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is `a + (b // 3 + 1)`, and `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved. The value of `c` is updated but `t` and `tents` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is `a + (b // 3 + 1)`, `c` is `c - 1`**
