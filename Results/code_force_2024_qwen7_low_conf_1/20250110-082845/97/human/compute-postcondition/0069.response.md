Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\), `t` is `k - 1`. If `c` is greater than or equal to 2, `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1`, `c` is decremented by 2, and `-1` is not printed. If `c` is greater than or equal to 1, `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1`, `c` is decremented by 1, and `-1` is not printed. If `c` is less than 1, `tents` remains `a` and `-1` is printed to the console.***
