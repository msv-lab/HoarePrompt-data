The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this context, there is no loop present, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user, -1 is printed to the console**
