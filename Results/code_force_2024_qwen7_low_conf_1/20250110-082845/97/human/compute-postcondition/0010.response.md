`c` is decremented by 2. The value of `t` remains a positive integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `tents` remains `a + (b // 3 + 1)` because the code does not affect these variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tents` is `a + (b // 3 + 1)`, `c` is `c - 2`.**
