The code snippet ends with a print statement that outputs `-1` to the console. This means that regardless of the conditions in the previous code, `-1` will be printed. The print statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `tents`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\), `t` is `k - 1`, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `tents` is unchanged, and `-1` is printed to the console.**
