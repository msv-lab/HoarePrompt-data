The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not include a loop, so the `continue` statement does not affect the variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\), `tents` is `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user and not divisible by 3, `b % 3` is equal to 2, and `c` is an integer input by the user, `c` is less than 1, the program prints `-1`**
