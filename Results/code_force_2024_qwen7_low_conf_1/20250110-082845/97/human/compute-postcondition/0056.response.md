`t` is assigned the value of `k - 1`, which means `t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\). The code assigns the value of `a` to the variable `tents`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is `k - 1`, `t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\); `tents` is `a`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user.**
