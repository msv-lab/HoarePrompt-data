The value of `c` is decremented by 2, and the value of `b` remains unchanged as there is no operation performed on it in the given code snippet. The values of `t` and `tents` also remain unchanged since they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is the original value of `c` minus 2.
