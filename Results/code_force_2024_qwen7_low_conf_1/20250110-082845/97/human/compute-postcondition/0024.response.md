Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\). If `c` is greater than or equal to 1 and `b % 3 == 2`, then `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1`, `c` is decreased by 1, and `b` remains not divisible by 3 with `b % 3` equal to 2. If `c` is less than 1, the program prints `-1` and `t` remains unchanged.***
