The code prints `-1`. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `tents`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `k - 1`, `t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\); `tents` is `a`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user**
