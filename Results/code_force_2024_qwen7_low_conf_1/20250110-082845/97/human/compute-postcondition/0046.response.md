Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1). If `c` is greater than or equal to 1, `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3 + 1)`, `c` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tents` remains equal to `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user, and the console displays `-1`***
