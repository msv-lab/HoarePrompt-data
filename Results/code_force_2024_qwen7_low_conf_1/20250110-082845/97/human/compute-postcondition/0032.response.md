Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tents` is determined based on the following rules: 
- If `c >= 0`, `tents` is increased by `c // 3 + 1` if `c % 3 != 0` or by `c // 3` if `c % 3 == 0`.
- If `c < 0`, `tents` remains unchanged.
- `b` is an integer input by the user and its remainder when divided by 3 is preserved.
- `c` is an integer input by the user, which may be decremented if applicable.
- If `c = 0` and `c < 0`, the program prints `-1`. Otherwise, `tents` is printed.***
