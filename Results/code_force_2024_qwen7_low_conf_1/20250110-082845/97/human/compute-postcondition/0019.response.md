`c` is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `c` is an integer input by the user and its value is greater than or equal to 1. After decrementing, `c` will be one less than its original value. The other variables (`t`, `tents`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\), `tents` is `a + b // 3 + 1`, `b` is an integer input by the user and not divisible by 3, `b % 3` is equal to 2, `c` is one less than its original value which is greater than or equal to 1**
