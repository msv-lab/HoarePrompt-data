The code prints `-1`. Since printing does not assign any value to any variable, the only affected aspect is the output itself, and the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\), `tents` is `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user and b is not divisible by 3, the current value of `b` is such that `b % 3 == 1`, `c` is an integer input by the user, `c` is less than 2, print output is -1**
