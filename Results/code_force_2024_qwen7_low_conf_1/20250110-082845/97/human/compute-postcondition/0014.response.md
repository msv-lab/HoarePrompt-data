Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tents` is either `a + (b // 3 + 1)` if `c >= 2`, or `a` if `c < 2`. `b` is an integer input by the user and `b` is not divisible by 3, with `b % 3 == 1`. `c` is an integer input by the user. If `c >= 2`, `c` is updated to `c - 2`; otherwise, `c` remains unchanged and the output is `-1`.***
