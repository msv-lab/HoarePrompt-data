Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tents` is determined as follows:
- If `b` is divisible by 3, then `tents = a + b // 3`.
- If `b` is not divisible by 3:
  - If `c < 0`, then `tents` remains unchanged.
  - If `c = 0`, then `tents` remains unchanged and the program prints `-1`.
- `b` is an integer input by the user and its remainder when divided by 3 is preserved as specified above. `c` is an integer input by the user, which may be decremented if applicable.**
