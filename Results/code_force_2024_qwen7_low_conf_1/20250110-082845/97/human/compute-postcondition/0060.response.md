The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The initial state of `t` being `k - 1`, where `t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\), and `tents` being `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `k - 1`, `t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\); `tents` is `a`, `-1` is printed to the console.**
