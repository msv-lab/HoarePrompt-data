`tents` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of `t`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\); `a` is now assigned to `tents`; `b` is an integer input by the user; `c` is an integer input by the user.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\); `tents` is `a`; `b` is an integer input by the user; `c` is an integer input by the user**
