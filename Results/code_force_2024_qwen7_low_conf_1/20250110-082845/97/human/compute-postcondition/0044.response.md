The code `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `tents`, `b`, or `c`. The only change is that the console will display `-1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user, Console displays `-1`**
