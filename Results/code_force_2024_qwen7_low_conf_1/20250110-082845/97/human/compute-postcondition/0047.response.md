Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user. If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, then `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3 + 1)`, `c` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tents` remains equal to `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user, and the console displays `-1` if the condition `b % 3 == 2` is false and `c >= 1` does not hold.***
