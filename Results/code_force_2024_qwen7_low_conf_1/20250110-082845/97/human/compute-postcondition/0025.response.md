Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tents` is either `a + (b // 3 + 1)` if `c >= 2` and `b % 3 == 1`, or `a` if `c < 2` and `b % 3 == 1`. `b` is an integer input by the user and `b` is not divisible by 3. If `c` is greater than or equal to 1 and `b % 3 == 2`, then `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1`, `c` is decreased by 1, and `b` remains not divisible by 3 with `b % 3` equal to 2. If `c` is less than 1, the program prints `-1` and `t` remains unchanged.***
