The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\), `tents` is `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user and b is not divisible by 3, the current value of `b` is such that `b % 3 == 1`, `c` is an integer input by the user, `c` is less than 2, print output is -1**
