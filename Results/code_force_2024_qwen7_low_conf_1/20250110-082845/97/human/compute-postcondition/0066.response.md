The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `k - 1`, `t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\); `tents` is `a`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user.**
