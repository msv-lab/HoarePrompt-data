`c` is decremented by 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `tents` also remains unchanged because the code only affects `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `k - 1`, `t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\); `tents` is `a + b // 3 + 1`; `c` is `c - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is `k - 1`, `t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\); `tents` is `a + b // 3 + 1`; `c` is `c - 2`**
