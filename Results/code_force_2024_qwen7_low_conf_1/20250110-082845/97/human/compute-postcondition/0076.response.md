The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Each test case consists of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\), representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

Based on the given constraints and the output cases, the function will process these parameters but the specific return value is not directly provided in the problem statement. However, following the format and the structure of the previous example, we can infer that the function might return some result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers within the range \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\), and returns a result based on these parameters.**
