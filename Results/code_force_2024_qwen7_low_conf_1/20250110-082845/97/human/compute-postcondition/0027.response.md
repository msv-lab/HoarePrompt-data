Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `tents` is determined as follows: if `b` is divisible by 3, then `tents = a + b // 3`. If `b` is not divisible by 3, then: - If `c \geq 2` and `b \% 3 == 1`, then `tents = a + (b // 3 + 1)`. - If `c < 2` and `b \% 3 == 1`, then `tents = a`. - If `c \geq 1` and `b \% 3 == 2`, then `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1`, `c` is decreased by 1, and `b` remains not divisible by 3 with `b \% 3` equal to 2. - If `c < 1`, the program prints `-1` and `tents` remains unchanged. `b` is an integer input by the user and its remainder when divided by 3 is preserved as specified above. `c` is an integer input by the user, which may be decremented if applicable. The current value of `c` is non-negative (i.e., `c \geq 0`).***
