Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\), `tents` is updated based on the conditions involving `b % 3` and `c`. If `c >= 0`, `tents` is incremented by `c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)`. Otherwise, `tents` is unchanged and the conditions for `b % 3` and `c` are as follows: if `b % 3 == 0`, `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3)`. If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3) + 1` and `c` is set to `c - 2`. If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3) + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1. If the conditions are not met, `tents` remains equal to `a`, and the console displays `-1`. `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, and `c` is an integer input by the user.***
