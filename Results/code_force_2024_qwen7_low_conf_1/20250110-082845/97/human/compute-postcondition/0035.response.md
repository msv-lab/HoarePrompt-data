`tents` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user.
