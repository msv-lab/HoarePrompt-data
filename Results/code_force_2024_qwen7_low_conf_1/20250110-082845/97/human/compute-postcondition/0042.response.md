`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), so `t` is in the range from 0 to \(10^4 - 1\). `tents` is equal to `a`. `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, so `b % 3` is known but `b` itself is not. The code updates `tents` by adding `b // 3 + 1` to its current value.

Since `b // 3` is the integer division of `b` by 3, and `b % 3` preserves the remainder, we know the following about `b`:
- If `b % 3` is 0, then `b // 3` is `b // 3`.
- If `b % 3` is 1, then `b // 3` is `b // 3`.
- If `b % 3` is 2, then `b // 3` is `b // 3`.

Therefore, `b // 3 + 1` can be simplified to:
- If `b % 3` is 0, then `b // 3 + 1` is `(b // 3) + 1`.
- If `b % 3` is 1 or 2, then `b // 3 + 1` is `(b // 3) + 1`.

Given this, `tents` is updated to `tents + (b // 3 + 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1); `tents` is `a + (b // 3 + 1)`; `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved; `c` is an integer input by the user.**
