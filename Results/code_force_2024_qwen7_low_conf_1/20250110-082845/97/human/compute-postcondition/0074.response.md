Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\), `t` is `k - 1`, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, and `c` remains unchanged. If `c` is less than 0, `-1` is printed to the console. Otherwise, `tents` is updated to either `a + b // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)` or `a` depending on the value of `c`.**
