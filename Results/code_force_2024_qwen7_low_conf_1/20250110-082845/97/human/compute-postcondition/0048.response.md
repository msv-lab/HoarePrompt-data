Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user. Depending on the value of `b % 3` and `c`:
- If `b % 3 == 1`, and `c >= 2`, then `tents` is set to `a + b // 3 + 1` and `c` is set to `c - 2`.
- If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, then `tents` is set to `a + b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `tents` remains equal to `a`, and the console displays `-1` if the corresponding conditions are not met.***
