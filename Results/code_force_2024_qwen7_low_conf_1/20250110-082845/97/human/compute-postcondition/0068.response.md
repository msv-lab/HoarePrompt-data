Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\); `t` is either `k - 1` (if `c` >= 1, then `t` becomes `k - 1` and `tents` becomes `a + (b // 3 + 1)` and `c` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `t` remains `k - 1` and `tents` remains `a`). `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user.***
