Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ `t` ≤ \(10^4\). If `c` is greater than or equal to 1, then `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1`, where `b` is an integer input by the user and not divisible by 3, `b % 3` is equal to 2, and `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is less than 1, the program prints `-1` and `t` remains unchanged.***
