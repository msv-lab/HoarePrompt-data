The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect any variable values but instead causes the loop to skip to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables, the states of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user, Console displays `-1`**
