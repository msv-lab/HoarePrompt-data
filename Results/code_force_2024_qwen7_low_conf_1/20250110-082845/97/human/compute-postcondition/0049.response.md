Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (decremented by 1), `tents` is equal to either `a + (b // 3)` or `a + (b // 3) + 1` depending on the value of `b % 3` and `c`:
- If `b % 3 == 0`, `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3)`.
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3) + 1` and `c` is set to `c - 2`.
- If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3) + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `tents` remains equal to `a`, and the console displays `-1` if the corresponding conditions are not met. `b` is an integer input by the user with its remainder when divided by 3 preserved, `c` is an integer input by the user.***
