`t` is a positive integer between 0 and \(10^4\) and is initially equal to `k - 1`, `tents` is initially equal to `a`. The code updates `tents` by adding to it the value of `b // 3 + 1`. The floor division operator `//` returns the quotient of the division, disregarding the remainder, and then adding 1.

Therefore, the new value of `tents` is `a + (b // 3 + 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is `k - 1`, `tents` is `a + (b // 3 + 1)`**
