Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tents` is the final value calculated after executing the loop for each of the `t` inputs. For each input:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers derived from the input such that `a` is the initial value of `tents`, `b` is the second value, and `c` is the third value.
- If `c` is non-negative, `tents` is updated based on the conditions involving `b % 3` and `c`:
  - If `b % 3 == 0`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3`.
  - If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 2.
  - If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
- If `c` becomes negative, the loop prints `-1` and stops further updates to `tents`.
- If `c` is non-negative at the end of all iterations, `tents` is printed after all the updates.**

This output state captures the final value of `tents` after processing all `t` inputs, considering the conditions specified within the loop.
