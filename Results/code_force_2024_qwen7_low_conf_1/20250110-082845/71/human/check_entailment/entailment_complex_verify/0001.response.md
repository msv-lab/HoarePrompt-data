### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and splits it into lines, extracting the number of test cases `t` and the instructions `s` for each test case.
   - This part is handled correctly and no issues arise here.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' in the string `s`.
   - If the counts of 'N' and 'S' are not equal or the counts of 'E' and 'W' are not equal, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because the instructions cannot be distributed to ensure the rover and helicopter end up at the same point.
   - However, there is a flaw in how the instructions are distributed. The function attempts to prioritize 'N' and 'S' moves to the rover before assigning 'E' and 'W' moves to the rover. This can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

3. **Distribution Logic**:
   - The function incorrectly assigns 'N' and 'S' moves to the rover first and then 'E' and 'W' moves to the rover. This approach fails to ensure that the rover and helicopter can meet at the same point.
   - For example, consider the input "NESSWS". The counts of 'N' and 'S' are equal (both 2), and so are the counts of 'E' and 'W' (both 1). However, if we try to assign all 'N' and 'S' moves to the rover first, the resulting string might be "RRHH", which would place the rover and helicopter at different points (rover at (0,2), helicopter at (0,0)). The correct distribution should allow both to meet at the same point.

4. **Handling Remaining Moves**:
   - After assigning 'N' and 'S' moves to the rover, the function incorrectly assigns any remaining 'N' or 'S' moves to the helicopter, and similarly for 'E' and 'W'.
   - This can again lead to incorrect results. For example, in the case "NSSS", the counts of 'N' and 'S' are equal, but if we assign all 'N' and 'S' moves to the rover first, we get "RR", which places both at (0,0). However, if we were to split the moves differently, we could achieve the correct result.

5. **Test Case Evaluation**:
   - The provided examples show that the current implementation fails to produce the correct results for many test cases. For instance, the test case "NESSWS" should return a valid distribution, but the current implementation fails to find one.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment inaccurately concluded that the program logic handles all cases appropriately. While the counting logic is correct, the distribution logic is flawed and does not ensure that the rover and helicopter can meet at the same point.

### Final:
**False**
