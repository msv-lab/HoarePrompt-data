Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input correctly, splitting it into lines and extracting the necessary information.
2. The `func_1` function checks if the number of north ('N') and south ('S') movements are equal and if the number of east ('E') and west ('W') movements are equal. This is a crucial step because for the rover and helicopter to meet at the same point, they must collectively perform the same number of north-south and east-west moves.
3. If these counts are not equal, the function returns 'NO', indicating that the instructions cannot be distributed to make the rover and helicopter end up at the same point.
4. If the counts are equal, the function proceeds to distribute the instructions. It tries to assign 'N' and 'S' moves to the rover first, followed by 'E' and 'W' moves to the rover. If there are remaining 'N' or 'S' moves after assigning some to the rover, those are assigned to the helicopter. Similarly, for 'E' and 'W' moves.
5. The program constructs the result string and returns it, which is correct based on the logic applied.

Given the above points, the program logic seems to handle all the cases appropriately as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
