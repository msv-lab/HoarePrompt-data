Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and splits it into the necessary parts. This part is accurate and works as intended.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Counts Calculation**: The function correctly counts the occurrences of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' in the string `s`. This step ensures that the total number of north-south and east-west moves are equal, which is a prerequisite for the rover and helicopter to meet.
   - **Condition Check**: If the counts of 'N' and 'S' are not equal or the counts of 'E' and 'W' are not equal, the function returns 'NO'. This is correct and necessary for the logic to work.
   - **Distribution Logic**: The function attempts to distribute the instructions to the rover and helicopter. However, there is a flaw in how the instructions are distributed.
     - The current logic only assigns 'N' and 'S' moves to the rover first and then 'E' and 'W' moves to the rover. This means that all 'N' and 'S' moves are assigned to the rover, and any remaining 'N' or 'S' moves are assigned to the helicopter. Similarly, all 'E' and 'W' moves are assigned to the rover.
     - This approach does not ensure that the rover and helicopter will end up at the same point. For example, if the sequence is "NSNE", the function would return "RRHH" because it assigns all 'N' and 'S' moves to the rover and all 'E' moves to the rover. This would result in the rover being 2 units north and 1 unit east, while the helicopter would be at the origin, leading to a different position for both devices.

3. **Correct Distribution Logic**:
   - To ensure that both the rover and helicopter end up at the same point, we need to distribute the 'N' and 'S' moves evenly between the rover and helicopter, and similarly for 'E' and 'W' moves.
   - We can achieve this by alternating between assigning 'N'/'S' to the rover and helicopter and 'E'/'W' to the rover and helicopter.

4. **Revised Function**:
   - We can modify the function to alternate between assigning 'N'/'S' and 'E'/'W' moves to the rover and helicopter.
   - Here's a revised version of the function:
     ```python
     def func_1(n, s):
         count_north = 0
         count_south = 0
         count_east = 0
         count_west = 0
         for char in s:
             if char == 'N':
                 count_north += 1
             elif char == 'S':
                 count_south += 1
             elif char == 'E':
                 count_east += 1
             else:
                 count_west += 1
         if count_north != count_south or count_east != count_west:
             return 'NO'
         
         result = []
         for i in range(n):
             if s[i] == 'N' or s[i] == 'S':
                 if i % 2 == 0:
                     result.append('R')
                 else:
                     result.append('H')
             elif s[i] == 'E' or s[i] == 'W':
                 if i % 2 == 0:
                     result.append('R')
                 else:
                     result.append('H')
         return ''.join(result)
     ```

Given the above analysis, the original function does not correctly distribute the instructions to ensure that both the rover and helicopter end up at the same point. The revised function addresses this issue by alternating the assignment of 'N'/'S' and 'E'/'W' moves between the rover and helicopter.

Final: **False**
