### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input Correctly:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and splits it into lines. It extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part of the code is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Checking Balance of Movements:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the number of north ('N') and south ('S') movements are equal and if the number of east ('E') and west ('W') movements are equal. This is indeed a crucial step because for the rover and helicopter to meet at the same point, they must collectively perform the same number of north-south and east-west moves. However, there is a critical oversight in the logic.

3. **Handling Imbalanced Movements:**
   - If the counts of 'N' and 'S' or 'E' and 'W' are not equal, the function returns 'NO'. This part of the logic is correct, but it only checks for balance without considering the possibility of redistributing the remaining movements.

4. **Distributing Movements:**
   - The function attempts to distribute the movements to the rover and helicopter. It first assigns 'N' and 'S' moves to the rover, followed by 'E' and 'W' moves to the rover. If there are remaining 'N' or 'S' moves, those are assigned to the helicopter. Similarly, for 'E' and 'W' moves.
   - There is a flaw in the distribution logic. The function does not ensure that the remaining movements can be distributed to make the rover and helicopter end up at the same point. For instance, if there are leftover 'N' or 'S' movements, the function simply assigns them to the helicopter, which may not balance out the overall movement. The same applies to 'E' and 'W'.

5. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The function constructs the result string based on the logic applied. However, due to the flaw in the distribution logic, the constructed string may not always result in the rover and helicopter ending up at the same point.

Given the above points, the program logic does not fully address the problem constraints. Specifically, it fails to properly redistribute the movements to ensure that both the rover and helicopter end up at the same point. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
