You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's imagine the surface of Mars as an infinite coordinate plane. Initially,
the rover Perseverance-2 and the helicopter Ingenuity-2 are located at the
point with coordinates (0, 0) . A set of instructions s consisting of n
instructions of the following types was specially developed for them:

  * N: move one meter north (from point (x, y) to (x, y + 1) ); 
  * S: move one meter south (from point (x, y) to (x, y - 1) ); 
  * E: move one meter east (from point (x, y) to (x + 1, y) ); 
  * W: move one meter west (from point (x, y) to (x - 1, y) ). 

Each instruction must be executed either by the rover or by the helicopter.
Moreover, each device must execute at least one instruction. Your task is to
distribute the instructions in such a way that after executing all n
instructions, the helicopter and the rover end up at the same point, or
determine that this is impossible.

Input

The first line of input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of instructions.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting
of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' — the sequence of instructions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10 ^ 5 .

Output

For each test case, if the required distribution of instructions exists,
output a string p of length n consisting of the characters 'R', 'H'. If the i
-th operation should be executed by the rover, then p_i=\text{R} , if the i
-th operation should be executed by the helicopter, then p_i=\text{H} . If
there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

Otherwise, output NO.

Note

Let's consider the first example: the string S = \texttt{NENSNE} . One of the
possible solutions, shown in the figure below, is p = \texttt{RRHRRH} , using
which both the rover and the helicopter will end up one meter north and one
meter east.

For WWW, the solution is impossible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where the total number of north ('N') and south ('S') movements is odd, or the total number of east ('E') and west ('W') movements is odd. According to the problem description, for the rover and the helicopter to end up at the same point, the number of 'N' and 'S' movements must be equal, and the number of 'E' and 'W' movements must be equal.

Here's an example where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  NNSWE
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program will incorrectly return a distribution of instructions without checking the parity of the counts.

To fix this, the program needs to check the parity of the counts before attempting to distribute the instructions. Here’s how you can modify the `func_1` function to include this check:

```python
def func_1(n, s):
    count_north = 0
    count_south = 0
    count_east = 0
    count_west = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == 'N':
            count_north += 1
        elif char == 'S':
            count_south += 1
        elif char == 'E':
            count_east += 1
        else:
            count_west += 1
    
    # Check if the counts of N and S, and E and W are even
    if (count_north % 2 != 0) or (count_south % 2 != 0) or (count_east % 2 != 0) or (count_west % 2 != 0):
        return 'NO'
    
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i] == 'N' or s[i] == 'S':
            if s[i] == 'N':
                result.append('R')
                count_north -= 1
            else:
                result.append('H')
                count_south -= 1
            i += 1
        elif s[i] == 'E' or s[i] == 'W':
            if s[i] == 'E':
                result.append('R')
                count_east -= 1
            else:
                result.append('H')
                count_west -= 1
            i += 1
    return ''.join(result)
```

This ensures that the program only attempts to distribute the instructions if the counts of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' are even, thus guaranteeing that the rover and the helicopter will end up at the same point if possible.
