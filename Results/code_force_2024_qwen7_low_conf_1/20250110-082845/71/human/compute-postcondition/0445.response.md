Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is 'W', regardless of the if condition, `r` is either 0 or 1, `h` is either 0 or 1, `rr` is a list of four zeros, `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is either `['R']` or `['H']` depending on the execution path of the if-else block. The condition `(ww % 2 == 1)` is false, indicating that `ww` is not odd.***
