`pp` is a list that does not initially exist, and `h` is a variable that has been increased by 1. The code appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` did not exist before, it is created and contains 'H' after the append operation. The value of `h` is not directly affected by this operation but is mentioned in the precondition.

Output State: **`h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
