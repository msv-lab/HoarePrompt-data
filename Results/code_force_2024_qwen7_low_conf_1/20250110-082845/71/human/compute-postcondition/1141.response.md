Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`. If `ss` is True, `pp` is either `['R']` or `['H']` depending on the condition, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'; otherwise, `h` is 3 and `ss` is decreased by 1. If `ss` is False, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. Additionally, if `rr[0]` is True, then `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i` with the last element being 'R', `r` remains as `r + 1`, and `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. If `rr[0]` is False, then if `hh[0]` is True, `pp` is a list containing `'H'`, `r` is 2, and `h` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, and `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. If `r` is less than `h`, then `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i` plus `'H'`, and both `h` and `hh[1]` are incremented by 1.***
