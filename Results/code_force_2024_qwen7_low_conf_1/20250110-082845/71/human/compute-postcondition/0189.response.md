Postcondition: ***`i` is a string, and it is either 'N' or 'S' (not 'E'). If `i` is 'N', `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is adjusted based on the parity of `r` and the value of `nn`, and `nn` is updated. If `nn` is true and `r` is odd, `h` is increased by 1; if `nn` is true and `r` is even, `h` is increased by 1; if `nn` is false, `h` remains unchanged. `r` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1 if `ss` is true, and `pp` is updated accordingly. If `ss` is true, `pp` is ['H']; if `ss` is false, `pp` remains the same. `rr[0]` and `hh[0]` are updated based on the value of `rr[1]` and `hh[1]`, and `rr[1]` is 1 if `ss` is true and `hh[1]` is True; otherwise, `rr[1]` is 1 and `hh[1]` is True. The state of other variables remains the same.***
