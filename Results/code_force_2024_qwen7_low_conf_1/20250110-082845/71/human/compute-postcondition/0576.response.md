To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following points:

1. The loop iterates over each character in the string `l`.
2. The variable `i` takes the value of the current character being processed in the loop.
3. Since the last character in the string `l` is not 'E', `i` cannot be 'E' for the current iteration.

Given the constraints and conditions provided:

- If `i` is 'W':
  - `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1.
  - `ww` is either 0, -1, or not odd (since it's not the last character and `ww` is only updated when `i` is 'N' or 'S').
  - `rr` is either a list of four zeros, `[0, 0, 0, -1]`, or `[0, 0, 1, 0]`.

- If `i` is 'N':
  - `r` and `h` are updated based on specific conditions.
  - `pp` is a list containing either 'R' or 'H' or is an empty list with the additional element 'H'.

- If `i` is 'S':
  - `r` and `h` are determined based on specific conditions.
  - `pp` is updated accordingly.

Since `i` is not 'E', we need to consider the possible values for `i` ('W', 'N', 'S') and adjust the states accordingly. 

Let's assume the current last character `i` is not 'E' but could be 'W', 'N', or 'S'. For simplicity, let's assume `i` could be 'W' as per the constraints given.

### Step-by-step Adjustment of States:

1. **Character `i` is 'W':**
   - `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1.
   - `ww` is either 0, -1, or not odd.
   - `rr` is either `[0, 0, 0, -1]`, `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, or `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

2. **Next Character `i`:**
   - `t` remains at least 2.
   - `m` remains the integer input by the user.
   - `l` loses the last character, making it one character shorter.
   - `nn` remains the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`.
   - `ss` remains the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`.
   - `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i` ('W', 'N', or 'S').
   - `ee` remains `e - w`.
   - `i` becomes the new last character of the shortened string `l`.
   - `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1, updated based on the new `i`.
   - `rr` and `hh` are lists of four integers.

### Adjusted State:

State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character (now shorter by one), `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the new last character in the string `l`, `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1, `rr` is a list of four integers, and `hh` is a list of four integers.**
