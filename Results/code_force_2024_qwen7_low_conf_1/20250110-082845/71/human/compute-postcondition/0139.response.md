`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains a string and is not equal to 'E', specifically it is 'N'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string, `i` is not equal to 'E' and the current value of `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is False, `hh[1]` is False, `h` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is a string, `i` is not equal to 'E' and the current value of `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is False, `hh[1]` is False, `h` is increased by 1**
