`pp` is a list to which the value 'H' is appended. The value of `hh[1]` is updated to the value it had before - 1, and `h` is increased by 1. After appending 'H' to `pp`, the output state is: `hh[1]` is the value it had before - 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.

Output State: **`hh[1]` is the value it had before - 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
