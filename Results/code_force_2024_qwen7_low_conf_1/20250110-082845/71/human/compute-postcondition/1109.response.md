`pp` appends the string `'H'` to the list. Since `pp` was adjusted based on the value of `i`, and `i` is the next character in `l`, the specific change to `pp` is appending `'H'` to the list. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list with the value `'H'` appended to it, `r` is incremented by 1, `hh` is the same list with its second element decreased by 1, `h` is increased by 1**
