Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is incremented by 1 under certain conditions, and `pp` is a list containing either 'R' or 'H' depending on the conditions.**

- If `i == 'E'`:
  - `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R' if `ee` is odd, otherwise `pp` is a list containing 'H'.
  
- If `i == 'N'`:
  - If `nn` was 0, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is `['R']` if `rr[1]` is true, otherwise `pp` is `['H']` if `hh[1]` is true, otherwise `pp` is a list containing one element `'R'` if `r < h`, otherwise `pp` is a list containing one element `'H'`.
  - If `nn` was 1, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is `['R']` if `nn` was 1 before decrementing, otherwise `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is `['H']`.
  
- If `i != 'N'`:
  - If `ss % 2 == 1` (now either `(nn - 2) % 2 == 1` or `-1 % 2 == 1`), then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`.
  - Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`.
  - If `rr[0]` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing `'R'`.
  - Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing `'H'`, unless `r < h`, in which case `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing `'R'`, or `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is incremented by 1 with `pp` being `['H']`.
