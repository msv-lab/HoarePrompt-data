Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `m` is `user_input`, `l` is a non-empty sequence, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `nn` is the final count of 'N' in `l` after processing, `ss` is the final count of 'S' in `l` after processing, `ww` is the final count of 'W' in `l` after processing, `ee` is the final count of 'E' in `l` after processing. If the condition `(nn % 2 == 1 or ss % 2 == 1 or ww % 2 == 1 or (ee % 2 == 1))` is true, then `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, and `ee` are as initially described. Otherwise, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, and `ee` are processed according to the else part, where `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, and `ee` are updated based on specific conditions involving `r` and `h`.**
