The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The value of `r` was previously `r`, and now it becomes `r + 1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `r` is `r + 1`, `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` may change in terms of its contents, `rr[2]` is decreased by 1, `hh` may change in terms of its values.**
