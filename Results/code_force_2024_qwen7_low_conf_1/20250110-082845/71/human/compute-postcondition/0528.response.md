`r` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `r` is `1 + r`. The previous value of `r` is less than `h`, and now `r` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is 'N', `r` is 1 + `r`, `h` is 0, `rr` is a list `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is a list of four zeros with the second element being `False`, `pp` is an empty list, and the last character in the string `l` is not 'E'.**
