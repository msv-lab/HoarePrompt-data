`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character (now shorter by one), `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the new last character in the string `l`, `r` is increased by 1, `h` is either 0 or 1, `pp` is a list containing `'R'`, and `rr` is a list of four integers where the first element is now `rr[0] = x - 1`, and `hh` is a list of four integers.**
