Postcondition: **`i` is a string. If `i == 'W'`:
- `r` is either `r_initial + 1` or remains unchanged, `pp` is either `[<previous pp content>, 'R']` or contains the element `'H'`, `h` is incremented by 1, and `hh` and `rr` are lists. If `ww` is true, `r` and `pp` remain as per the conditions mentioned. If `ww` is false and `hh[3]` is truthy, `hh[3]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` becomes ['H']. If `ww` is false and `rr[3]` is true and `r >= h`, `rr[2]` is increased by 2, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1, and `pp` remains ['H'].
- If `i` is 'E', `ee` is a boolean, `h`, `pp`, `r`, `rr`, and `hh` are updated based on the value of `ee` and the conditions specified. If `i` is 'N', `nn` is an integer, `r`, `h`, and `pp` are updated based on the value of `nn` and the conditions specified. If `i` is 'S', `ss` is an integer, `r`, `pp`, `hh[0]`, and `hh[1]` are updated based on the initial value of `ss` and the comparison between `r` and `h`.**
