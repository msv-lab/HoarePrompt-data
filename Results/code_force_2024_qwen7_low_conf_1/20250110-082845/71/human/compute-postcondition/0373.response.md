Postcondition: **`ss` is an integer. If `ss` was initially odd, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is `['R']`, `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, and `h` is increased by 1. If `ss` was initially even, then `rr[0]` is checked: if true, `rr[0]` is decremented by 1, `r` is its previous value + 1, `pp` is `['R']`, `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `hh` is updated to `[hh[0], ...]` with `pp` set to `['H']`. If `rr[0]` is false and `r < h`, then `hh[1]` is set to `x + 2`, `r` is set to `x + 1`, and `pp` remains as `[ 'R' ]`. If `r` is not less than `h`, then `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.**
