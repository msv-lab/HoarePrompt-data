`e` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `e` is the original value of `e` plus 1. The original value of `e` can be either 1 or 0. Therefore, the new value of `e` is either 2 (if originally 1) or 1 (if originally 0). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is either 1 or 0, `s` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is 'S', `w` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is 'W', `e` is either 2 (if originally 1) or 1 (if originally 0), `nn` is the final count of 'N' in `l` after processing, `ss` is the final count of 'S' in `l` after processing, `ww` is the final count of 'W' in `l` after processing, `ee` is the final count of 'E' in `l` after processing, and `i` is the next character in the string `l`.**
