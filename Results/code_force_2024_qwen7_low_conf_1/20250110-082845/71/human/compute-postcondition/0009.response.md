The code `count_south += 1` increments the value of `count_south` by 1. Given that the initial state of `count_south` is 0, after this operation, `count_south` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` is 0, `count_south` is 1, `count_east` is 0, `count_west` is 0, the character `char` in `s` is 'S'**
