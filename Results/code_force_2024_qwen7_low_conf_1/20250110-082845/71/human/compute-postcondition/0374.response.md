Postcondition: ***`ss` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `pp` is either `['R']` or `[ 'R' ]`, `hh` is a list of at least two elements, `h` is an integer. If `i == 'S'` and `ss` is initially odd, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is `['R']`, `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, and `h` is increased by 1. If `ss` is initially even, then depending on the value of `rr[0]` and the comparison between `r` and `h`, `r`, `pp`, `hh[0]`, `h`, and `hh` may be updated accordingly. If `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is `['R']`, `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1. If `rr[0]` is false and `r < h`, `hh[1]` is set to `x + 2`, `r` is set to `x + 1`, and `pp` remains `['R']`. If `r` is not less than `h`, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.***
