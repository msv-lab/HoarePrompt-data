`pp` is appended with the value 'R', which was not initially defined in the initial state. The fourth element of `rr` is decreased by 1, and `r` is increased by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `rr` is a list where the fourth element (index 3) is now one less than its original value; `r` is now one more than its original value; `pp` is a list containing the value 'R'.

Output State: **`rr` is a list where the fourth element (index 3) is one less than its original value; `r` is one more than its original value; `pp` is ['R']**
