Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`. If `hh[2]` is true, then `hh[2]` is reduced by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` now contains the elements it previously had plus `'H'`. If `hh[2]` is false, then if `r < h`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is now a list containing the elements from the original `pp` plus the string `'R'`, `rr[3]` is increased by 1, and `h` may change based on the value of `i`. Otherwise, `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is the original `pp` with `'H'` appended, `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1. `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values.***
