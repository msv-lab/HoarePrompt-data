`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The values of `hh[2]` and `h` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh[2]` is increased by 1; `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`hh[2]` is increased by 1; `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is ['H']**
