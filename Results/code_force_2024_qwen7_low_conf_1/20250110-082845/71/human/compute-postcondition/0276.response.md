`pp` is appended with the value 'H'. The value of `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh[1]` is incremented by 1; `h` is incremented by 1; `pp` contains one more element which is 'H'.

Output State: **`hh[1]` is incremented by 1; `h` is incremented by 1; `pp` contains 'H'**
