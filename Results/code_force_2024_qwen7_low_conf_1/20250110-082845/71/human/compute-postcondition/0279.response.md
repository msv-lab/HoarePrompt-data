Postcondition: **`rr` and `hh` are lists, `r` and `h` are integers, and `pp` is a list. If `rr[0]` is `v - 1`, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, and `x` is 0, then `total` remains positive, `num` remains negative, `x` remains 0, `r` is 1, `pp` contains `'R'`, and `rr[0]` remains `v - 1`. If `hh[0]` is true, then `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is set to `['H']`, and the rest of the elements in `hh` remain unchanged. If `hh[0]` is false, then either `rr[1]` is set to `v + 1`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']` if `r < h`; or `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains `['H']` if `r >= h`.**
