`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The values of `rr[0]` and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `rr[0]` is `some_value + 1`; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is now a list containing the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`rr[0]` is `some_value + 1`; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is ['R']**
