`pp` is a list that now has the element 'R' appended to it. The value of `r` is increased by 1 as per the initial state, but no further information about `r` is given in the code execution. Therefore, the only updated information is that `pp` now contains the element 'R'.

Output State: **`r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing 'R'**
