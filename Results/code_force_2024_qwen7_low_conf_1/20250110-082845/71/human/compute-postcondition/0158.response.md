`r` is incremented by 1, and its new value is `r + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `ss` is true and its value is an odd number also remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E', `r` is `r + 1`, `ss` is true and the value of `ss` is an odd number.**
