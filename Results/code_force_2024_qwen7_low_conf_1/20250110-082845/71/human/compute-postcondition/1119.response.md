Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list with either `'H'` or `'R'` appended to it. `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', otherwise `h` may be incremented by 1. If `nn` is even, `pp` is a list containing elements adjusted based on the value of `i` (plus the string `'H'` if applicable) or `['R']`. If `nn` is odd, `pp` is either a list with `'H'` or `'R'` appended to it. `hh` is the same list with its second element decreased by 1 if `hh[1]` is true, otherwise `hh` remains unchanged, and `rr[0]` is increased by 1 if `rr[1]` is true, otherwise `rr[1]` is decreased by 1.***
