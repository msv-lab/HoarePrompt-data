`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The previous value of `pp` was adjusted based on the value of `i`, but this operation does not affect the existing elements of `pp`; it only adds a new element to the list. Therefore, the only change is the addition of `'R'` to the list `pp`.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is equal to the previous value of `pp` plus the string `'R'`, `r` is the initial value of `r` + 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[2]` is decreased by 1.**
