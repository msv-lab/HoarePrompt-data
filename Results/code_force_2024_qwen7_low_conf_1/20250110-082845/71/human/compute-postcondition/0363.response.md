The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not mentioned in the initial state, it is initialized as an empty list before this operation. The other variables `hh[0]`, `h`, and `hh` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hh[0]` is `hh[0] - 1`, `h` is `h + 1`, `hh` is `[hh[0], ...]`, `pp` is `['H']`**
