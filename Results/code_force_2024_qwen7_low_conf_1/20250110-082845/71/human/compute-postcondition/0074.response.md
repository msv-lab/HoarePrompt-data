`i` is incremented by 1, but the initial values of `n`, `s`, `result`, `count_east`, and `count_west` remain unchanged. The only affected variable is `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `s` is a string, `result` is either ['R'] or ['H'], `count_east` is one less than its initial value if `s[i-1] == 'E'`, otherwise `count_west` is `count_west - 1`, and `i` is increased by 1.**
