The code `result.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `result`. Since the initial state does not specify what `result` is, we assume it is an empty list initially. After executing the code, the list `result` will contain the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3; `result` is ['R']**
