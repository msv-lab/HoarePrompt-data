The initial state indicates that `hh[3]` is incremented by 1. The code snippet `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since there is no direct relationship between `hh[3]` and `h` in the given information, the only change is that `h` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`hh[3]` is equal to its previous value + 1, `h` is incremented by 1**
