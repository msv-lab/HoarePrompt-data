`ss` is decremented by 1. If `ss` was initially an odd number, it is now even (since subtracting 1 from an odd number makes it even). This changes the condition that determined the values of `r` and `pp`. Initially, if `ss` was odd, `r` was incremented by 1 and `pp` contained `['R']`. Now, since `ss` is even, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains `['H']`.

Output State: **`i` is 'S' and is not equal to 'N' and 'E', `ss` is one less than its original value and is now even, `r` is unchanged, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains ['H']**
