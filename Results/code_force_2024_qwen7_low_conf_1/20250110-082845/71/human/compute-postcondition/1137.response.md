The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was previously adjusted based on the value of `i`, the only direct change here is adding `'H'` to the list. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `r`, `h`, and `hh[1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list containing elements adjusted based on the value of `i` plus `'H'`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[1]` is increased by 1**
