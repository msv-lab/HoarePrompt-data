Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`. If `ww % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains `'R'`, and `h` may change based on the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pp` is now a list containing one more element `H`, and `h` is incremented by 1. `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values.***
