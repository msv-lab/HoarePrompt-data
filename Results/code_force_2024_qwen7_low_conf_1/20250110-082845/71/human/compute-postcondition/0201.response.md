`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The initial state specifies that `rr[3]` is `rr[3] - 1`, the rest of the elements in `rr` remain the same, and `r` is increased by 1. These conditions are not affected by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`rr[3]` is `rr[3] - 1`, the rest of the elements in `rr` remain the same, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'` appended to its previous contents.**
