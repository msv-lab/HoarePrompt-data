`r` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `r` is not specified, let's denote it as `r_initial`. After executing `r += 1`, the value of `r` becomes `r_initial + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`r` is `r_initial + 1`, other variables remain unchanged**
