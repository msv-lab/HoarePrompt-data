The code `count_east += 1` increments the value of `count_east` by 1. Since `count_east` was previously 0, it now becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `count_north`, `count_south`, and `char`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` is 0, `count_south` is 0, `count_east` is 1, `count_west` is 0, the character `char` in `s` is 'E'**
