`hh[0]` is decremented by 1. Initially, `hh[0]` is `True`. Since `True` is equivalent to `1` in numerical operations in Python, decrementing `True` by `1` results in `0`. After the operation, `hh[0]` will be `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string, and `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E'; `hh[0]` is False**
