The code appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before the code execution. After appending 'R', the list `pp` becomes `['R']`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `i` is not 'N' and 'E', `rr[0]` is False, `rr[1]` is 1, `hh[0]` is False, `r` is equal to its original value plus 1 and is still less than `h`, `pp` is `['R']**
