Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is 'N', `r` and `h` are integers, `rr` is a list of four integers, and `hh` is a list of four integers. If `hh[1]` is `True`, then `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, and `hh` is a list of four zeros with the second element being `False`. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `r` is 1 + `r`, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, and `hh` is a list of four zeros with the second element being `False`. Otherwise, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, `h` is 1, `rr` is a list of four zeros, and `hh` is a list of four integers with the first element being `1` and the second element being `False`. `pp` is either a list containing `'R'` or an empty list with the additional element `'H'`. The last character in the string `l` is not 'E'.**
