Postcondition: ***`hh` and `r` are integers, `h` is an integer, and `pp` is a list. If `hh[0]` is true, then `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh` is updated to `[hh[0], ...]`, and `pp` is set to `['H']`. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `hh[1]` is set to `x + 2`, `r` is set to `x + 1`, and `pp` remains as `[ 'R' ]`. If `r` is not less than `h`, then `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.***
