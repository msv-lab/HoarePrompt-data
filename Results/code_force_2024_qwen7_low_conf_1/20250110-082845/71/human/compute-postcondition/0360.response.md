The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `pp`, we assume `pp` is initially an empty list. After appending `'R'`, `pp` will contain the single element `'R'`.

The values of `rr[0]` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`rr[0]` is the value of its previous value - 1; `r` is its previous value + 1; `pp` is ['R']**
