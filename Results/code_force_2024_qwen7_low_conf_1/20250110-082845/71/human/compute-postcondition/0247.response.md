`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `hh[1]` is the value it was before minus 1, but since no direct assignment to `hh[1]` is made, the value of `hh[1]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh[1]` is the value it was before - 1; `h` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`hh[1]` is the value it was before - 1; `h` is increased by 1**
