Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0 or -1, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is 'W', `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, -1]`, `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is `['R']`, and `hh[3]` is False if `rr[3]` is -1, otherwise `rr` is a list of four zeros or [0, 0, 1, 0], `hh` is a list of four zeros or [0, 0, 1, 0], `pp` is an empty list, ['R'], or ['H'].***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that the state of all relevant variables is described accurately based on whether the condition `rr[3]` is true (equal to -1) or false.
