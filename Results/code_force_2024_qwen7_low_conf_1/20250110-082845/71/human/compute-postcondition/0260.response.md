`pp` is appended with the value 'R', and the value of `r` is increased by 1. Since the initial state only mentions that `r` is increased by 1 and does not specify an initial value, the output state will reflect that `r` has been incremented and `pp` has been modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing 'R'.

Output State: **`r` is increased by 1; `pp` is ['R']**
