Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n`; `i` is incremented by 1; if the character at index `i` is 'E', then `count_east` is incremented by 1, while `count_north`, `count_south`, and `count_west` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `count_west` is incremented by 1.***
