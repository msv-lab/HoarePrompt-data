Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is a string, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0 or the difference between the total count of 'W' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l` depending on whether `w > e` or not, `ee` is `e - w` or 0 depending on whether `w > e` or not, and `i` is the last character in the string `l`. The current value of `nn` satisfies `nn % 2 == 1` or the current value of `ss` satisfies `ss % 2 == 1` or the current value of `ww` satisfies `ww % 2 == 1` or the current value of `ee` satisfies `ee % 2 == 1`**
