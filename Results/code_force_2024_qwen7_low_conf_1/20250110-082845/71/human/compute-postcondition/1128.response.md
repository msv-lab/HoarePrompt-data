The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is 2
- `i` is the next character in `l`
- `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`
- `r` is original r + 1
- `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'
- `rr` is a list where the first element is decremented by 1

Since `pp.append('R')` only affects `pp`, the value of `pp` will now include `'R'` as its last element. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i` with the last element being 'R', `r` is original r + 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', and `rr` is a list where the first element is decremented by 1.**
