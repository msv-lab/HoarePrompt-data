The code `pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The initial state of `pp` is an empty list. After appending `'R'`, `pp` becomes `['R']`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is not zero and is currently odd, the current value of `i` is 'E', `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is a list of four zeros, `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is ['R'], and the last character in the string `l` is not 'W'.**
