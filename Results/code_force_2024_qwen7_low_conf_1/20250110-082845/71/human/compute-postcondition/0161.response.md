`h` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is a string equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E'. The condition `ss` is not true or `ss` is even. These conditions and the value of `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E', `h` is increased by 1, and the condition `ss` is not true or `ss` is even.**
