The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Since the initial state only mentions the value of `h`, and does not provide any information about `pp`, the value of `h` remains unchanged. The list `pp` now includes the element 'H'.

Output State: **`h` is its original value plus 1; `pp` is ['H']**
