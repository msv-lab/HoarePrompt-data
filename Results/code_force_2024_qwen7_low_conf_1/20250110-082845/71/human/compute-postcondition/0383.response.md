Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `m` is `user_input`, `l` is a non-empty sequence, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `nn` is the final count of 'N' in `l` after processing, `ss` is the final count of 'S' in `l` after processing, `ww` is the final count of 'W' in `l` after processing, `ee` is the final count of 'E' in `l` after processing, `rr` is a list containing the final counts of different conditions related to 'W', `hh` is a list containing the final counts of different conditions related to 'E', `r` is the final count of 'R' in `l` after processing, `h` is the final count of 'H' in `l` after processing, `pp` is a list containing the final occurrences of 'R' and 'H' in `l` after processing. If both `r` and `h` are non-zero, the function processes the sequence `l` accordingly. If either `r` or `h` is zero, the function does not process the sequence `l` in the same way.**
