Postcondition: **`hh` and `rr` are lists, `h` and `r` are integers, and `pp` is a list. If `hh[0]` is true, then `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is set to `['H']`, and the rest of the elements in `hh` remain unchanged. If `hh[0]` is false, then either `rr[1]` is set to `v + 1`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']` if `r < h`; or `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains `['H']` if `r >= h`.**
