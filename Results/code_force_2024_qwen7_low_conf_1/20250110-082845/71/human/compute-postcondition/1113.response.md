The code snippet `hh[0] += 1` increments the first element of the list `hh` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `hh`. Since no specific value for `hh` is given, we cannot determine the exact value after the increment. But we know that the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1.

Other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, `r`, and `h`) are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `hh`'s first element is incremented by 1.**
