`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not specified initially, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'`, the list `pp` will contain `'R'`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `r`, and `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is ['R'], `r` is 3, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'**
