`result` is a list that gets an element appended to it. Initially, it contains an unspecified number of elements (at least one, because `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3). After executing `result.append('R')`, the list `result` will have one more element, which is `'R'`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3; `result` is a list containing at least one element, now it contains one more element which is `'R'`.**
