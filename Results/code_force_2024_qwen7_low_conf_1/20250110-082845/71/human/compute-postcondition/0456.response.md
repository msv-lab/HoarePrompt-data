The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Initially, `pp` is an empty list. After appending `'H'`, `pp` becomes a list containing `'H'`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is 'W', `r` is 0, `h` is 1, `rr` is a list of four zeros, `hh[3]` is 0, `pp` is a list containing `'H'`, and the value of `hh[3]` is False.**
