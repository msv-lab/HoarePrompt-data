The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Initially, `pp` is an empty list. After appending `'R'`, `pp` becomes `['R']`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 1, False]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` with the last element being False, `pp` is `['R']`, and the condition `r < h` is now false since `r` is 1 and `h` is 0.
