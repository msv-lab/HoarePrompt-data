The value of `w` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `w` is 1 if `i` is 'W' and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the new value of `w` is 2 if `i` is 'W' and 1 otherwise. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string (or an empty string if it was empty before), `t` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `nn` is the integer, `ss` is the integer, `ww` is the integer, `ee` is the integer, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is 1 if `i` is 'N', `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S' and 0 otherwise, `w` is 2 if `i` is 'W' and 1 otherwise, `e` is 0, `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, `pp` is an empty list.**
