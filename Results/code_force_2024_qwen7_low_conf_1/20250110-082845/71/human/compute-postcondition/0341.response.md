`pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. The value of `hh[1]` is `val - 1`, `hh` remains a list with at least two elements, and `h` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh[1]` is `val - 1`, `hh` is a list with at least two elements, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing the element 'H'.

Output State: **`hh[1]` is `val - 1`, `hh` is a list with at least two elements, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing the element 'H'**
