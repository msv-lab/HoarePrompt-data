`count_north` is decremented by 1. The value of `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` was equal to `count_south` and `count_east` was equal to `count_west`, `result` is `['R']`, and `i` is 1. After executing `count_north -= 1`, the value of `count_north` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` is `count_north - 1`, `count_south` equals `count_north`, `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` is `['R']`, `i` is 1**
