`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`) or 0, `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is the original value of `r` + 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` with the first element being 0, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is an empty list with the addition of `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`) or 0, `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is the original value of `r` + 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` with the first element being 0, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is ['R']**
