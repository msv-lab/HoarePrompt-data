The code appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify that `pp` is a list, we assume it is initially an empty list. After appending 'R', `pp` will contain ['R']. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `r`, and `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is ['R'], `r` is 2, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'**
