Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` and `h` either both are the sum of all increments (true) and the console outputs `pp` joined as a string, or both are set to 0 and the program prints 'NO'. `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` are the total decrements, `pp` is a list of 'R' and 'H' based on the conditions met during the loop, and `rr` and `hh` are arrays reflecting the number of times specific conditions were met.***
