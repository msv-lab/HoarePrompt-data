`pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify what `pp` is, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'H'`, the list `pp` will contain one element, which is `'H'`.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is ['H'], `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is 3, `hh[3]` is increased by 1**
