`pp` is a list that gets an element appended to it, specifically 'R'. The value of `i` remains a string and is not equal to 'E', and it is specifically 'N'. The value of `r` is increased by 1, and `rr[1]` remains false. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string, `i` is 'N', `r` is increased by 1, `rr[1]` is false, and `pp` is a list containing 'R'.

Output State: **`i` is a string, `i` is 'N', `r` is increased by 1, `rr[1]` is false, `pp` is ['R']**
