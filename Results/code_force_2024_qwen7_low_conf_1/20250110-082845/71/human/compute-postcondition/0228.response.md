`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `rr[3]` is already increased by 1, so it is now `rr[3] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `rr[3]` is now `rr[3] + 1`; `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`rr[3]` is now `rr[3] + 1`; `r` is increased by 1**
