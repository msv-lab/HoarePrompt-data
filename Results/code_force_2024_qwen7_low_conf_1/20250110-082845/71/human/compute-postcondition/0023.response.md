Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'. If the current character is 'E', `count_east` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_west` is increased by 1, and `count_north` and `count_south` are updated based on the current character.***
