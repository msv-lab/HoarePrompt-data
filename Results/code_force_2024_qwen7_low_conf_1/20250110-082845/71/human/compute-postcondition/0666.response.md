Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` has at least one character (now shorter by one), `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the new last character in the string `l`, `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1, `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'`, `rr` is a list of four integers, and `hh` is a list of four integers. If `i == 'N'` and `nn % 2 == 1`, then `pp` has an additional element `'R'`. If `i == 'N'` and `rr[1]` is true, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'R'`. If `i == 'N'` and `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'H'`. If `i == 'N'` and `r < h`, then `r` is 1 more than its original value and `pp` contains `'R'`; otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `hh[0]` is increased by 1. If `i == 'S'`, then if `(ss - 1) % 2 == 1`, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` has an additional element `'R'`. If `i == 'S'` and `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, the first element of `rr` is `rr[0] = x - 1`, and `pp` contains `'R'`. If `i == 'S'` and `hh[0]` is true, the second element of `hh` remains unchanged, and `pp` contains `'H'`. If `i` is neither 'N' nor 'S', no changes are made to `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, or `hh`.***
