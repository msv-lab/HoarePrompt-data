Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the last character in the string `l`, `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1 or are integers based on the conditions specified in the if and else parts, `rr` is a list of four integers, and `hh` is a list of four integers. If `i` is 'N', then `r` and `h` are updated based on the conditions in the if part, and `pp` is a list containing either 'R' or 'H' or is an empty list with the additional element 'H'. If `i` is 'S', then `r` and `h` are determined based on the conditions in the else part, and `pp` is updated accordingly. The last character in the string `l` is not 'E'.***
