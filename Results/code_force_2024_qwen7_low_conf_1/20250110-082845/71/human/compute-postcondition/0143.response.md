`rr[0]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `rr[0]` is not specified, but since it is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was 0 before the operation. After incrementing, `rr[0]` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a string, `i` is not equal to 'E' and the current value of `i` is 'N', `rr[0]` is 1, `rr[1]` is False, the value of `hh[1]` is False, and the current value of `r` is less than the current value of `h`**
