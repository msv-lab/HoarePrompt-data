The code appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined, it will be created as an empty list before the append operation. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 'E', `rr[2]` is False, `hh[2]` is False, `hh[3]` is `hh[3] + 1`, `h` is `h + 1`, `pp` is `['H']`**
