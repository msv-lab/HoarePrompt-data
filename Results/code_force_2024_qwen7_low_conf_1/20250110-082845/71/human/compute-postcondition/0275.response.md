`h` is incremented by 1, and `hh[1]` is already incremented by 1 in the initial state. The value of `hh[1]` is now one more than its original value, and `h` is now one more than its original value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`hh` is the same list as before but with `hh[1]` incremented by 1; `h` is incremented by 1**
