Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`) or 0, `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`. If `rr[0]` is true, then `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 1, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` with `(hh[0])` being False, and `pp` is `['R']`. Otherwise, `r` is 0, `h` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 1, 0, 0]` with `(hh[0])` being False, and `pp` is `['H']`.***
