`pp` is a list, and the code appends the string `'H'` to it. The value of `hh[3]` is updated to its previous value plus 1, and `h` is incremented by 1. The output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`hh[3]` is equal to its previous value + 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing the elements ['H']**
