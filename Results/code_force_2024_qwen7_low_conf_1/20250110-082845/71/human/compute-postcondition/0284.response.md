Postcondition: ***`ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` are as follows: 
- If `i == 'W'` and `ww` is true, then `r` and `h` are incremented, and `pp` is updated according to whether `ww` was even or odd. If `r < h` after the increment, `rr[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains an additional 'R'. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1.
- If `i == 'W'` and `ww` is false, then `r` and `h` are incremented, `rr[3]` and `hh[3]` are incremented, and `pp` is updated according to whether `ww` was even or odd.
- If `i == 'E'`, then `r` and `h` are incremented under specific conditions involving `ee`, `rr[2]`, and the comparison between `r` and `h`. `pp` is updated accordingly, and `rr[3]` and `hh[3]` are incremented.
- If `i != 'W'` and `i != 'E'`, then `h` is incremented and `hh[3]` is incremented, while `r`, `pp`, and `rr` remain unchanged.***
