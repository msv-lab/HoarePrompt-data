The value of `hh` is a list where the third element (`hh[2]`) is increased by 1. The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since `h` is the third element of the list `hh`, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `hh` is a list where the third element is increased by 1; `hh[2]` is now `hh[2] + 1`.

Output State: **`hh` is a list where the third element is increased by 1; `hh[2]` is now `hh[2] + 1`**
