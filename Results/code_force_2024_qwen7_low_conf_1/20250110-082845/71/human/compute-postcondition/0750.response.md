The code snippet appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. This operation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the values of the other variables, except for `pp`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `r` is increased by 1, `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is a list with an additional element `'R'` appended to it, `rr` is a list with the second element incremented by 1, and `hh` may change in terms of its values.**
