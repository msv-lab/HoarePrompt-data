The code snippet `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The value of `pp` was previously adjusted based on the value of `i`, but since no specific value of `i` is mentioned, we only know that `pp` contains the value adjusted by `i`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `r`, and `h`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is the list adjusted by `i` with an additional element `'H'`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is its original value plus 1**
