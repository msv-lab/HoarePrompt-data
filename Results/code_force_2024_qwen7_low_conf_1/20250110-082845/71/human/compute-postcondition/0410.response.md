Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is a non-empty string, `nn` is the final count of 'N' in `l` after processing, `ss` is the final count of 'S' in `l` after processing, `ww` is the final count of 'W' in `l` after processing, `ee` is the final count of 'E' in `l` after processing, and `i` is the next character in the string `l`. If `i` is 'N', `n` is 3. Otherwise, `n` is either 1 or 0, `s` is 3 if the character `i` is 'S' and 1 if the character `i` is not 'S', `w` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'W', and `e` is set to 2 if `i` is 'W' and 1 if `i` is not 'W'.***
