`pp` is appended with the string 'H', which means a new element 'H' is added to the list `pp`. The variables `h` and `hh[2]` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is increased by 1; `hh[2]` is decreased by 1; `pp` is a list containing at least one element 'H'.

Output State: **`h` is increased by 1; `hh[2]` is decreased by 1; `pp` is a list containing 'H'**
