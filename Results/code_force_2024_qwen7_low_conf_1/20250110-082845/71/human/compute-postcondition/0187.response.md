Postcondition: ***`i` is 'S' and is not equal to 'N' or 'E'. If `ss` is true, then `ss` is one less than its original value and is now even, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains ['H']. If `ss` is false, then `r` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `rr[0]` is True, then `rr[1]` is 1, `hh[0]` is False, and `hh[1]` is True. If `rr[0]` is False, then `rr[1]` is 1, `hh[0]` is False, and `hh[1]` is True. The state of `pp` remains as `['R']` or `['H']` depending on the condition, and the state of other variables remains the same.***
