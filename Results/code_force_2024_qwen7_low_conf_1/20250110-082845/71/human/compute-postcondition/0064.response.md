`count_north` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is a positive integer at least 3, and `result` is a list containing at least one element, now it contains one more element which is `'R'`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but `count_north` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3; `result` is a list containing at least one element, now it contains one more element which is `'R'`; `count_north` is decreased by 1.**
