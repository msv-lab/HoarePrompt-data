The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of instructions, and `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' representing the sequence of instructions.

Based on the output cases:

- Case_1: The function returns 'NO'.
- Case_2: The function returns a string consisting of 'R' or 'H' based on the final character processed in the string 's'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'. It then returns 'NO' in some cases and a string consisting of 'R' or 'H' based on the final character processed in the string `s`.
