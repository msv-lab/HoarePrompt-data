The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The initial state tells us that `s` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is 'S'. Since `s` is incremented by 1, the new value of `s` will be 3 if `i` was 'S' (making `s` 2 initially) or 1 if `i` was not 'S' (making `s` 0 initially). 

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is either 1 or 0, `s` is 3 if the character `i` is 'S' and 1 if the character `i` is not 'S', `w` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is 'W', `e` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is not 'W', `nn` is the final count of 'N' in `l` after processing, `ss` is the final count of 'S' in `l` after processing, `ww` is the final count of 'W' in `l` after processing, `ee` is the final count of 'E' in `l` after processing, and `i` is the next character in the string `l`.**
