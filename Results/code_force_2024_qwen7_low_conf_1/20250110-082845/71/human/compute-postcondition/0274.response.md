`hh[1]` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `hh[1]`, we will denote it as `hh[1]` before the increment. After the increment, `hh[1]` will be `hh[1] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`hh[1]` is `hh[1] + 1`, `hh` is the same list as before but with `hh[1]` incremented by 1**
