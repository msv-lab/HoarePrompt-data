Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`. If `i` is 'E':
- `r` is determined as follows: if `ee` was originally 0 or an odd number and became even, then `r` is 1, otherwise `r` is 0.
- `h` is determined similarly: if `ee` was originally 0 or an odd number and became even, then `h` is 0, otherwise `h` is 1.
- `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]` if `rr[2]` is 0, `[0, 0, 0, 0]` if `rr[2]` is not 0 and `hh[2]` is False, and `[0, 0, 1, 0]` if `rr[2]` is not 0 and `hh[2]` is True.
- `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` if `rr[2]` is 0, `[0, h_value - 1, hh[2] - 1, hh[3]]` if `rr[2]` is not 0 and `hh[2]` is True, and `[0, 0, 0, 1]` if `rr[2]` is not 0 and `hh[2]` is False.
- `pp` is `['R']` if `ee` was originally 0 or an odd number and became even, `['H']` if `hh[2]` is True, and remains `['H']` otherwise.

Otherwise (if `i` is not 'E'):
- `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0,
- `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`,
- `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`,
- If `nn` is non-zero, `r` is either 0 or 1, `h` is either 0 or 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` with `(hh[0])` being False, and `pp` is either an empty list or a list containing 'R' or 'H'.
- If `nn` is 0, `r` is at least 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[1, 0, 0, 0]` with `(hh[0])` being True, and `pp` is `['H']`.
- If `i` is 'S', then `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 1, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` with `(hh[0])` being False, and `pp` is `['R']`.
- Otherwise, `r` is 0, `h` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 1, 0, 0]` with `(hh[0])` being False, and `pp` is `['H']***.
