The code `rr[1] += 1` increments the value at index 1 of the list `rr` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `rr[1]`, let's denote it as an initial value `x`. Therefore, `rr[1]` will be `x + 1`.

Output State: **`rr` is a list with `rr[1]` equal to `rr[1]` + 1, i.e., `rr[1]` is now `x + 1`, where `x` is the initial value of `rr[1]`.**
