Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `s` is a string, `result` is either ['R'] or ['H'], depending on whether `s[i]` is 'N' or not. If `s[i]` is 'N', then `count_north` is decreased by 1; if `s[i]` is not 'N', then `count_south` is decreased by 1. `i` is increased by 1, and `count_east` is one less than its initial value if `s[i-1] == 'E'`, otherwise `count_west` is decreased by 1.***
