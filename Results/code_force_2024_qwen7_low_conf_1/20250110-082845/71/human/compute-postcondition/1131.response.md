The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Given the initial state, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`. However, since the exact value of `i` is not specified and does not affect the direct operation of appending `'H'` to `pp`, we only know that `pp` now contains the character `'H'`.

The output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list containing `'H'`, `r` is 2, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh` is undefined and its first element is decreased by 1.**
