Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `s` is a string, `result` is either `['R', 'R']`, `['H', 'R']`, `['H']`, or `['H', 'H']`, depending on the initial value of `result` and the character `s[i]`. After executing the if statement, `i` is increased by 1, `count_north` is decreased by 1 if `s[i]` is 'N', `count_south` is decreased by 1 regardless of `s[i]`, `count_east` is one less than its initial value, `count_west` is decreased by 1 if `s[i-1] == 'W'`, otherwise `count_west` is further decreased by 1. If `s[i] == 'E'`, `result` is now `['R']` if it was `['H']` or remains `['R']` if it was already `['R']`, or `result` is `['R', 'H']` or `['H']`. If `s[i] == 'W'`, the same conditions apply but `count_west` is further decreased by 1 instead.***
