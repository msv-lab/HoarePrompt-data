`h` is incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', and `hh[3]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[3]` is decreased by 1**
