The code snippet `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify what `pp` is, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'`, `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

Other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 'N', `r` is incremented by 1, `nn` is true and odd, `pp` is ['R']**
