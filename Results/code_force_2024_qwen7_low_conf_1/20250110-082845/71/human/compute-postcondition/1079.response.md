The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. The value of `pp` changes, while the other variables (`t`, `i`, `r`, and `h`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 2; `i` is the next character in `l`; `pp` is a list containing ['H']; `r` is incremented by 1; `h` is incremented by 1**
