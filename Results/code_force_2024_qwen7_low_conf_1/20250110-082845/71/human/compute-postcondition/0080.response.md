The code snippet appends the string `'H'` to the list `result`. Given the initial state, `result` is either `['R']` or `['H']`, depending on whether `s[i]` is 'N' or not. Since the code simply appends `'H'` to `result`, regardless of its initial value, it will now be `['H']` if it was initially `['R']`, or `['H', 'H']` if it was initially `['H']`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `s` is a string, `result` is `['H']` or `['H', 'H']`, depending on its initial value, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, `count_north` is decreased by 1 if `s[i]` is 'N', `count_south` is decreased by 1 if `s[i]` is not 'N', `count_east` is one less than its initial value if `s[i-1] == 'E'`, otherwise `count_west` is decreased by 1.**
