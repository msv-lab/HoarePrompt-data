`count_west` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count_west` was based on the character at index `i + 1` in the string `s`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n`; `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1; `count_north`, `count_south`, and `count_east` are unchanged; `count_west` is the original value of `count_west` plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n`; `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1; `count_north` is unchanged; `count_south` is unchanged; `count_east` is unchanged; `count_west` is the original value of `count_west` plus 1.**
