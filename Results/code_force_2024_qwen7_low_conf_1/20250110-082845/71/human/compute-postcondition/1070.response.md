`h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` was not specified, but it could be either `0` or `1` based on the given conditions (it may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'). However, since `i` is the next character in `l` and no specific value for `i` is given, we consider the general case where `h` could have been 0 or 1 before this line of code. After executing `h += 1`, `h` will now be 1 if it was initially 0, and 2 if it was initially 1. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, `r`, and `hh`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is either 1 or 2, `hh` is [0, 0, 1]**
