Postcondition: ***`hh` and `rr` are lists. If `hh[3]` is truthy, then `hh[3]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H']. Otherwise, if `r < h`, the value at index 2 of `rr` is increased by 2, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains the elements ['R']. Otherwise, the value at index 2 of `hh` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the elements ['H'].***
