The code `rr[1] -= 1` decrements the value at index 1 of the list `rr` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `rr[1]`, let's denote the initial value of `rr[1]` as `v`. After executing the code, the value of `rr[1]` will be `v - 1`.

Output State: **`rr[1]` is `v - 1`, where `v` is the initial value of `rr[1]`**
