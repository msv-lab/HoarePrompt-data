`ss` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `ss` is not given, so we cannot determine its new value specifically. However, we know that `ss` was initially some value from which 1 has been subtracted. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is either `['R']` or `['H']` depending on the condition, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', otherwise `h` is 3; `ss` is decreased by 1.**
