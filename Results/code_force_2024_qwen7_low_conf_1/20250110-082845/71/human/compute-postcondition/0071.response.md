`result.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `result`. Since `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, this information remains unchanged. The output state is: `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3; `result` is a list containing the element 'H'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3; `result` is a list containing the element 'H'**
