`count_south` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The counts `count_north`, `count_east`, and `count_west` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `count_south` is incremented by 1.**
