`h` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `h` was 1, so the new value of `h` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string, `i` is not equal to 'E', the current value of `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is False, `hh[0]` is 2, and the condition r >= h is true.

Output State: **`i` is a string, `i` is not equal to 'E', the current value of `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is False, `hh[0]` is 2, and the condition r >= h is true**
