Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, and based on the character at index `i + 1`, `count_south` is incremented by 1 if the character is 'S'. If the character is 'E', `count_east` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_west` is incremented by 1.***
