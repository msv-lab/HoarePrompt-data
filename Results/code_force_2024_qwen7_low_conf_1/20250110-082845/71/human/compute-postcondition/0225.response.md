`h` is incremented by 1, and the value of `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. Since the initial state only specifies the change in `hh[2]` but does not give the initial value of `h`, we can only state the changes made to the variables. The output state is: `h` is increased by 1; `hh[2]` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`h` is increased by 1; `hh[2]` is decreased by 1**
