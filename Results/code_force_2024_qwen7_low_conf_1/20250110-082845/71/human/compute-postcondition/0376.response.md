Postcondition: ***`i` is either 'E', 'N', or 'S'. If `i` is 'E':
- `ee` is a boolean where `ee = ee - 1` if it was `True`, `rr[2]` and `hh[2]` are checked and modified accordingly, or `rr[3]` and `r` are updated along with possible changes to `hh` and `pp`.
- `h`, `pp`, `r`, `rr`, and `hh` are updated based on the value of `ee` and the conditions specified.
If `i` is 'N':
- `nn` is an integer where if it is odd, `nn` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to 'R'. Otherwise, `r` and `h` are increased by 1, and `pp` is set to either 'R' or 'H'. `rr[1]`, `hh[1]`, and `hh[0]` are updated according to their initial values.
If `i` is 'S':
- `ss` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `pp` is either `['R']` or `[ 'R' ]`, `hh` is a list of at least two elements, and `h` is an integer. Depending on the initial value of `ss` and the comparison between `r` and `h`, `r`, `pp`, `hh[0]`, and `hh[1]` are updated accordingly.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block based on the value of `i` and the subsequent updates to the variables `ee`, `h`, `pp`, `r`, `rr`, and `hh`.
