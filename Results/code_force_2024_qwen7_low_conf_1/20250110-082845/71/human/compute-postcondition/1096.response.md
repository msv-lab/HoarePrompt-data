Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. Depending on the value of `rr[2]`, `pp` is either adjusted based on `i` plus the string `'R'` or set to `['H']`. Additionally, `hh[2]` is one less than its original value, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1 if `i` is not 'W'.***
