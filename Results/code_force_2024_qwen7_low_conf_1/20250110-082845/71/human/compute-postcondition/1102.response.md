Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is either a list containing elements adjusted based on the value of `i` (plus the string `'H'` if applicable) or `['R']` if `nn % 2 == 1`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', otherwise it may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'.***
