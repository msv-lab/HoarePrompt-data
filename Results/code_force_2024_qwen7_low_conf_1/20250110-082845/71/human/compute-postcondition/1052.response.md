Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`. If `i` equals 'W', then `pp` is a list containing either 'R' or 'H' based on specific conditions, `r` is 1 if `ww` was even or `ww` was 0, and `r` is increased by 1 under certain conditions. Otherwise, `pp` is a list containing either 'R' or 'H' based on specific conditions, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` may be increased by 1 depending on the conditions.***
