Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`. If `rr[0]` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing the string `'H'` unless `r < h`, in which case `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing `'R'`, or `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is incremented by 1 with `pp` being `['H']`.***
