Postcondition: **`nn`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, `hh` are as follows:
- If `nn % 2 == 1`, then `nn` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains 'R'.
- If `nn % 2 != 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains either 'R' or 'H'.
- `rr[1]` is either `v - 1` or `val - 1`.
- If `rr[1]` is `v - 1`, then `r` is increased by 1.
- If `hh[1]` is `val - 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `rr[0]` is `some_value + 1`.
- Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `hh[0]` is `initial_value + 1`.
- `pp` is updated accordingly to contain either 'R' or 'H'.**
