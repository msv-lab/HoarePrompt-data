Postcondition: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `r` is incremented by 1. If `hh[0]` is True, then `pp` is a list containing `'H'`, `r` is 2, and `h` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, and `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. If `r` is less than `h`, then `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i` plus `'H'`, and both `h` and `hh[1]` are incremented by 1.**
