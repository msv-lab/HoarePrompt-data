`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined, it is assumed to be a list. The value of `i` does not directly affect the content of the list, but it is mentioned that `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, which implies that `i` could have influenced `pp` before this line of code. However, since no specific operation on `i` is shown, the only change is the appending of `'R'` to `pp`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2; `i` is the next character in `l`; `pp` is a list containing the elements it had before plus `'R'`; `r` is the original value of `r` plus 1; `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'; `rr[0]` is increased by 1.
