`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The initial state shows that `pp` was adjusted based on the value of `i`, but since the exact value of `pp` is not given, we can only say that `'R'` is appended to `pp`.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list containing the value adjusted based on `i` and additionally `'R'`, `r` is `i + 1`, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[3]` is incremented by 1**
