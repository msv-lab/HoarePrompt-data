The code `count_north += 1` increments the value of `count_north` by 1. Given the initial state where `count_north` is 0, after executing this line of code, `count_north` will be 1. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` is 1, `count_south` is 0, `count_east` is 0, `count_west` is 0, the current character being processed is 'N'**
