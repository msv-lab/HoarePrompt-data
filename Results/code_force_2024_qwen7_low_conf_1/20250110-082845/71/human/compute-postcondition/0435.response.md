The code `pp = []` creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `pp`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is a string, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the last character in the string `l`, `r` is 0, `h` is 0, `rr` is a list of four zeros, `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is an empty list**.
