Postcondition: ***`ss`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, `hh`, `total`, `num`, and `x` are as follows:
- If `i` equals 'S' and `ss` was initially odd, then `r` is increased by 1, `h` remains the same, and `pp` is set to `['H']`; if `ss` was initially even, then `r` remains the same, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
- If `i` equals 'S' and `rr[0]` is `v - 1`, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, and `x` is 0, then `total` remains positive, `num` remains negative, `x` remains 0, `r` is 1, `pp` contains `'R'`, and `rr[0]` remains `v - 1`.
- If `i` equals 'S' and `hh[0]` is true, then `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is set to `['H']`, and the rest of the elements in `hh` remain unchanged.
- If `i` equals 'S' and `hh[0]` is false, then either `rr[1]` is set to `v + 1`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']` if `r < h`; or `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains `['H']` if `r >= h`.***

This postcondition covers all the possible scenarios within the if part of the if-else statement, ensuring that the overall state of the program variables is accurately described after the execution of the if statement.
