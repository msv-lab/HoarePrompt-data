The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in the given function signature. However, based on the constraints and the nature of the problem, it seems the function should handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a string `s`. The function needs to process these inputs according to certain rules but the exact processing logic is not provided.

Given the output cases are not directly related to the function signature, we can infer that the function might internally parse the input data (test cases) and process each one individually.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'. The function returns different outputs based on the processing of these test cases.**
