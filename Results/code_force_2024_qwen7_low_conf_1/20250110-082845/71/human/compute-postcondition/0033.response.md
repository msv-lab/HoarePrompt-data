Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is incremented by 1. Depending on the character at index `i + 1`, either `count_north` is incremented by 1 if the character is 'N', `count_south` is incremented by 1 if the character is 'S', `count_east` is incremented by 1 if the character is 'E', or `count_west` is incremented by 1 if the character is not 'N', 'S', or 'E'.***
