The code `rr[3] -= 1` decrements the value at index 3 of the list `rr` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `rr`. We can represent the initial state as `rr` is a list where the fourth element (index 3) can be any integer value.

After executing the code, the value at index 3 of `rr` will be decremented by 1. 

Output State: **`rr` is a list where the fourth element (index 3) is decreased by 1.**
