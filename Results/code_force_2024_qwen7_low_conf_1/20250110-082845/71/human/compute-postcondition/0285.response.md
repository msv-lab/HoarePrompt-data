Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - We need to consider the conditions based on the value of `i`.
   - The values of `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` are given, but we need to know their exact values from the previous iteration to determine the next state.

2. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the list `l`.
   - We need to adjust the states based on the current value of `i`.

3. **Conditions Based on `i`:**
   - If `i == 'W'`:
     - If `ww` is true:
       - Increment `r` and `h`.
       - Update `pp` based on whether `ww` was even or odd.
       - If `r < h`, increment `rr[2]` and add 'R' to `pp`; otherwise, increment `hh[2]`.
     - If `ww` is false:
       - Increment `r` and `h`.
       - Increment `rr[3]` and `hh[3]`.
       - Update `pp` based on whether `ww` was even or odd.
   - If `i == 'E'`:
     - Increment `r` and `h` under specific conditions involving `ee`, `rr[2]`, and the comparison between `r` and `h`.
     - Update `pp` accordingly.
     - Increment `rr[3]` and `hh[3]`.
   - If `i != 'W'` and `i != 'E'`:
     - Increment `h`.
     - Increment `hh[3]`.
     - Do not change `r` and `pp`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since we don't have the exact values of `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` from the previous iteration, let's assume we need to consider the general case where `i` could be any character in `l`.

5. **General Case:**
   - For the next iteration, if `i` is not `'W'` or `'E'`, `h` will be incremented, and `hh[3]` will be incremented.
   - If `i` is `'W'` and `ww` is true, `r` and `h` will be incremented, and depending on the condition, either `rr[2]` or `hh[2]` will be incremented, and `pp` will be updated.
   - If `i` is `'W'` and `ww` is false, similar actions will occur but with different conditions.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- If `i` is not `'W'` or `'E'`, `h` will be incremented, and `hh[3]` will be incremented.
- If `i` is `'W'` and `ww` is true, `r` and `h` will be incremented, and depending on the condition, either `rr[2]` or `hh[2]` will be incremented, and `pp` will be updated.
- If `i` is `'W'` and `ww` is false, similar actions will occur but with different conditions.

Since we need to provide a specific state, we'll assume the general case where `i` is not `'W'` or `'E'`.

**Final State:**
State: **`ww` remains the same, `ee` remains the same, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` may or may not be updated, `rr[3]` remains the same, `hh[3]` is incremented by 1**.

This is the most general state that can be derived without knowing the exact values of `ww` and `ee` from the previous iteration.
