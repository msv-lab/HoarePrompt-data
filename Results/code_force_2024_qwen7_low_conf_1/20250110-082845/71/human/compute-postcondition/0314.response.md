The code `rr[2] -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value at index 2 of the list `rr`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `rr`, let's denote the initial value at `rr[2]` as `v`.

The operation `rr[2] -= 1` is equivalent to `rr[2] = rr[2] - 1`. So, the value at index 2 of the list `rr` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`rr[2]` is `v - 1`, `rr` is a list where the value at index 2 is reduced by 1**
