`h` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `h` is `hh[1] + 1`. Since `hh[1]` was originally `True`, which is equivalent to `1`, the new value of `h` becomes `2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is a string and equal to 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E', `rr[0]` is False, `hh[0]` is False, `hh[1]` is True, `h` is 2**
