`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. This operation changes the list `pp` by adding one more element to it. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `r` is `r + 1`, `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is a list containing the elements from the original `pp` plus the string `'R'`, `rr[2]` is decreased by 1, `hh` may change in terms of its values.**
