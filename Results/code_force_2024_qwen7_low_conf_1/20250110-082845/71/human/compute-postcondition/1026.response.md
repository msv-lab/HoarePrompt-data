Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`. If `nn` was 0, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is `['R']` if `rr[1]` is true, otherwise `pp` is `['H']` if `hh[1]` is true, otherwise `pp` is a list containing one element `'R'` if `r < h`, otherwise `pp` is a list containing one element `'H'`. If `nn` was 1, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is `['R']` if `nn` was 1 before decrementing, otherwise `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is `['H']`.***
