`n` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `2 + 1 = 3`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is 3, `s` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is 'S', `w` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is 'W', `e` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is not 'W', `nn` is the final count of 'N' in `l` after processing, `ss` is the final count of 'S' in `l` after processing, `ww` is the final count of 'W' in `l` after processing, `ee` is the final count of 'E' in `l` after processing, and `i` is the next character in the string `l`.**
