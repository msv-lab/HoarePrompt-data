`h` is incremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was previously to `initial_value + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh[0]` is `initial_value + 1`, and `h` is `initial_value + 2`.

Output State: **`hh[0]` is `initial_value + 1`, and `h` is `initial_value + 2`**
