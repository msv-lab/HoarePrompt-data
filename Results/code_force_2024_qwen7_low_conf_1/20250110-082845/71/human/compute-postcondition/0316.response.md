`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `rr[2]` is `v - 1`, and `r` is increased by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `rr[2]` is `v - 1`, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the value `'R'`.

Output State: **`rr[2]` is `v - 1`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains the value `'R'`**
