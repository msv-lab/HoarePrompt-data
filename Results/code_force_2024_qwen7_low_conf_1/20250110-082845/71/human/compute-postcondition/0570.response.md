Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the last character in the string `l` and `i` is 'S', `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is `['R']`, and the last character in the string `l` is 'S', but `ss` is not true. If `rr[0]` is True, then `r` is 1, `h` remains 0, `rr` remains `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` remains a list of four zeros, `pp` remains `['R']`. Otherwise, `r` is 0 or 1 depending on whether it is less than `h`, `h` is 0 or 1, `rr` is a list [0, 1, 0, 0] if `r` is 1, otherwise it is a list of four zeros, `hh` is [0, 1, 0, 0] if `r` is 0, otherwise it is a list of four zeros, `pp` is a list containing ['R'] if `r` is 1, otherwise it is `['H']`, and the last character in the string `l` is 'S', but `ss` is not true, and `hh[0]` is either -1 or false.***
