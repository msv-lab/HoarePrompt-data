Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`. If `ss % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is appended with `'R'`, and `h` and `pp` may change in terms of their contents; otherwise, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is appended with `'H'`, and `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values.***
