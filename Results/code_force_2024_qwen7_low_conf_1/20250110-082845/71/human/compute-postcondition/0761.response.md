Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`. If `i == 'W'` and `ww` is true (`nn + ss - 2`), `r` is increased by 1 if `ww % 2 == 1` before the decrement, and `pp` contains `'R'` if `ww % 2 == 1` before the decrement. If `rr[3]` is true, `r` is `t - 1`, `pp` contains `'R'`, `rr[3]` is decreased by 1, and `hh` may change. If `hh[3]` is true, `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is the original list with `'H'` appended, `hh` is the same list but with the value at index 3 decreased by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `r < h`, `r` is increased by 1, `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is a list containing elements from the initial state plus `'H'`, `hh` has its third element incremented by 1, and `rr` and `hh` may change; `h` is increased by 1. If `ww` is false, `pp` is now a list containing one more element `H`, and `h` is incremented by 1 if `ww % 2 != 1` before the decrement. If `i == 'E'`, `r` and `h` may change, `pp` may include additional elements, and `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values. If `i == 'N'`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains at least one element `'R'`, and `h` may change. If `(nn - 1) % 2 == 1`, `r` is further incremented by 1 and `pp` contains at least one element `'R'`. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains at least one element `'H'`. Depending on the value of `rr[0]` and `hh[0]`, `r`, `h`, and `pp` may change, and `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values.**
