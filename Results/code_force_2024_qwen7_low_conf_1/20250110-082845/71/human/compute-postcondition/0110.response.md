The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since the initial state says that the current value of `r` is less than `h`, and `r` is incremented by 1, the new value of `r` is now 1 more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'E', `rr[2]` is False, `rr[3]` is the original value of `rr[3]` + 1, `hh[2]` is False, `r` is the original value of `r` + 1**
