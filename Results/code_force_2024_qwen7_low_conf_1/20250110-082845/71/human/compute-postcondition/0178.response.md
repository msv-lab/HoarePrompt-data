The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was initially less than `h`, and no specific value for `h` is given, we know `r` is now one more than its original value but still less than `h`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string and equals 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E', `rr[0]` is False, `rr[1]` is 1, `hh[0]` is False, `r` is equal to its original value plus 1 and is still less than `h`.**
