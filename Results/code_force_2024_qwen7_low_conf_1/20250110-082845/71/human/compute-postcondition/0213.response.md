Postcondition: ***`rr[3]` and `hh[3]` are integers, `r` and `h` are integers, and `pp` is a list. If `rr[3]` is true, then `rr[3]` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` is updated to contain `'R'` appended to its previous contents, and the rest of the elements in `rr` and `hh` remain unchanged. If `rr[3]` is false, then `hh[3]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is updated to contain `'H'`, and if `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is incremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains at least one additional element `'R'`. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains as `['H']`.***
