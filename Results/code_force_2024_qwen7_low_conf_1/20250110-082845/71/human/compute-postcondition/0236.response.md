Postcondition: ***`ee`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` are as follows:
- If `ee` is `ee-1` and `ee-1` is odd, then `r` is increased by 1, `h` is the original value of `h` plus 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.
- If `rr[2]` is `True`, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` includes 'R', and `rr[3]` is incremented by 1.
- If `hh[2]` is `True`, then `h` is increased by 1 and `hh[2]` is decremented by 1.
- If `r` is less than `h`, then both `r` and `h` are increased by 1, `rr[3]` is incremented by 1, and `hh[2]` remains unchanged.
- If `r` is not less than `h`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `hh[3]` is incremented by 1.
- In all cases, `pp` is a list containing either 'R' or ['H'].***
