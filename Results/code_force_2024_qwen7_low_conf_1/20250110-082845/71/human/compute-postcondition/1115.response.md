The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was previously adjusted based on the value of `i`, this operation changes its contents. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `r`, `h`, `hh`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list containing the elements from its previous state plus `'H'`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh`'s first element is incremented by 1.**
