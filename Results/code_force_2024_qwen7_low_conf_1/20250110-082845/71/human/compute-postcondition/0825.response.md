`pp` is a list that gets an element appended to it. The element appended is `'R'`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`, `ww` is a positive integer with an odd remainder when divided by 2, `ee` is 0, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is a list containing one element `'R'`.
