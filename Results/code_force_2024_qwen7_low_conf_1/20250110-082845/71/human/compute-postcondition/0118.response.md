Postcondition: ***`i` is 'E', `r` and `h` remain unchanged, and the state of `rr[2]` and `rr[3]` depends on the condition `rr[2]`. If `rr[2]` is True, `i` is 'E', `r` is `r + 1`, and `rr[3]` is the original value of `rr[3]` + 1. Otherwise, `rr[2]` is False, `rr[3]` remains unchanged, and `hh[3]` is `hh[3] + 1`. Also, if `r < h`, then `r` is the original value of `r` + 1 and `h` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged and `h` is `h + 1`. The list `pp` becomes `['R']` if `r < h` and `['H']` otherwise.***
