`pp` is a list to which the string 'H' is appended. The values of `hh[3]` and `h` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only changes are that 'H' is added to the list `pp`. The output state remains the same for `hh[3]` and `h`, but now `pp` contains the element 'H'.

Output State: **`hh[3]` is decreased by 1; `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is ['H']**
