Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`) or 0, `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is 0, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is an empty list, and the current value of `rr[2]` is true**
