Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` equals `count_south` and is an integer, `count_east` is `count_west - 1`, `count_west` is an integer, `result` is a list containing ['R'] or ['H'], `i` is 1 or 0, the character at index `i` in `s` is 'E', 'W', 'S', or 'N'***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block, considering both branches of the condition and their respective effects on the program variables.
