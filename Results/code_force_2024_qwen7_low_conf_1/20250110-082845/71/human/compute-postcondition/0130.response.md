`nn` is decremented by 1, which means `nn` will now be one less than its previous value. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'N', `r` is incremented by 1 if `nn` is true and odd, and `h` is increased by 1 if `nn` is true and even, `nn` is `nn` - 1, and `pp` is either ['R'] or ['H']**
