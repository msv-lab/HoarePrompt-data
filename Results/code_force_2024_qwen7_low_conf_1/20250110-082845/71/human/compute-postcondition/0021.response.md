The code increments the value of `count_east` by 1. The initial state of `count_east` is not specified, but it is an integer. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `count_north`, `count_south`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` and `count_south` are updated based on the current character, `count_east` is incremented by 1.**
