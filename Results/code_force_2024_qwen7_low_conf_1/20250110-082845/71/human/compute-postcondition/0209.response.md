`h` is incremented by 1, but since `hh[2]` was previously increased by 1, we only know that `h` was part of `hh` and its value has been incremented. The specific value of `hh[2]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `hh[2]`. However, we can state that `h` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`hh[2]` is increased by 1; `h` is increased by 1**
