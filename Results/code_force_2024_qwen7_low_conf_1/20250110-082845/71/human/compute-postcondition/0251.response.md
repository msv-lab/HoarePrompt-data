`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `rr[0]` is increased by 1 and the value of `r` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `rr[0]` is increased by 1; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` contains the value `['R']`.

Output State: **`rr[0]` is increased by 1; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is ['R']**
