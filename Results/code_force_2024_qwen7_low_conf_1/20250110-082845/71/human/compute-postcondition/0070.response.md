`count_east` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `count_east` is not specified, but since `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, and there is no other information about `count_east`, we can only say that `count_east` was a positive integer and is now one less than its initial value. The state of `n` and `result` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3; `result` is ['R']; `count_east` is one less than its initial value**
