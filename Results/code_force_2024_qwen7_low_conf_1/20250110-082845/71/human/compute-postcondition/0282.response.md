Postcondition: **`nn`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` are as follows:**

- If `i` is 'N' and `nn` is initially odd, then `r` is `r + 1`, `h` is 2, and `pp` is `[ 'H' ]`. If `nn` is initially even, then:
  - If `rr[1]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains 'R', and `rr[1]` is decremented by 1.
  - If `hh[1]` is true, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is set to `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is decremented by 1.
  - If `r < h` and `hh[1]` is false, `rr[0]` is incremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
  - If neither `rr[1]` nor `hh[1]` is true and `r >= h`, `hh[0]` is set to `initial_value + 1`, `h` is set to `initial_value + 2`, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.
- `nn` is updated to `nn - 1`.

- If `i` is 'S' and `ss` was initially odd, then `r` is increased by 1, `h` remains the same, and `pp` is set to `['H']`; if `ss` was initially even, then `r` remains the same, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
- If `i` is 'S' and `rr[0]` is `v - 1`, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, and `x` is 0, then `total` remains positive, `num` remains negative, `x` remains 0, `r` is 1, `pp` contains `'R'`, and `rr[0]` remains `v - 1`.
- If `i` is 'S' and `hh[0]` is true, then `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is set to `['H']`, and the rest of the elements in `hh` remain unchanged.
- If `i` is 'S' and `hh[0]` is false, then either `rr[1]` is set to `v + 1`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']` if `r < h`; or `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains `['H']` if `r >= h`.**
