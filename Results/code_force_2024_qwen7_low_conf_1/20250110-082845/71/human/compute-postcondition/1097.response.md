Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `r` is incremented by 1. Depending on the value of `ee`, `pp` is either ['H'] or adjusted based on `i` plus the string `'R'`. If `i` is not 'W', `h` is incremented by 1, and if `i` equals 'W', `h` is the initial value of `h` + 1. Additionally, `hh[2]` is one less than its original value, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1 if `i` is not 'W'.***
