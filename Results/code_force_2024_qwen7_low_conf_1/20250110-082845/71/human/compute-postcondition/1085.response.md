`hh[2]` is decremented by 1. The value of `hh[2]` was not specified in the initial state, so we only know that it is now one less than its original value. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, `r`, and `h`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `hh[2]` is one less than its original value.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `hh[2]` is one less than its original value**
