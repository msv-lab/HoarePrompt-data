Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, the current value of `i` is 'E', `r` and `h` are either 0 or as specified, `rr` and `hh` are lists of specific values, `pp` is either an empty list, contains ['R'], or contains ['H'], and the last character in the string `l` is not 'W'. If `ee` is true, `ee` is decremented by 1, `r` is either 1 or 0, and `h` is either 1 or 0. Otherwise, `ee` remains unchanged, and `r` and `h` are determined based on the values of `rr[2]` and `hh[2]` as described above.***
