`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `h` was not specified in the initial state, so we only know that it has been incremented. The values of the other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `hh[2]` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1.**
