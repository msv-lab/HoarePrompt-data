`pp` is a list that gets an element appended to it. The value of `i` is the new last character in the string `l`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 2; `m` is the integer input by the user; `l` must have at least one character (now shorter by one); `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`; `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`; `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`; `ee` is `e - w`; `i` is the new last character in the string `l`; `r` is incremented by 1; `h` is either 0 or 1; `rr` is a list of four integers; `hh` is a list of four integers; `pp` is a list with an additional element `'R'`.
