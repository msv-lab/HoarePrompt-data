Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`. If `r < h`, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` has an additional element `'R'` appended to it, `rr` is a list with the second element incremented by 1, and `hh` may change in terms of its values. Otherwise, `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is `h_{prev} + 1`.**
