Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`. If `i == 'E'`, then depending on the value of `ee` and other conditions, `r` and `h` may change, `pp` may include additional elements, and `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values. If `i == 'N'`, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains at least one element `'R'`, and `h` may change. If `(nn - 1) % 2 == 1`, `r` is further incremented by 1 and `pp` contains at least one element `'R'`. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains at least one element `'H'`. Depending on the value of `rr[0]` and `hh[0]`, `r`, `h`, and `pp` may change, and `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes of the if-else block, covering all the specified conditions and their effects on the variables.
