Postcondition: ***`ee`, `h`, `pp`, `rr[2]`, `hh[2]`, `r`, and `h` are as follows:
- If `ee` is `True`, then `ee` becomes `ee - 1`, `h` is set to 2, and `pp` is `['H']`.
- If `ee` is `False`:
  - If `rr[2]` is `v - 1`, then `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the value `'R'`.
  - If `hh[2]` is `True`, then `hh[2]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.
  - Otherwise, `rr[3]` is increased by 2, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R' if `r < h`. Otherwise, `hh` remains unchanged except for the value at index 3 being incremented by 2, and `pp` contains 'H'.***
