`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `hh[0]` is updated to `hh[0] - 1` from the initial state, and the rest of the elements in `hh` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh[0]` is `hh[0] - 1`; `h` is increased by 1; the rest of the elements in `hh` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hh[0]` is `hh[0] - 1`; `h` is increased by 1; the rest of the elements in `hh` remain unchanged.**
