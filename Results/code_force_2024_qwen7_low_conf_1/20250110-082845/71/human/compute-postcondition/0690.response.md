Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`.

- If `rr[3]` is true, then `r` is `t - 1`, `pp` contains the element `'R'`, `rr[3]` is decreased by 1, and `hh` may change in terms of its values.
- If `hh[3]` is true, then `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is the original list with `'H'` appended, `hh` is the same list but with the value at index 3 decreased by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `r` is increased by 1, `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is a list containing elements from the initial state plus `'H'`, `hh` has its third element incremented by 1, and `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values; `h` is increased by 1.**
