`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. This changes the value of `pp` from whatever it was previously to a list containing the original elements plus `'H'`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is a list including the original elements plus `'H'`, `hh` and `rr` may change in terms of their values; `h` is increased by 1.**
