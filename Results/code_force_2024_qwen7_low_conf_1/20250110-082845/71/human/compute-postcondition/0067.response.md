Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3. If `s[i]` is 'N', then `result` will contain at least one element, now it contains one more element which is `'R'`, and `count_north` is decreased by 1. If `s[i]` is not 'N', then `result` is ['H'] and `count_south` is decreased by 1.***
