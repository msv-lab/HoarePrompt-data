`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The value of `t`, `m`, `l`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `i`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character (now shorter by one), `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the new last character in the string `l`, `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1, `rr` is a list of four integers, `hh` is a list of four integers, and `pp` has been appended with `'H'`.
