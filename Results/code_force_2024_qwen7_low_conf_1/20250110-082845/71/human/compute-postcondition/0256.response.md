Postcondition: **`r`, `h` are integers, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are lists. If `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is set to `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is set to `hh[1] - 1`. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `rr[0]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']`. If neither condition is met, then `hh[0]` is set to `initial_value + 1`, `h` is set to `initial_value + 2`, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.**
