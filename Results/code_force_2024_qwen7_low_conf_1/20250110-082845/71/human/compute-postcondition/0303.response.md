`pp` is appended with the string 'H'. The value of `hh[2]` is increased by 1, but the initial value of `hh[2]` is not specified. The other elements of the list `hh` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh` is a list where the third element is `hh[2] + 1`; `pp` is a list containing the element 'H'.

Output State: **`hh` is a list where the third element is `hh[2] + 1`; `pp` is a list containing the element 'H'.**
