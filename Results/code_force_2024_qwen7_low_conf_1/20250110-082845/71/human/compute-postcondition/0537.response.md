Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l` (either minus 1 or as originally), `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is 'N', `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1 depending on whether `nn` is odd or even (or are integers if `else` is executed), `rr` is a list of four integers, and `hh` is a list of four integers. If `else` is executed, `r` and `h` are updated based on the conditions specified in the else part, and `pp` is a list containing either 'R' or 'H' or is an empty list with the additional element 'H'. The last character in the string `l` is not 'E'.***
