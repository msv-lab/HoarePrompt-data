Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`. If `i == 'N'`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list containing at least one element `'R'`. If `(nn - 1) % 2 == 1`, `r` is further incremented by 1 and `pp` contains at least one element `'R'`. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains at least one element `'H'`. If `rr[1]` is true, `rr[1]` is reduced by 1 and `r` is increased by 1. If `i != 'N'`, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is appended with `'R'`. Depending on `rr[0]`:
- If `rr[0]` is true, then `rr[0]` is decreased by 1.
- If `hh[0]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1, `hh[0]` is decreased by 1, and if `r < h`, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` has an additional element `'R'` appended to it, `rr` is a list with the second element incremented by 1, and `hh` may change. If `r >= h`, then `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is `h_{prev} + 1`.
Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is appended with `'H'`. Depending on `rr[0]`:
- If `rr[0]` is true, then `r` is increased by 1, `h` may change, `pp` includes an additional element `'R'`, `rr[0]` is decreased by 1, and `hh` may change.
- If `hh[0]` is true, then `hh[0]` is decreased by 1, `h` is increased by 1. If `r < h`, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` has an additional element `'R'` appended to it, `rr` is a list with the second element incremented by 1, and `hh` may change. If `r >= h`, then `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is `h_{prev} + 1`.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes based on the value of `i` in the if-else block.
