The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was previously 0, it will now be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l` and the current value of `ss` is odd, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the last character in the string `l` and `i` is 'S', `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is a list of four zeros, `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is an empty list, and the last character in the string `l` is 'S'.
