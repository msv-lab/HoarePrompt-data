`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. The value of `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` is 3. After appending `'H'` to `pp`, the value of `pp` changes.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is equal to `['H']` (assuming `pp` was initially empty), `r` is 1 more than its original value, `h` is 3**
