Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` equals `count_south` and is an integer, `count_east` is `count_west - 1`, `count_west` is an integer, `result` is a list containing either ['R'] or ['H'], `i` is 2 or 1, and the character at index `i` in `s` is 'E' or 'W'. If `s[i]` is 'E', then `count_west` is decremented by 1 and `result` becomes ['R']. If `s[i]` is 'W', then `count_east` is incremented by 1 and `result` becomes ['H'].***
