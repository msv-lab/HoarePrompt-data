Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list that includes at least one element from its initial state plus either `'H'` or `'R'`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', otherwise `h` is either 1 or 2, and `hh[3]` is either decreased by 1 (if the if condition is true) or `hh[2]` is incremented by 1 (if the else condition is true).***
