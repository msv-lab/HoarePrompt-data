The code `rr[1] += 1` increments the value at index 1 of the list `rr` by 1. Since the initial state is that `rr[0]` is False and `rr[1]` is undefined (assuming it's an integer initially set to 0), after the operation, `rr[1]` will be incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is a string and equals 'S'
- `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E'
- `rr[0]` is False
- `hh[0]` is False
- `r` is less than `h`

The output state after executing the code will be:
- `rr[1]` is 1 (since it was initially 0 and incremented by 1)
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string and equals 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E', `rr[0]` is False, `rr[1]` is 1, `hh[0]` is False, `r` is less than `h`**
