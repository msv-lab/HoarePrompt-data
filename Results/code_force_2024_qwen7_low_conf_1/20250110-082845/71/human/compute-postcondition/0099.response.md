`rr[2]` is decremented by 1. Initially, `rr[2]` is `True`, which in Python is equivalent to `1`. So, `rr[2]` becomes `0`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is a string and equal to 'E', `rr[2]` is 0, and the state of other variables remains the same.

Output State: **`i` is a string and equal to 'E', `rr[2]` is 0**
