Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is non-zero, `ss` is 0 because `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is either 0 or 1, `h` is either 0 or 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is either an empty list or a list containing 'R' or 'H'. `i` is equal to 'N'.***

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `nn` is odd, `r` is set to 1 and `h` remains 0, and `pp` is set to ['R']. If `nn` is even, `r` remains 0, `h` is set to 1, and 'H' is appended to `pp`.
