Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is an integer, `ss` is an integer, `ww` is an integer, `ee` is an integer, `i` is the string 'N', `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, `pp` is an empty list; `n` is 0, `s` is 0, `w` is 0, `e` is 0.***

The postcondition retains all the information from the precondition and explicitly states that `i` is the string 'N' as per the if condition.
