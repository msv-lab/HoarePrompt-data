Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` equals `count_south` and `count_north` is a positive integer, `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` is a list containing 'R' or 'H', `i` is 0 or 1. If `s[i]` is 'N', then `count_north` is reduced by 1 and `result` is updated to `['R']`, `i` becomes 1. If `s[i]` is 'S', then `count_south` is reduced by 1 and `result` is updated to `['H']`, `i` remains 0.**
