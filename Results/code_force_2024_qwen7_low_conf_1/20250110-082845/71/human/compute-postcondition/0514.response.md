`nn` is decremented by 1. The initial state tells us that `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`. After decrementing, `nn` will be that difference minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l` minus 1, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is 'N', `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1 depending on whether `nn` is odd or even, `rr` is a list of four zeros, `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is a list containing either 'R' or 'H', and the last character in the string `l` is not 'E'.**
