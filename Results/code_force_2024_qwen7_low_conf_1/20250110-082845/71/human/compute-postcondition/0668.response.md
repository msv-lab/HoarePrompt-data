Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` has at least one character (now shorter by one), `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the new last character in the string `l`, `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1, `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'`, `rr` is a list of four integers, and `hh` is a list of four integers. Depending on the value of `i`, the following changes occur:
- If `i == 'W'` and `(nn - ss - 1) % 2 == 1`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains `'R'`, and if `rr[3]` is true, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'R'`; otherwise, if `hh[3]` is true, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'H'`. If `r < h`, `pp` contains `'R'` and the third element of `rr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pp` contains `'H'` and the third element of `hh` is incremented by 1.
- If `i == 'W'` and the above conditions do not apply, `pp` contains either `'R'` or `'H'`.
- If `i == 'E'`, `r` and `h` may be incremented and `rr[2]`, `rr[3]`, `hh[2]`, and `hh[3]` may be modified according to specific conditions, and `pp` will contain either `'R'` or `'H'`.
- If `i == 'N'` and `nn % 2 == 1`, `pp` will have an additional element `'R'`. If `i == 'N'` and `rr[1]` is true, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'R'`. If `i == 'N'` and `hh[1]` is true, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'H'`. If `i == 'N'` and `r < h`, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'R'`; otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.
- If `i == 'S'` and `(ss - 1) % 2 == 1`, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` has an additional element `'R'`. If `i == 'S'` and `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `rr[0]` is decreased by 1, and `pp` contains `'R'`. If `i == 'S'` and `hh[0]` is true, the second element of `hh` remains unchanged, and `pp` contains `'H'`.
- If `i` is neither 'N' nor 'S', no changes are made to `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, or `hh`.***
