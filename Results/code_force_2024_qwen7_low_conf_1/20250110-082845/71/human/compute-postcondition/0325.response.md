`pp` is a list that gets the element `'H'` appended to it. The value at index 3 of `hh` remains unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh` is a list where the value at index 3 is the original value + 2; all other elements remain unchanged; `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`hh` is a list where the value at index 3 is the original value + 2; all other elements remain unchanged; `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`**
