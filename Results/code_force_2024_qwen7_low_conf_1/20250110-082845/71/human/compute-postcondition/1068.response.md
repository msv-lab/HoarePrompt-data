The code snippet `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. This affects the list `pp` by adding a new element. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `r`, `h`, and `rr`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is ['R'], `r` is incremented by 1 (new value is `r + 1`), `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[2]` is incremented by 1**
