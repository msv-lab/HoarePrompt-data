Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, and `pp` is an empty list. If the condition `nn % 2 == 1 or ss % 2 == 1 or ww % 2 == 1 or (ee % 2 == 1)` is true, 'NO' is printed to the console. Otherwise, `r` and `h` are the sum of all increments, the console outputs `pp` joined as a string, or both are set to 0 and the program prints 'NO'. `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` are the total decrements, `pp` is a list of 'R' and 'H' based on the conditions met during the loop, and `rr` and `hh` are arrays reflecting the number of times specific conditions were met.***
