The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined in the given state, it implies that `pp` is a new list being created or an existing list that is being modified. The value of `pp` after appending `'R'` will be `[ 'R' ]`.

Other variables such as `i`, `rr`, `hh`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'E', `rr[2]` is False, `rr[3]` is the original value of `rr[3]` + 1, `hh[2]` is False, `r` is the original value of `r` + 1, `pp` is [ 'R' ]**
