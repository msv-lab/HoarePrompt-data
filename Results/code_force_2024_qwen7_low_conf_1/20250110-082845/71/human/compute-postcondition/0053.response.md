The code `result.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `result`. Since `result` was initially an empty list, after appending `'R'`, `result` will contain the element `'R'`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` is the number of 'N' in the string `s`, `count_south` is the number of 'S' in the string `s`, `count_east` is the number of 'E' in the string `s`, `count_west` is the number of 'W' in the string `s`, `count_north` equals `count_south` and `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` is a list containing ['R'], `i` is 1, the character at index `i` in `s` is 'E'**
