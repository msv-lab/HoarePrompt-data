The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. The variables `hh[3]` and `h` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated values of `hh[3]` and `h` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`hh[3]` is decreased by 1; `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing the element 'H'**
