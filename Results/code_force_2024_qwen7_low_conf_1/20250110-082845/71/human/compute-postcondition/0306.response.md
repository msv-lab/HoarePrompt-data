Postcondition: ***`hh` and `rr` are lists, and `pp` is a list containing either ['R'] or ['H']. If `hh[3]` is truthy, then `hh[3]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H']. If `rr[3]` is true and `r >= h`, then `rr[2]` is increased by 2, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1, and `pp` remains ['H'].***
