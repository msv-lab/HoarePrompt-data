The code initializes `count_south` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, or `count_north`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `count_south`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of instructions, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' representing the sequence of instructions, `count_north` is 0, `count_south` is 0.**
