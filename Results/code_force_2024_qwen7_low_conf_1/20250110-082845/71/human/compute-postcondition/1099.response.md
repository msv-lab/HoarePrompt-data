The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initialized before this operation, it is considered an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'`, `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

- `t` remains unchanged and is still 2.
- `i` is the next character in `l`, which is unaffected by the code.
- `pp` is updated to contain `'R'`.
- `r` remains unchanged and is still 2.
- `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', but since `i` is the next character in `l` and no information about `l` is given, we cannot determine if `h` has been incremented.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2; `i` is the next character in `l`; `pp` is ['R']; `r` is 2; `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'.

Output State: **`t` is 2; `i` is the next character in `l`; `pp` is ['R']; `r` is 2; `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'**
