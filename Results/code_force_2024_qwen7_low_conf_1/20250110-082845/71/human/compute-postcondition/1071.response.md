`pp` appends the string `'H'` to its list. Since `pp` was previously adjusted based on the value of `i`, and `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` now includes this new character. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list containing the elements it had before plus `'H'`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is either 1 or 2, `hh` is [0, 0, 1].

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list containing the elements it had before plus `'H'`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is either 1 or 2, `hh` is [0, 0, 1]**
