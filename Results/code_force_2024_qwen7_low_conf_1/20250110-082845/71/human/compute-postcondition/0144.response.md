The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since the initial value of `r` is less than the initial value of `h`, the new value of `r` will be the original value of `r` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'N', `rr[0]` is 1, `rr[1]` is False, `hh[1]` is False, and `r` is the original value of `r` plus 1.**
