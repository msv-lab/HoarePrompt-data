`w` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is an integer, `ss` is an integer, `ww` is an integer, `ee` is an integer, `i` is 'W', `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, `pp` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `s` is 0, `w` is 1, `e` is 0, `i` is not equal to 'S'.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is an integer, `ss` is an integer, `ww` is an integer, `ee` is an integer, `i` is 'W', `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, `pp` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `s` is 0, `w` is 1, `e` is 0, `i` is not equal to 'S'.**
