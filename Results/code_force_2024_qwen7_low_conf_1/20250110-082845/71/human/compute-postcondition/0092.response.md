Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `result` is a list containing only 'R' or 'H' based on the final character processed in the string, `i` is `len(s)`, `count_north` equals `count_south` and is non-negative, `count_east` equals `count_west` or `count_west - 1` and is non-negative, `count_north` and `count_south` represent the number of remaining 'N' and 'S' respectively, `count_east` and `count_west` represent the number of remaining 'E' and 'W' respectively, and the loop executes exactly `n` times.**
