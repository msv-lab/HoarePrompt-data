The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The initial value of `r` is 1 (as given in the initial state), so after executing the code, `r` will be 2. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, `h`, and `rr[1]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is 2, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[1]` is decreased by 1**
