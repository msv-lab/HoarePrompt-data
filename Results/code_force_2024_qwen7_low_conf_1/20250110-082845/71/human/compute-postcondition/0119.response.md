Postcondition: ***`i` is a string equal to 'E', `ee` is an even number, `h` and `r` may change depending on the condition `ee`. If `ee` is True, `h` is increased by 1, and `r` does not change. If `ee` is False, `r` and `h` may change as follows: if `rr[2]` is True, `r` is incremented by 1 and `rr[3]` is incremented by 1; if `rr[2]` is False, `r` and `rr[3]` do not change, and `h` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `r < h`, `r` remains unchanged and `h` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `r` remains unchanged. The list `pp` becomes `['R']` if `r < h` and `['H']` otherwise.***
