The code snippet `rr[1] += 1` increments the value at index 1 of the list `rr` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `rr[1]`, we denote its original value as `v`. After the increment operation, the value at `rr[1]` becomes `v + 1`. The other elements of the list `rr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rr[1]` is `v + 1`, where `v` is the original value of `rr[1]`**
