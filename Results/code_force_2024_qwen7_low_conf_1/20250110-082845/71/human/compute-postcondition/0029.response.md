The code increments `count_east` by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0, and `s` is still a string of length `n`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the counts (`count_north`, `count_south`, `count_west`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n`; `i` is incremented by 1; `count_east` is incremented by 1; `count_north` remains unchanged; `count_south` remains unchanged; `count_west` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n`; `i` is incremented by 1; `count_east` is incremented by 1; `count_north` remains unchanged; `count_south` remains unchanged; `count_west` remains unchanged.**
