The code snippet `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `m`, `l`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `hh`, and the relationship between `h` and `hh`. 

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` now contains the elements it previously had plus `'H'`, `hh` is the same except that `hh[2]` is reduced by 1, `h` is increased by 1.**
