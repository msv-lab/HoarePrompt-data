Postcondition: ***`i` is a string, and it is either 'N', 'S', or 'E'. If `i` is 'E', `ee` is an even number, `h` and `r` may change based on the condition `ee`: 
- If `ee` is True, `h` is incremented by 1 and `r` remains unchanged.
- If `ee` is False, `r` and `h` may change as follows: if `rr[2]` is True, `r` is incremented by 1 and `rr[3]` is incremented by 1; if `rr[2]` is False, `r` and `rr[3]` remain unchanged, and `h` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `r < h`, `r` remains unchanged and `h` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `r` remains unchanged. The list `pp` becomes `['R']` if `r < h` and `['H']` otherwise.
- If `i` is 'N', `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is adjusted based on the parity of `r` and the value of `nn`, and `nn` is updated. If `nn` is true and `r` is odd, `h` is increased by 1; if `nn` is true and `r` is even, `h` is increased by 1; if `nn` is false, `h` remains unchanged. `r` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1 if `ss` is true, and `pp` is updated accordingly. If `ss` is true, `pp` is ['H']; if `ss` is false, `pp` remains the same. `rr[0]` and `hh[0]` are updated based on the value of `rr[1]` and `hh[1]`, and `rr[1]` is 1 if `ss` is true and `hh[1]` is True; otherwise, `rr[1]` is 1 and `hh[1]` is True. The state of other variables remains the same.
- If `i` is 'S', `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1 if `ss` is true, and `pp` is updated accordingly. If `ss` is true, `pp` is ['H']; if `ss` is false, `pp` remains the same. `rr[0]` and `hh[0]` are updated based on the value of `rr[1]` and `hh[1]`, and `rr[1]` is 1 if `ss` is true and `hh[1]` is True; otherwise, `rr[1]` is 1 and `hh[1]` is True. The state of other variables remains the same.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block based on the value of `i` and the conditions specified in the if and else parts.
