`h` is incremented by 1, but the value of `i` and its impact on `pp` and `hh` are not specified. The value of `r` remains 2, and the state of `hh` remains undefined. The precondition that `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W' is still valid.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is 2, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh` is undefined and its first element is decreased by 1.**
