`count_north` is decremented by 1. The initial state tells us that `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `s` is a string, `result` is either `['R', 'R']` or `['H', 'R']`, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, `count_north` is decreased by 1 if `s[i]` is 'N', `count_south` is decreased by 1 if `s[i]` is not 'N', `count_east` is one less than its initial value if `s[i-1] == 'E'`, otherwise `count_west` is decreased by 1. After executing `count_north -= 1`, the only change is to `count_north`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `s` is a string, `result` is either `['R', 'R']` or `['H', 'R']`, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, `count_north` is decreased by 1, `count_south` is decreased by 1 if `s[i]` is not 'N', `count_east` is one less than its initial value if `s[i-1] == 'E'`, otherwise `count_west` is decreased by 1**
