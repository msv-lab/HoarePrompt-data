The code snippet `hh[3] += 1` increments the value at index 3 of the list `hh` by 1. However, the initial value of `hh[3]` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `hh[3]` without that information. But we know that `hh[3]` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`hh[3]` is incremented by 1**
