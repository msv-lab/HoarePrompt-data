The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state where `r` is incremented by 1, the new value of `r` will be the original value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1 (new value is `r + 1`), `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[2]` is incremented by 1**
