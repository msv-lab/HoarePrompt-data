The code assigns the value 0 to `count_west`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `count_north`, `count_south`, or `count_east`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of instructions, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' representing the sequence of instructions, `count_north` is 0, `count_south` is 0, `count_east` is 0, `count_west` is 0.**
