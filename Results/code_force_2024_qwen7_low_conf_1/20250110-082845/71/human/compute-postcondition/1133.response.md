`r` is incremented by 1, which means `r` now holds the value of its original value plus 1. The original value of `r` was not specified, but it is now increased by 1. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, `h`, and `rr`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is increased by 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr` is [0, 1]**
