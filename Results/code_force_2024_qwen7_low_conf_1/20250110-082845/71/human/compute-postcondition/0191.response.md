Postcondition: ***`i` is a string. If `i` is 'W', `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` are updated according to the initial conditions of `ww` and `rr[3]`. If `i` is 'N', `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` are updated based on the values of `nn` and `ss`. If `i` is 'S', `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` are updated similarly. If `i` is 'E', `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` are updated based on the value of `ee`.***

This summary captures the overall postcondition by covering all the specified cases for the if and else parts, ensuring that the final state of the variables is described comprehensively.
