Postcondition: **`hh` is a list with at least one element, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element 'H'. If `hh[1]` is `val - 1`, then `h` is further increased by 1, `pp` is updated to contain the element 'H', and `r` and `h` are such that if `r < h`, then `rr[0]` is `some_value + 1`, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is updated to ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[0]` is `initial_value + 1`, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` remains as ['H'].**
