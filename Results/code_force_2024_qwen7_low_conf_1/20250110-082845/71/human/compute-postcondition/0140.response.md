The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `pp`, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'H'`, the list `pp` will contain `'H'`.

Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is False, `hh[1]` is False, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` contains ['H']**
