Postcondition: ***`i` is 'S' and is not 'N' or 'E', `rr[0]` is False, `rr[1]` is 1 if `r` was less than `h`, `hh[0]` is False, `hh[1]` is True if `r` was not less than `h`, `r` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition, `pp` is `['R']` if `r` was less than `h`, and `pp` is `['H']` if `r` was not less than `h`***
