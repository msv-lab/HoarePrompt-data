`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means the user will input an integer and `m` will hold this integer value. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is a non-empty sequence, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `nn` is the final count of 'N' in `l` after processing, `ss` is the final count of 'S' in `l` after processing, `ww` is the final count of 'W' in `l` after processing, `ee` is the final count of 'E' in `l` after processing, and `m` is the integer input by the user.**
