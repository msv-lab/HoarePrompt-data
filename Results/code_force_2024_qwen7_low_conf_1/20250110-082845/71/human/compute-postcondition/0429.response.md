Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is a string, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, and `i` is the last character in the string `l`. If `w > e`, then `ww` is the difference between the total count of 'W' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, and `ee` is 0. Otherwise, `ww` is 0 and `ee` is `e - w`.***
