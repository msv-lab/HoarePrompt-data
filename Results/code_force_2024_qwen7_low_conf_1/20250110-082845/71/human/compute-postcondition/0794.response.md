Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string (or an empty string if it was empty before), `t` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `nn` is the integer, `ss` is the integer, `ww` is the integer, `ee` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is 2 if `i` is 'N', `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S' and 0 otherwise, `w` is 1 if `i` is 'W' and 0 otherwise, `e` is 0, `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, `pp` is an empty list.***

Explanation:
- If the condition `i == 'N'` is true, then `n` is set to 2.
- If the condition `i == 'N'` is false, then `ee` is set to either 0 or 1 (since it is mentioned that `ee` is either 0 or 1 in the else part).

Thus, regardless of whether the condition `i == 'N'` is true or false, the final state of the variables satisfies the given postconditions.
