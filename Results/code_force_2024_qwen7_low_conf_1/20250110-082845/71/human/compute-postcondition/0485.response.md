`pp` is an empty list before the code execution. The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is not `e - w`, the current value of `i` is 'E', `r` is 1 more than its original value, `h` is 0, `rr` is a list of four values `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`, and the last character in the string `l` is not 'W'.
