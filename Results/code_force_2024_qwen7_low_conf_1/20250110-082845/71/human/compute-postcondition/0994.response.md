The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The list `pp` did not exist before this line of code, so it is now initialized with one element `'H'`.

- `l` is a non-empty string.
- `t` is 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0.
- `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`.
- `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`.
- `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`.
- `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`.
- `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`.
- `e` is the count of any other character in `l`.
- `h` is increased by 1.

Since no other variables are affected, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, and `h` is `h + 1`; `pp` is ['H'].**
