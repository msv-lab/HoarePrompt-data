Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is either the original list with an additional element `'R'` or a list containing one element `'H'`, `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values, with `rr[0]` being increased by 1 if `r < h` and `hh[0]` being increased by 1 otherwise.***
