The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not initially defined as a list, we assume it is initialized within the context of this snippet or is a list that already exists. The other variables `t`, `i`, `r`, and `h` are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is 2
- `i` is the next character in `l`
- `pp` is now a list containing the elements it had before plus the string `'R'`
- `r` is increased by 1
- `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'

However, since `pp` was appended to and its previous content is not specified, we only know that it contains one more element (the string `'R'`). We cannot specify the exact content of `pp` without knowing its initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list containing elements it had before plus `'R'`, `r` is increased by 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'**
