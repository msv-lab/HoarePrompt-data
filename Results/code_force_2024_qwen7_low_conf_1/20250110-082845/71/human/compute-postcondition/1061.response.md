`r` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `r` was 1 (since `i` is the next character in `l`, which means it was incremented once before), so now `r` is 2. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is 2, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[3]` is decreased by 1**
