`r` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state only mentions that `rr[0]` is increased by 1, and there is no direct relationship between `rr[0]` and `r`, the value of `rr[0]` remains unchanged. The value of `r` is now increased by 1.

Output State: **`rr[0]` is increased by 1; `r` is increased by 1**
