The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', this increment is independent of the condition and happens regardless. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, `r`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2; `i` is the next character in `l`; `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`; `r` is incremented by 1; `h` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is 2; `i` is the next character in `l`; `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`; `r` is incremented by 1; `h` is incremented by 1**
