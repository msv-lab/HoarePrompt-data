The code snippet appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. However, the initial state does not specify what `pp` is, only that `pp.append('R')` is executed. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 'S'
- `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E'
- `r` is `r + 1`, which implies `r` is incremented by 1 (but the specific value of `r` is not given, so we keep it as `r + 1`)
- `ss` is true and the value of `ss` is an odd number

After executing `pp.append('R')`, the list `pp` will have the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E', `r` is `r + 1`, `ss` is true and the value of `ss` is an odd number, `pp` is ['R']**
