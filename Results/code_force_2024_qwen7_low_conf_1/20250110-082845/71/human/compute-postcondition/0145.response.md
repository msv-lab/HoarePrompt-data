`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `rr[0]`, `rr[1]`, `hh[1]`, or `r`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that `pp` now contains the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`i` is 'N', `rr[0]` is 1, `rr[1]` is False, `hh[1]` is False, `r` is the original value of `r` plus 1, `pp` is a list containing ['R']**
