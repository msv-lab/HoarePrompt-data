The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. The initial state indicates that `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. However, since no condition checking is performed within the code snippet, `h` is simply incremented by 1 regardless of the value of `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, `r`, and `hh`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh`'s first element is incremented by 1.**
