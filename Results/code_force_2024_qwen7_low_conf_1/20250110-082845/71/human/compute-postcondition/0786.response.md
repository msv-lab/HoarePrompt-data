Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is an integer, `ss` is an integer, `ww` is an integer, `ee` is an integer. If `i` is 'N', `n` is 1, `s` is 0, `w` is 0, and `e` is 0. If `i` is 'S' or an empty string, `n` is 0, `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S' and 0 otherwise, `w` is 1 if `i` is 'W' and 0 otherwise, and `e` is 0. `i` is not equal to 'N'. `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, and `pp` is an empty list.***
