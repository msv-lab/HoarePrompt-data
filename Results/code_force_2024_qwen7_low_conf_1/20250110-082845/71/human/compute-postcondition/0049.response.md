The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0 or 1. After incrementing, `i` will be 1 or 2 respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` equals `count_south` and `count_north` is a positive integer, `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` is a list containing 'R' or 'H', `i` is 1 or 2.**
