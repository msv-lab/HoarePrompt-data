`r` is incremented by 1. The initial state shows that `rr[0]` is the value of its previous value - 1, but this does not affect the value of `r`. After executing `r += 1`, the value of `r` is updated, while `rr[0]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`rr[0]` is the value of its previous value - 1; `r` is its previous value + 1**
