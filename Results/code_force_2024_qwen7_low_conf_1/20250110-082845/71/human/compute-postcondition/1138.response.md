Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `r` is incremented by 1. If `r` is less than `h`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, and `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. Otherwise, `pp` is a list containing elements adjusted based on the value of `i` plus `'H'`, and both `h` and `hh[1]` are incremented by 1.***
