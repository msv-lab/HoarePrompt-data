To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `t` must be at least 2.
- `m` is the integer input by the user.
- `l` is a non-empty string.
- `n` is either 1 or 0.
- `s` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is 'S'.
- `w` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is 'W'.
- `e` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is not 'W'.
- `nn` is the final count of 'N' in `l` after processing.
- `ss` is the final count of 'S' in `l` after processing.
- `ww` is the final count of 'W' in `l` after processing.
- `ee` is the final count of 'E' in `l` after processing.
- `m` is the integer input by the user.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for i in l:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `l`. The loop body is omitted, but we need to understand how the loop affects the variables at the start of each iteration.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `l`, the only variable that changes with each iteration is `i` itself. The other variables (`t`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not provided.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Character `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current character being processed. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the string `l`.
2. **Other Variables**: Since no modifications to `t`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` are mentioned, these values remain the same.

### Updated State:
At the start of the next iteration, the following should be true:
- `t` must still be at least 2.
- `m` remains the integer input by the user.
- `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` remain unchanged.
- `i` becomes the next character in the string `l`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is a non-empty string, `n` is either 1 or 0, `s` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is 'S', `w` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is 'W', `e` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character `i` is not 'W', `nn` is the final count of 'N' in `l` after processing, `ss` is the final count of 'S' in `l` after processing, `ww` is the final count of 'W' in `l` after processing, `ee` is the final count of 'E' in `l` after processing, and `i` is the next character in the string `l`.**
