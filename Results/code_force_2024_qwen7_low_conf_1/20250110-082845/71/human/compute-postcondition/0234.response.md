Postcondition: **`h` and `r` are integers. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1 and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `r` is less than `h`, then `r` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `rr[3]` is set to `rr[3] + 1`. If `r` is not less than `h`, then `h` is incremented by 1, and `hh[3]` is equal to its previous value plus 1. Additionally, `pp` is a list containing either the element 'R' or the elements ['H'].**
