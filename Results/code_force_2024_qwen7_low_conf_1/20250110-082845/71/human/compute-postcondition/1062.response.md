`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The previous value of `pp` was not specified, but it now includes the element `'R'`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list containing the elements before the current value plus `'R'`, `r` is 2, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[3]` is decreased by 1.
