Postcondition: **`nn`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` are as follows:
- If `nn` is initially odd, then `r` is `r + 1`, `h` is 2, and `pp` is `[ 'H' ]`.
- If `nn` is initially even, then:
  - If `rr[1]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains 'R', and `rr[1]` is decremented by 1.
  - If `hh[1]` is true, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is set to `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is decremented by 1.
  - If `r < h` and `hh[1]` is false, `rr[0]` is incremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
  - If neither `rr[1]` nor `hh[1]` is true and `r >= h`, `hh[0]` is set to `initial_value + 1`, `h` is set to `initial_value + 2`, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.
- `nn` is updated to `nn - 1`.**
