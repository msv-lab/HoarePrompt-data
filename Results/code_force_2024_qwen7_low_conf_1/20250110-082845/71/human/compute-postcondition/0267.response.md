`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `pp`, we can assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'`, `pp` will contain the element `'R'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rr[0]` is `v - 1`, `total` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0, `r` is 1, `pp` contains `'R'`**
