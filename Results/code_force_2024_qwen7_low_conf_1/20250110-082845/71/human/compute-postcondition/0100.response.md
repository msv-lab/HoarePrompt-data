`r` is incremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was initially to `r + 1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still the string 'E'. The value of `rr[2]` remains unchanged and is still 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 'E', `r` is `r + 1`, `rr[2]` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 'E', `r` is `r + 1`, `rr[2]` is 0**
