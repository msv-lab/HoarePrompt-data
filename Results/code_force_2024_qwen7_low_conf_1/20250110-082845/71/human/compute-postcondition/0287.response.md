`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The initial state indicates that `r` is `r_initial + 1`, and other variables remain unchanged. After executing the code, the value of `r` remains unchanged, and `pp` gains the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`r` is `r_initial + 1`, `pp` is `[<previous pp content>, 'R']**
