The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state where `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, and `r` is incremented by 1, the value of `r` will be increased by 1. The value of `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', but since the condition is not checked in the given code, the value of `h` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `t` is still 2
- `i` is still the next character in `l`
- `pp` is still adjusted based on the value of `i`
- `r` is increased by 1
- `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is increased by 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'**
