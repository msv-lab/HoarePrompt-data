`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `r` was previously 0, so now `r` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is 'N', `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is a list of [0, 0, 0, 0], `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is an empty list, the last character in the string `l` is not 'E', and `nn` is 0.
