Postcondition: ***`rr` is a list, `r` is an integer, `h` is an integer, `pp` is a list, and `hh` is a list. If `rr[2]` is `True`, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` has an additional element `'R'`, and `rr[3]` is set to `rr[3] + 1`. If `hh[2]` is `True`, then `h` is increased by 1 and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h`, then both `r` and `h` are increased by 1, `rr[3]` is set to `rr[3] + 1`, and `hh[2]` remains unchanged. If `r` is not less than `h`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `hh[3]` is set to `hh[3] + 1`. In all cases, `pp` is a list containing either the element `'R'` or the elements `['H']`.***
