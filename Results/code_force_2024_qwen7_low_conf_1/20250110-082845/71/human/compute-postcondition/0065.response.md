`result` is a list, and the code appends the string `'H'` to it. The value of `n` remains unchanged since no operation is performed on it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3; `result` is a list containing the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3; `result` is ['H']**
