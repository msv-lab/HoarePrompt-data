`h` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `h` before the increment is not given. Therefore, the only change is that `h` is increased by 1. The other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`hh[1]` is `val - 1`, `hh` is a list with at least two elements, `h` is increased by 1**
