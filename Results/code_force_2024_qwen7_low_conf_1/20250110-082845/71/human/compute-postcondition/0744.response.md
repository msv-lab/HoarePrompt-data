The code snippet `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. No other variables are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is at least 2
- `m` is the integer input by the user
- `l` is one character shorter
- `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`
- `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`
- `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`
- `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`
- `r` is increased by 1
- `h` may change in terms of their values
- `pp` may change in terms of its contents
- `rr[0]` is decreased by 1
- `hh` may change in terms of their values

After executing the code snippet, the only change is that `'R'` is appended to `pp`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `r` is increased by 1, `h` may change in terms of their values, `pp` is `pp` plus the element `'R'`, `rr[0]` is decreased by 1, `hh` may change in terms of their values.**
