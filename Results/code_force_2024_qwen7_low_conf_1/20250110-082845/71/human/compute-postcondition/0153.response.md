Postcondition: ***`i` is a string and equals 'N'. `r` is incremented by 1 regardless of the value of `nn`. If `nn` is true and `r` is odd, `h` is increased by 1. If `nn` is true and `r` is even, `h` is increased by 1. `nn` is updated to `nn - 1`. `pp` is either ['R'] or ['H']. `rr[1]` is False. If `r < h`, `rr[0]` is set to 1 and `hh[0]` is set to 2. Otherwise, `rr[0]` remains 0 and `hh[0]` is 2. The state of other variables remains the same.***
