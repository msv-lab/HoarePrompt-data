`h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `hh[3]` is decreased by 1. The value of `h` is increased by 1, but the specific value of `hh[3]` is not given, so we only know it has been decreased by 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`hh[3]` is decreased by 1; `h` is increased by 1**
