The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The initial state shows that `r` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `r` is its initial value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the updated value of `r` is `2 + 1 = 3`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, and `h`) retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is 3, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'**
