Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, and `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`. `r` is incremented by 1. `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', otherwise `h` is 3. If `nn` is even, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i` with the second element possibly decreased by 1 depending on `hh[1]`, and `rr[0]` is increased by 1 if `rr[1]` is true. If `nn` is odd, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i` with the last element being 'R' if `rr[0]` is false, and `r` is incremented by 1 with `h` incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. If `r` is less than `h`, then `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i` plus `'H'`, and both `h` and `hh[1]` are incremented by 1.***
