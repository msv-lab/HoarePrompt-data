The code `rr[1] += 1` increments the second element of the list `rr` by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the value of `rr[1]` changes from its original value to the original value plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character (now shorter by one), `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the new last character in the string `l`, `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1, `rr` is a list of four integers with the second element incremented by 1, and `hh` is a list of four integers.**
