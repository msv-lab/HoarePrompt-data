`pp` is appended with the string 'H', which means the list `pp` gains an additional element 'H'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list containing 'H', `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[2]` is one less than its original value.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is ['H'], `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[2]` is one less than its original value**
