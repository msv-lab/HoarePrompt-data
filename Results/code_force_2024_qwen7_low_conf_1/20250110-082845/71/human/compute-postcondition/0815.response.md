The code `print('NO')` does not affect any of the variables; it only prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`) or 0, `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `i` is the last character in `l`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, and `pp` is an empty list. A value 'NO' is printed to the console.**
