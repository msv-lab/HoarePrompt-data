The code appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was initially an empty list, after appending `'H'`, `pp` becomes `['H']`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the last character in the string `l` and `i` is 'S', `r` is 0, `h` is 1, `rr` is a list of four zeros, `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is `['H']`, and the last character in the string `l` is 'S'. The value of `ss` is even.**
