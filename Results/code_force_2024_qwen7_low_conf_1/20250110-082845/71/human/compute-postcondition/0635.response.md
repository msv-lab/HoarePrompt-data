The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the only affected variable is `pp`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character (now shorter by one), `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the new last character in the string `l`, `r` is `1` more than its original value, `h` is either 0 or 1, `pp` is now a list containing the element `'R'`, `rr` is a list of four integers where the first element is `rr[0] + 1`, and `hh` is a list of four integers.**
