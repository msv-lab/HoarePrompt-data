Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list that includes at least one element from its initial state plus either `'H'` or `'R'`, `r` is incremented by 1 (making it 3), `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W' (making it 3 if `i` is 'W' and 2 otherwise), and `hh[3]` is either decreased by 1 or `hh[2]` is incremented by 1 depending on the condition evaluated.***
