Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`) or 0, `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`. If `rr[2]` is 0, then `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is `['R']`. If `rr[2]` is not 0, then if `hh[2]` is True, `h` is 1, `hh` is `[0, h_value - 1, hh[2] - 1, hh[3]]`, and `pp` is `['H']`. Otherwise, `r` is 0, `h` is 0, `rr` remains `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, and `pp` becomes `['H']`.***
