The code appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify what `pp` is, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'H'`, `pp` becomes `['H']`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is False, `hh[0]` is 2, the condition r >= h is true, and pp is ['H']**
