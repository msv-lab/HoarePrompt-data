Postcondition: ***`hh[3]` is decreased by 1; `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing the element 'H'. If `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is the original value of `rr[2]` plus 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains at least one additional element `'R'`. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is `['H']`.***
