The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since `h` was previously `False`, which in Python is equivalent to 0 when used in arithmetic operations, incrementing it by 1 results in `h` being 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is a string and the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`i` is a string, and `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E'; `h` is 1**
