The code snippet `rr[3] += 1` increments the fourth element (index 3) of the list `rr` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the initial value of `rr`. Since no specific initial value is given for `rr`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `rr[3]`, but we know it has been incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, `r`, and `h`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[3]` is incremented by 1**
