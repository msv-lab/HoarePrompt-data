The code `hh[1] -= 1` decrements the value at index 1 of the list `hh` by 1. Given the initial state where `hh[1]` is `True`, and considering that in Python, the boolean `True` is equivalent to `1`, we subtract 1 from `True`, resulting in `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string, `i` is not equal to 'E' and the current value of `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is False, and the value of `hh[1]` is False**
