`rr[1]` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `rr[1]` is not specified, but since the condition `rr[1]` is true, it means `rr[1]` is a positive integer. After decrementing by 1, the value of `rr[1]` will still be a positive integer (since it was true before and we just decremented it by 1). The states of the other variables (`i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string, `i` is not equal to 'E', the current value of `i` is 'N', and the state of other variables remains the same, and the value of `rr[1]` is one less than its original value which was true.**
