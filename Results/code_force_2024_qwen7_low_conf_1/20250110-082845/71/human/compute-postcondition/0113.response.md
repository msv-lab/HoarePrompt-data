The code `hh[3] += 1` increments the value at index 3 of the list `hh` by 1. Given the initial state where `hh[2]` is False, the value of `hh[3]` is unspecified, and the condition `r >= h` is true, the value of `hh[3]` will be incremented by 1.

Since no specific initial value for `hh[3]` is given, we can only state that it is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.

Output State: **`i` is a string and equal to 'E', `rr[2]` is False, `hh[2]` is False, `hh[3]` is `hh[3] + 1`, and the condition `r >= h` is true**
