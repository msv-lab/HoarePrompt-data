Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `s` is a string, `result` is either `['R', 'R']`, `['H', 'R']`, `['H']`, or `['H', 'H']`, depending on the initial value of `result` and the character `s[i]`, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, `count_north` is decreased by 1, `count_south` is decreased by 1 regardless of `s[i]`, `count_east` is one less than its initial value if `s[i-1] == 'E'`, otherwise `count_west` is decreased by 1.***
