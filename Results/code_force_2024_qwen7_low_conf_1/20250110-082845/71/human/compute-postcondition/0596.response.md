Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character (now shorter by one), `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is the new last character in the string `l`, `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1, `rr` is a list of four integers, and `hh` is a list of four integers. If `hh[3]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` is a list with an additional element `'H'`. Otherwise, if `r < h`, `pp` is a list with an additional element `'R'` and the value at index 2 of `rr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pp` contains the string `'H'` appended to its existing elements, and the third element of `hh` is incremented by 1.***
