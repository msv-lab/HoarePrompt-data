Postcondition: ***`i` is either 'N' or 'S'. If `i` is 'N': 
- If `nn % 2 == 1`, then `nn` is decreased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains 'R'.
- If `nn % 2 != 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains either 'R' or 'H'.
- `rr[1]` is either `v - 1` or `val - 1`.
- If `rr[1]` is `v - 1`, then `r` is increased by 1.
- If `hh[1]` is `val - 1`, then `r` is increased by 1 and `rr[0]` is `some_value + 1`.
- Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `hh[0]` is `initial_value + 1`.
- `pp` is updated accordingly to contain either 'R' or 'H'.

If `i` is 'S': 
- `ss` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `pp` is either `['R']` or `[ 'R' ]`, `hh` is a list of at least two elements, `h` is an integer.
- If `ss` is initially odd, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is `['R']`, `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, and `h` is increased by 1.
- If `ss` is initially even, then depending on the value of `rr[0]` and the comparison between `r` and `h`:
  - If `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is `['R']`, `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1.
  - If `rr[0]` is false and `r < h`, `hh[1]` is set to `x + 2`, `r` is set to `x + 1`, and `pp` remains `['R']`.
  - If `r` is not less than `h`, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, detailing the final states of the relevant variables based on the value of `i` and the initial conditions provided.
