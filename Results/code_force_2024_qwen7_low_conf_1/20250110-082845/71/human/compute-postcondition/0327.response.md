Postcondition: ***`hh` is a list. If `hh[2]` is true, then `hh[2]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'. Otherwise, `rr[3]` is increased by 2, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R' if `r < h`. Otherwise, `hh` remains unchanged except for the value at index 3 being incremented by 2, and `pp` contains 'H'.***
