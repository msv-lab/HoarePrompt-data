Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list that includes at least one element from its initial state plus either `'H'` or `'R'`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. Depending on the condition evaluated, either `hh[3]` is decreased by 1 or `hh[2]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `ww` is one less than its initial value.***
