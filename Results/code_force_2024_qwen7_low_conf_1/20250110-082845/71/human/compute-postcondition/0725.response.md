The code snippet `pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. This affects only the variable `pp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` contains all its original elements plus `'H'`, `hh` is the same list but `hh[1]` is decreased by 1, `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values, `h` is increased by 1.**
