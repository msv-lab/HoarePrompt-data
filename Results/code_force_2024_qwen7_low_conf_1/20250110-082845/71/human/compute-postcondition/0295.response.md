The code `hh[3] -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value at index 3 of the list `hh`. However, the initial value of `hh[3]` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only say that the value at index 3 of `hh` is decreased by 1, but we cannot provide a specific numerical value.

Output State: **`hh[3]` is decreased by 1**
