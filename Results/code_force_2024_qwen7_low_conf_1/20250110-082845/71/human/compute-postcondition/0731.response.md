The code snippet `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `pp` now contains the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2; `m` is the integer input by the user; `l` is one character shorter; `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`; `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`; `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`; `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`; `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`; `pp` is a list containing one element `'H'`; `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values; `hh[0]` is increased by 1; `h` is increased by 1.**
