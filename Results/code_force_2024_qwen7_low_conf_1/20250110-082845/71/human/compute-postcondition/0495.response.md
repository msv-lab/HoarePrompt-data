The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Given the initial state, the only change is to the list `pp`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is not `e - w`, the current value of `i` is 'E', `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is [0, 0, False, 1], `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is a list containing the element 'R', and the last character in the string `l` is not 'W', `rr[2]` is False, and `hh[2]` is False, and the current value of `r` is less than the current value of `h` plus 1**
