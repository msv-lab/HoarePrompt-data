The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The initial value of `r` is such that when it is incremented by 1, it becomes `i + 1`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is `i + 1`, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[3]` is incremented by 1**
