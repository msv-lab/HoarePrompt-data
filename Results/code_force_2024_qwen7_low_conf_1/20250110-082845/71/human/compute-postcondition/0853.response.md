Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`, `ww` is 0 if `ww` is a positive integer, otherwise `ww` is a positive integer minus 1, `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is 1 if `rr[3]` is true, otherwise `r` is 0 or 1, `h` is 1 if originally `h` was 0, otherwise `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` if `ww` is a positive integer, otherwise `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 1, False]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` if `ww` is a positive integer, otherwise `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, and `pp` is ['R'] if `ww` is a positive integer and `r` was 1, otherwise `pp` is ['H'] if `ww` is a positive integer and `r` was 0, or ['R'] or ['H'] depending on whether `r < h` is true or false.***
