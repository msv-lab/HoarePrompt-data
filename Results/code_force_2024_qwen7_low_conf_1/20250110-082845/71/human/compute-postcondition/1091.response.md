`hh[3]` is incremented by 1. The value of `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. Since the value of `hh[3]` is not specified initially, we only know it has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `hh[3]` is increased by 1**
