`ee` is decremented by 1. Given that `ee` was initially an odd number, decrementing it by 1 will make it even. This means `r` is no longer 1 and instead `h` is increased by 1. Since `ee` was initially odd, let's denote it as `ee = k` where `k` is an odd number. After decrementing `ee` by 1, `ee` becomes `k - 1`, which is an even number.

Therefore, the updated conditions are: `r` is no longer 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `ee` is now an even number (`ee = k - 1`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a string equal to 'E', `ee` is an even number, `h` is increased by 1, `r` is not 1, `pp` is a list containing ['H']**
