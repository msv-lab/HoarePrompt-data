The code snippet `hh[2] -= 1` decrements the value at index 2 of the list `hh` by 1. However, the initial value of `hh` is not specified in the initial state. Without knowing the initial value of `hh[2]`, we can only state that the value at index 2 of `hh` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`hh[2]` is decreased by 1**
