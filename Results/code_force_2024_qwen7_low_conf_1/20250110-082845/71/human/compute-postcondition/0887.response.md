Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`) or 0, `ee` is either 0 or an even number, `r` is determined as follows: if `ee` was originally 0 or an odd number and became even, then `r` is 1, otherwise `r` is 0, `h` is determined similarly: if `ee` was originally 0 or an odd number and became even, then `h` is 0, otherwise `h` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]` if `rr[2]` is 0, `[0, 0, 0, 0]` if `rr[2]` is not 0 and `hh[2]` is False, and `[0, 0, 1, 0]` if `rr[2]` is not 0 and `hh[2]` is True, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` if `rr[2]` is 0, `[0, h_value - 1, hh[2] - 1, hh[3]]` if `rr[2]` is not 0 and `hh[2]` is True, and `[0, 0, 0, 1]` if `rr[2]` is not 0 and `hh[2]` is False, and `pp` is `['R']` if `ee` was originally 0 or an odd number and became even, `['H']` if `hh[2]` is True, and remains `['H']` otherwise.***
