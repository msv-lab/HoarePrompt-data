`pp` is appended with the value 'R', but the specific values of `rr[3]` and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `rr[3]` is increased by 2, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing at least one element which is 'R'.

Output State: **`rr[3]` is increased by 2, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'R'**
