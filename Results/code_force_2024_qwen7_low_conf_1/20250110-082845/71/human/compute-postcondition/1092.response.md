The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', and the code does not depend on this condition, `h` will simply be incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, `r`, and `hh[3]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is 3, `hh[3]` is increased by 1**
