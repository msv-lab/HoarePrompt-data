The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` was initially incremented by 1 in the initial state, this means `r` is incremented by 1 again. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, and `h`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is 2 (unchanged)
- `i` is the next character in `l` (unchanged)
- `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i` (unchanged)
- `r` is incremented by 1 (from its initial state where it was already incremented by 1)
- `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W' (unchanged, as no condition was met to increment `h`)

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is 2, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'**
