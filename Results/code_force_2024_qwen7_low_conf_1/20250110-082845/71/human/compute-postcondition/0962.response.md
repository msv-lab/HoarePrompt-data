The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, it means that `pp` is a new list created and the string `'R'` is appended to it. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`**
