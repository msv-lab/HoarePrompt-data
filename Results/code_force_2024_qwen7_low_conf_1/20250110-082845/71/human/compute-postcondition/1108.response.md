`h` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `hh` is the same list with its second element decreased by 1, `h` is increased by 1.
