`count_west` is decremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, and `result` is a list containing the element 'H'. The value of `count_west` is not specified in the initial state, so it is assumed to be at least 1 (since decrementing it would still leave it valid as a non-negative integer).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3; `result` is a list containing the element 'H'; `count_west` is `count_west - 1`**
