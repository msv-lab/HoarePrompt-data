Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', otherwise `h` is set to 3, `pp` is either a list containing the value adjusted based on `i` and additionally `'R'` or `['H']`, `hh[2]` is one less than its original value, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1 if `i` is not 'W'.***
