`r` is incremented by 1, changing its value from the initial state of 1 (since `i` is the next character in `l` and thus `r` was initially 1). The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, and `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is 2, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'**
