The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it must be assumed to be a list before this operation. After appending 'H' to `pp`, the value of `i` remains unchanged as it is a string equal to 'S', and `h` remains 1. 

Output State: **`i` is 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N' and 'E'; `h` is 1; `pp` is ['H']**
