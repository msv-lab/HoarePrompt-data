The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The initial state is that `r` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `r` will be the initial value plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is the initial value of `r` + 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[2]` is decreased by 1.**
