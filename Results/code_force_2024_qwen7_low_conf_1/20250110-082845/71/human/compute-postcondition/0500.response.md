Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is not `e - w`, the current value of `i` is 'E', `r` is either the previous value of `r` plus 1 (if `r < h`) or greater than or equal to `h` (if `r >= h`), `h` is either 0 (if `r < h`) or 1 (if `r >= h`), `rr` is either [0, 0, False, 1] (if `r < h`) or a list of four zeros (if `r >= h`), `hh` is either a list of four zeros (if `r < h`) or a list of four zeros where `hh[3]` is 1 (if `r >= h`), `pp` is either a list containing the element 'R' (if `r < h`) or a list containing ['H'] (if `r >= h`), and the last character in the string `l` is not 'W', `rr[2]` is False (if `r < h`) or `hh[2]` is False (if `r >= h`).**
