`h` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `h` is 2 (since it may have been incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', but this condition is not checked yet), so now `h` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is 3**
