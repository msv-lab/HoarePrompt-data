`s` is incremented by 1. Initially, `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S' and 0 otherwise. After incrementing, `s` will be 2 if `i` is 'S', and 1 if `i` is not 'S'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a string with at least two characters remaining, `i` is the next character in `l`, `t` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `nn` is the integer, `ss` is the integer, `ww` is the integer, `ee` is either 0 or 1, `n` is 2 if `i` is 'N', otherwise `n` is undefined but irrelevant, `s` is 2 if `i` is 'S' and 1 otherwise, `w` is 1 if `i` is 'W' and 0 otherwise, `e` is 0, `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, `pp` is an empty list.**
