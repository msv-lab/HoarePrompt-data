The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was adjusted based on the value of `i` before this line, and no specific value of `i` was given, we know that `pp` now includes `'R'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is [adjusted value based on `i`, 'R'], `r` is increased by 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr` is [0, 1]**
