Postcondition: ***`ww` is a boolean, `r` and `h` are integers, and `pp` is a list. If `ww` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1 if `ww` was initially odd, and `pp` is updated accordingly ('['R']' if `ww` was even, 'H' if `ww` was odd). If `ww` is false, then `rr[3]` and `hh[3]` are decremented by 1, `r` and `h` are incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to contain the appropriate character ('R' or 'H'). If `r < h` after the increment, `rr[2]` is also incremented by 1, and `pp` contains an additional 'R'. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1.***
