Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial conditions**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `l`, where `i` is the current character being processed.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be a valid character in the string `l`. Since `i` is the next character in the string `l`, the string `l` must still have characters left to process.

3. **Update the relevant variables based on the current character `i`**:
   - If `i` is 'N', then `n` is set to 3.
   - If `i` is not 'N', then `n` is either 1 or 0.
   - If `i` is 'S', then `s` is set to 3, otherwise `s` is set to 1.
   - If `i` is 'W', then `w` is incremented by 1, and `e` is set to 2, otherwise `e` remains 1.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 2 (this value does not change within the loop and is irrelevant to the condition for continuing the loop).
   - `m` is the integer input by the user (this value does not change within the loop and is irrelevant to the condition for continuing the loop).
   - `l` is a non-empty string (so there must be at least one character left to process).
   - `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` are the counts of 'N', 'S', 'W', and 'E' respectively, as processed up to the previous character.
   - `i` is the next character in the string `l`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `l` is a non-empty string and we need to process the next character, `l` must still have at least one character left.
   - `i` will now be the next character in `l`.
   - Based on the value of `i`, the counts `n`, `s`, `w`, and `e` will be updated accordingly.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `t` must still be at least 2.
- `m` is the integer input by the user (unchanged).
- `l` must have at least one character left to process (i.e., it must not be empty).
- `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` will be updated based on the value of the next character `i`.
- `i` will be the next character in the string `l`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` must be at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character left, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` are updated based on the next character `i`, and `i` is the next character in the string `l`**.
