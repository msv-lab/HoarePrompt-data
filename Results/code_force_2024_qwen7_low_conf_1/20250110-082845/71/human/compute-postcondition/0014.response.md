`count_west` is incremented by 1, which means `count_west` is now `count_west + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the string `s` and its contents remain the same. The conditions for `count_north`, `count_south`, and the character `char` in `s` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'; `count_north` is 0; `count_south` is 0; `count_east` is 0; `count_west` is `count_west + 1`; the character `char` in `s` is not 'E'**
