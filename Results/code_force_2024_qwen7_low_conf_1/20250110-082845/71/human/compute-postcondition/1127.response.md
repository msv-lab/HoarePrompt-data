`r` is incremented by 1, meaning `r` is now `original r + 1`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `r`.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is original r + 1, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', and `rr` is a list where the first element is decremented by 1.**
