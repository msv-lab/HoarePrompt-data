Postcondition: ***`i` is 'S' and is not 'N' or 'E'. `rr[0]` is False. If `r` was less than `h`, then `rr[1]` is 1, `hh[0]` is False, `hh[1]` is True, and `pp` is `['R']`. If `r` was not less than `h`, then `rr[1]` is 1, `hh[0]` is False, `hh[1]` is True, and `pp` is `['H']`. Additionally, `r` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition.***
