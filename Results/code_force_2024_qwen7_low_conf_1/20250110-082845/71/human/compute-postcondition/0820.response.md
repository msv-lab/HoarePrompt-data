Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is based on iterating over each character in the string `l`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `l` is a non-empty string.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0.
   - `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`.
   - `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`) or 0.
   - `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`.
   - `i` is the last character in `l`.
   - `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`.
   - `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`.
   - `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`.
   - `e` is the count of any other character in `l`.
   - `r` is 0.
   - `h` is 0.
   - `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `pp` is an empty list.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `l`.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to the last character in `l`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, the string `l` must have at least one character (which it already is as per the initial state).
   - The variable `i` is already set to the last character in `l`, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - The loop will start from the last character and proceed to the first character. Therefore, the initial values of `n`, `s`, `w`, and `e` must be consistent with the contents of the string `l`.

### Final State Adjustment:

- Since `l` is a non-empty string, the loop can start from the last character.
- No additional adjustments are needed for `i` as it is correctly set to the last character.

### Conclusion:

State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`) or 0, `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is 0, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is an empty list.**

Since `i` is already set to the last character in `l`, no additional state needs to be adjusted.
