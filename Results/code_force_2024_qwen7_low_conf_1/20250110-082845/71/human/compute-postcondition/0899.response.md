Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is a non-positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is 0, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is an empty list, and `i` is equal to 'N'** 

Explanation: Since the condition `nn` is evaluated as `True` in the if statement, the else block is not executed. Therefore, `nn` remains 0. Additionally, since `nn` is 0, the condition `nn` is false, which means `n` is not greater than `s`. Thus, `ss` is set to `0` if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`. For `ww`, since `nn` is not true, `ww` is set to `w - e`, which could be a non-positive integer. All other variables retain their original values from the precondition.
