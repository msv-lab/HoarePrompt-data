`h` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` and its impact on `pp` and `r` are not specified. However, the initial conditions indicate that `i` is the next character in `l`, and `r` is incremented by 1. The value of `h` is incremented by 1 regardless of the value of `i`. The value of `hh[2]` is not directly affected by this code but is mentioned as one less than its original value in the precondition.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `h` is incremented by 1.
- `r` is incremented by 1 (from the initial state).

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1 (initially incremented), `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[2]` is one less than its original value**
