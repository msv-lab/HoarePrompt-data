Postcondition: **`ee`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh` are as follows: If `i == 'E'` and the conditions within the if part are met, then:
- `r` is increased by 1 if `ee` is `ee-1` and `ee-1` is odd, or if `rr[2]` is `True`, or if `r` is less than `h`.
- `h` is increased by 1 if `rr[2]` is `True`, if `r` is less than `h`, or if `r` is not less than `h`.
- `pp` is a list containing either 'R' or ['H'].
- `rr[3]` is incremented by 1 if `rr[2]` is `True` or if `r` is less than `h`.
- `hh[2]` is decremented by 1 if `hh[2]` is `True`.

If the else part is executed, then:
- `h` is increased by 1.
- `hh[3]` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `r`, `pp`, and `rr` remain unchanged.**
