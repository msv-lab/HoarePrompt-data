Postcondition: ***`rr`, `hh`, `pp`, `r`, and `h` are as follows:
- If `rr[1]` is true, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains 'R', and `rr[1]` is set to `rr[1] - 1`.
- If `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is set to `['H']`, and `hh[1]` is set to `hh[1] - 1`.
- If `r < h` and `hh[1]` is false, then `rr[0]` is increased by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
- If neither `rr[1]` nor `hh[1]` is true and `r >= h`, then `hh[0]` is set to `initial_value + 1`, `h` is set to `initial_value + 2`, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.***

This summary encapsulates all possible outcomes based on the conditions provided within the if and else blocks.
