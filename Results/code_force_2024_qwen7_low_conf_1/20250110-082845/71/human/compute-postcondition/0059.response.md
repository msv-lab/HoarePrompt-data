The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially 1 or 0, incrementing `i` by 1 results in `i` being either 2 or 1, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` equals `count_south` and is an integer, `count_east` is `count_west - 1`, `count_west` is an integer, `result` is a list containing ['R'] or ['H'], `i` is 2 or 1, the character at index `i` in `s` is 'E', 'W', 'S', or 'N'**
