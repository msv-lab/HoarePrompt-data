The code decrements `count_east` by 1. The previous value of `count_east` is equal to `count_west`. Since `count_east` equals `count_west`, and the value of `count_east` is decremented by 1, the new value of `count_east` will be one less than the original value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` equals `count_south` and is an integer, `count_east` is `count_west - 1`, `count_west` is an integer, `result` is a list containing ['R'], `i` is 1, the character at index `i` in `s` is 'E'**
