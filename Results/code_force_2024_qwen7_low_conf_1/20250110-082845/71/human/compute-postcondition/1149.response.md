Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is the sum of all increments of `r`, `h` is the sum of all increments of `h`, `nn` is the total decrement of `nn`, `ss` is the total decrement of `ss`, `ww` is the total decrement of `ww`, `ee` is the total decrement of `ee`, `pp` is a list of 'R' and 'H' based on the conditions met during the loop, `rr` and `hh` are arrays reflecting the number of times specific conditions were met, and either `r` is 0 or `h` is 0**
