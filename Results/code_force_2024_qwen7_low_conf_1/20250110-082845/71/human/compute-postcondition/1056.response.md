`h` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `h` is not specified, but it will be its original value plus 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is its original value plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is its original value plus 1**
