`pp` is appended with the value 'R', but the initial state of `r` being increased by 1 is not directly related to this operation. The state of `r` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing 'R'.

Output State: **`r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing 'R'**
