The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was initially an empty list, after appending `'H'`, `pp` will contain the element `'H'`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is 0, `h` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` with `rr[3]` being False, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` since `hh[3]` is now 0, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`.**
