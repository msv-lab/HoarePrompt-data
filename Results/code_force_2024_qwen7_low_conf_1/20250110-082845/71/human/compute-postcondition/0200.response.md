`r` is incremented by 1, while the value of `rr[3]` remains `rr[3] - 1` and the rest of the elements in `rr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `rr[3]` is `rr[3] - 1`, the rest of the elements in `rr` remain the same, and `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`rr[3]` is `rr[3] - 1`, the rest of the elements in `rr` remain the same, and `r` is increased by 1**
