The code snippet `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not provide the exact content of `pp` before this operation, we can only say that `'H'` is added to the existing list.

The values of `t`, `i`, `r`, `h`, and `hh[3]` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list containing elements from its initial state plus `'H'`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[3]` is decreased by 1**
