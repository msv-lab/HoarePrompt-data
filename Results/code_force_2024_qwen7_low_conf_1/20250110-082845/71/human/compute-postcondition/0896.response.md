`pp` is updated by appending the string `'H'` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is `n - s` because `n > s`, `ss` is 0 because `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is 0, `h` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is an empty list with `'H'` appended to it, `i` is equal to 'N', and `nn` is non-zero, `nn % 2 == 0`**
