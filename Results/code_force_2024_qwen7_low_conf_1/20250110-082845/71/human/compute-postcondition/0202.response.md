The code snippet `hh[3] -= 1` decrements the value at index 3 of the list `hh` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `hh[3]`, we will denote it as `hh[3]` initially.

After executing `hh[3] -= 1`, the value at index 3 of `hh` will be reduced by 1.

Output State: **`hh[3]` is decreased by 1**
