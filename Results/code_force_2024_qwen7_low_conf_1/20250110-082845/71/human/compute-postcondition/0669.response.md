To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions given in the problem and how they affect the variables `t`, `m`, `l`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `i`, `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, and `hh`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is at least 2.
- `m` is the integer input by the user.
- `l` has at least one character (now shorter by one).
- `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`.
- `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`.
- `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`.
- `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`.
- `i` is the new last character in the string `l`.
- `r` and `h` are either 0 or 1.
- `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'`.
- `rr` is a list of four integers.
- `hh` is a list of four integers.

We need to analyze the changes that occur based on the value of `i`:

1. **If `i == 'W'`**:
   - `(nn - ss - 1) % 2 == 1`:
     - `r` is increased by 1.
     - `pp` contains `'R'`.
     - If `rr[3]` is true, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'R'`.
     - If `hh[3]` is true, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'H'`.
     - If `r < h`, `pp` contains `'R'` and the third element of `rr` is incremented by 1.
     - Otherwise, `pp` contains `'H'` and the third element of `hh` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise:
     - `pp` contains either `'R'` or `'H'`.

2. **If `i == 'E'`**:
   - `r` and `h` may be incremented and `rr[2]`, `rr[3]`, `hh[2]`, and `hh[3]` may be modified according to specific conditions, and `pp` will contain either `'R'` or `'H'`.

3. **If `i == 'N'` and `nn % 2 == 1`**:
   - `pp` will have an additional element `'R'`.
   - If `rr[1]` is true, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'R'`.
   - If `hh[1]` is true, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'H'`.
   - If `r < h`, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains `'R'`; otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.

4. **If `i == 'S'` and `(ss - 1) % 2 == 1`**:
   - `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` has an additional element `'R'`.
   - If `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `rr[0]` is decreased by 1, and `pp` contains `'R'`.
   - If `hh[0]` is true, the second element of `hh` remains unchanged, and `pp` contains `'H'`.

5. **If `i` is neither 'N' nor 'S'**:
   - No changes are made to `r`, `h`, `pp`, `rr`, or `hh`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i`, we need to consider the general case where `i` could be any of these values. The most critical aspects to consider are the adjustments to `r` and `h` and the contents of `pp`, `rr`, and `hh`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Length of `l`**: Since `l` is shorter by one character, the length of `l` decreases by one.
2. **Values of `r` and `h`**: These values may change depending on the conditions described above.
3. **List `pp`**: This list may gain or lose elements based on the value of `i`.
4. **Lists `rr` and `hh`**: These lists may be modified based on the conditions described above.

### Adjusted States:
- `t` remains at least 2.
- `m` remains the same.
- `l` is now one character shorter.
- `nn` and `ss` will be updated based on the new character `i`.
- `ww` is updated based on the new character `i`.
- `ee` remains the same unless it changes based on the new character `i`.
- `r` and `h` may change based on the conditions described.
- `pp` may change in terms of its contents.
- `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `r` and `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` may change in terms of its contents, `rr` and `hh` may change in terms of their values.**
