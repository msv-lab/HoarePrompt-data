`pp` is an empty list before the code is executed. The code appends the string `'R'` to `pp`. Therefore, `pp` becomes a list containing `'R'`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is 'W', `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is [0, 0, 1, 0], `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is ['R'], and `hh[3]` is False.**
