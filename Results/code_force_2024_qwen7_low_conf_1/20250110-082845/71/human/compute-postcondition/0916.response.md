The value of `h` is incremented by 1. Initially, `h` is 0, so after the increment, `h` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is a non-positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is greater than or equal to `h` (now 1), `h` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is an empty list.**
