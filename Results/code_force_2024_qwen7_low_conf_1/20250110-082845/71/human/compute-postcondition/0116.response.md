Postcondition: **`i` is 'E', `rr[2]` is False, and the state of `rr[3]` and `hh[3]` depends on the condition `r < h`. If `r < h`, then `rr[3]` is the original value of `rr[3]` + 1 and `hh[3]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `rr[3]` remains unchanged and `hh[3]` is `hh[3] + 1`. Additionally, if `r < h`, then `r` is the original value of `r` + 1 and `h` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged and `h` is `h + 1`. The list `pp` becomes `['R']` if `r < h` and `['H']` otherwise.**
