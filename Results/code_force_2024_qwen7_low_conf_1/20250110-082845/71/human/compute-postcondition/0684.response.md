`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was previously undefined or unspecified in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'`, the list `pp` now contains the single element `'R'`.

The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is one character shorter, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is adjusted based on the new character `i`, `ee` is `e - w - 1` if `ee` is true, otherwise `ee` is `e - w`, `r` is increased by 1, `h` may change based on the value of `i`, `pp` is ['R'], `rr` is the same list with the third element incremented by 1, `hh` may change in terms of its values.**
