`h` is a list where the value at index 3 is the original value + 1, and all other elements remain unchanged. The code `h += 1` attempts to increment the list `h` as a whole, which is not a valid operation in Python. Instead, this line of code will add 1 to the last element of the list `h`. Therefore, the value at index 3 is updated to the original value + 2.

Output State: **`hh` is a list where the value at index 3 is the original value + 2; all other elements remain unchanged**
