`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, and `r` is incremented by 1. Since `h` was already incremented by 1, its new value depends on whether `i` equals 'W' or not, but since we only know that `h` is incremented by 1, we can represent it as `h` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1**
