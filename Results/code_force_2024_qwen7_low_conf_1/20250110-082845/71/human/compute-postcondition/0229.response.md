`pp` is appended with the string 'R'. The value of `rr[3]` is incremented by 1, and the value of `r` is also increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `rr[3]` is now `rr[3] + 1`; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` contains the element 'R'.

Output State: **`rr[3]` is now `rr[3] + 1`; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` contains the element 'R'**
