Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` and `count_south` are integers. If the current character being processed is 'N', then `count_north` is incremented by 1 and `count_south` remains 0. Otherwise, `count_south` is incremented by 1 and if the current character is 'E', then `count_west` is incremented by 1, otherwise `count_west` remains 0.***
