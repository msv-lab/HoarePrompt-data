Postcondition: ***`r` is either `r_initial + 1` or remains unchanged, `pp` is either `[<previous pp content>, 'R']` or contains the element `'H'`, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh` and `rr` are lists, and `pp` is a list containing either ['R'] or ['H']. If `ww` is true, then `r` is either `r_initial + 1` or remains unchanged, `pp` is either `[<previous pp content>, 'R']` or contains the element `'H'`, and `h` is incremented by 1. If `ww` is false, and `hh[3]` is truthy, then `hh[3]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H']. If `ww` is false and `rr[3]` is true and `r >= h`, then `rr[2]` is increased by 2, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1, and `pp` remains ['H'].***
