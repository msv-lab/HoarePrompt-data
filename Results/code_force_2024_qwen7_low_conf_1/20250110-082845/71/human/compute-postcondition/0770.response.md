`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `l`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `i`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a string, the conditions for printing 'NO' based on `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, and `ee` remain the same, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, and `ee` are integers, `i` is an empty string, `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, and `pp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a string, the conditions for printing 'NO' based on `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, and `ee` remain the same, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, and `ee` are integers, `i` is an empty string, `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, and `pp` is an empty list.**
