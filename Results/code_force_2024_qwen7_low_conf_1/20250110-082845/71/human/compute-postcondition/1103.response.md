`nn` is decremented by 1. The value of `nn` was not specified in the initial state, but it does not affect the other variables directly. The states of `t`, `i`, `pp`, `r`, and `h` are not altered by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is either a list containing elements adjusted based on the value of `i` (plus the string `'H'` if applicable) or `['R']` if `nn % 2 == 1`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', otherwise it may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `nn` is decreased by 1.**
