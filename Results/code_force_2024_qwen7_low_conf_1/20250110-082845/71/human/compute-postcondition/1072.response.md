Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list that includes at least one element from its previous state plus either `'R'` or `'H'`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', otherwise `h` is either 1 or 2, and `rr[2]` is incremented by 1 if `r < h`, otherwise `hh` is [0, 0, 1].***
