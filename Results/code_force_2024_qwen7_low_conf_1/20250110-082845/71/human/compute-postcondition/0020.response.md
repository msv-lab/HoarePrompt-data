`count_south` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` and `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'; `count_south` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'; `count_south` is increased by 1**
