`r` is incremented by 1, and `rr[3]` is increased by 1. The value of `rr[3]` was previously one more than its current value because it was increased by 1 before the code snippet. Therefore, the new value of `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1, and `rr[3]` is now two more than its original value.

Output State: **`rr[3]` is increased by 2, `r` is increased by 1**
