The code appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a list. The value of `pp` changes to include 'H'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 'S', `i` is not 'N' and 'E', `rr[0]` is False, `hh[0]` is False, `hh[1]` is True, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['H'].

Output State: **`i` is 'S', `i` is not 'N' and 'E', `rr[0]` is False, `hh[0]` is False, `hh[1]` is True, `h` is 2, `pp` is ['H']**
