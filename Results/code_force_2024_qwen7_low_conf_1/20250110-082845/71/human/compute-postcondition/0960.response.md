To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues based on the value of `i`. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `l` is a non-empty string.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0.
   - `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`.
   - `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`.
   - `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`.
   - `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`.
   - `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`.
   - `e` is the count of any other character in `l`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `i` in `l`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Continuation**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left to process in `l`.
   - Therefore, the condition for the loop to continue is `len(l) > 0`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the length of `l`, we need to adjust `l` to ensure it still has characters left to process.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must still be a non-empty string.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `l` itself, ensuring it remains a non-empty string.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`.**
