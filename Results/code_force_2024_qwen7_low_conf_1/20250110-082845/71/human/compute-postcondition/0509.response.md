The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Before the execution, `pp` is an empty list. After appending `'R'`, `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

The values of all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l` (non-zero and odd), `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is `e - w`, `i` is 'N', `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is a list of four zeros, `hh` is a list of four zeros, `pp` is a list containing 'R', and the last character in the string `l` is not 'E'.**
