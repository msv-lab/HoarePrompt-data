The code `rr[3] -= 1` decrements the value at index 3 of the list `rr` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `rr[3]`, we can denote it as `rr[3]` before the operation and `rr[3] - 1` after the operation. The other elements of the list `rr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rr[3]` is `rr[3] - 1`, the rest of the elements in `rr` remain the same**
