Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `r` is incremented by 1. Depending on the value of `i`:
- If `i` is 'W', `pp` is a list that includes at least one element from its initial state plus either `'H'` or `'R'`, and `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. Additionally, `hh[3]` is decreased by 1 or `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, and `ww` is one less than its initial value.
- If `i` is 'E', `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', and `h` is the initial value of `h` + 1. Additionally, `hh[2]` is one less than its original value, and `hh[3]` is increased by 1.
- If `i` is neither 'W' nor 'E', `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', otherwise `h` is 3. If `nn` is even, `pp` is adjusted based on `i` with the second element possibly decreased by 1 depending on `hh[1]`, and `rr[0]` is increased by 1 if `rr[1]` is true. If `nn` is odd, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i` with the last element being 'R' if `rr[0]` is false, and `r` is incremented by 1 with `h` incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W'. If `r` is less than `h`, then `pp` is adjusted based on `i` plus `'H'`, and both `h` and `hh[1]` are incremented by 1.***
