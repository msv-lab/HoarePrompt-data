Postcondition: **`r` and `h` are integers. `rr[3]` is increased by 2, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R' if `r < h`. Otherwise, `hh` is a list where the value at index 3 is the original value + 2, all other elements remain unchanged, and `pp` is a list containing the element 'H'.**
