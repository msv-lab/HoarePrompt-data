Postcondition: **`rr[1]` is either `v - 1` or `val - 1`, `r` is increased by 1 if `rr[1]` is `v - 1`, and `h` is increased by 1. `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'`. If `hh[1]` is `val - 1`, then `r` and `h` are such that if `r < h`, then `rr[0]` is `some_value + 1`, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is updated to ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[0]` is `initial_value + 1`, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` remains as ['H'].**
