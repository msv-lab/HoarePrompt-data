Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is a non-positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`. If `hh[1]` is -1, then `r` is 1, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`. Otherwise, `r` is at least 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is `['H']`.***
