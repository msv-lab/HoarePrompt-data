The code snippet `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The previous value of `pp` is not explicitly given, but since it is not specified, we assume it was an empty list before this operation. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `r`, `h`, `rr`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is ['R'], `r` is 2, `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', `rr[1]` is decreased by 1**
