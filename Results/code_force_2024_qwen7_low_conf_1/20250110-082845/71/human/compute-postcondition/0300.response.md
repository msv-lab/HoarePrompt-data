`pp` is a list (since `pp.append('R')` indicates that `pp` is being used), and `rr` is a list where the value at index 2 is increased by 2. The code appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. The value at index 2 of `rr` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`rr` is a list where the value at index 2 is increased by 2; `pp` is a list that now contains the element 'R' appended to it.**
