The value of `r` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The output state includes the updated value of `r` and retains the values of all other variables as they were initially.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is a non-positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` is 1 (since it was originally 0 and incremented by 1), `h` is 0, `rr` is `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is an empty list.**
