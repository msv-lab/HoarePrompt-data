Postcondition: ***`i` is 'S' and is not 'N' or 'E'. Regardless of the condition, `r` is incremented by 1. If `rr[0]` is True, then `rr[1]` is 1, `hh[0]` is False, and `hh[1]` is True. If `rr[0]` is False, then `rr[1]` is 1, `hh[0]` is False, and `hh[1]` is True. The state of `pp` remains as `['R']` or `['H']` depending on the condition, and the state of other variables remains the same.***
