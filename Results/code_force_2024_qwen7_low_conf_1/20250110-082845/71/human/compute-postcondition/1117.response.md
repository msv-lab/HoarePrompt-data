Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is a list with either `'H'` or `'R'` appended to it, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', otherwise `h` may be incremented by 1, `hh` is the same list with its second element decreased by 1 if `hh[1]` is true, otherwise `hh` remains unchanged, and `rr[0]` is increased by 1.***
