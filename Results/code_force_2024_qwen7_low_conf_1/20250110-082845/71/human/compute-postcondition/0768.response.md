Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` is a string, and the following conditions hold:
- If `nn % 2 == 1` or `ss % 2 == 1` or `ww % 2 == 1` or `ee % 2 == 1`, the console prints 'NO'.
- Otherwise, `l` becomes an empty string, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, and `ee` become 0, `i` becomes an empty string, `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, and `pp` is an empty list.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block based on the given conditions.
