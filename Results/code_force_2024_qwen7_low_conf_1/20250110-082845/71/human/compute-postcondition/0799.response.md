The value of `e` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `e` is 0 (since `e` is either 0 or 1), so after executing `e += 1`, the value of `e` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a string with at least two characters remaining, `i` is the next character in `l`, `t` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `nn` is the integer, `ss` is the integer, `ww` is the integer, `ee` is 1, `n` is 2 if `i` is 'N', otherwise `n` is undefined but irrelevant, `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S' and 0 otherwise, `w` is 1 if `i` is 'W' and 0 otherwise, `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, `pp` is an empty list.**
