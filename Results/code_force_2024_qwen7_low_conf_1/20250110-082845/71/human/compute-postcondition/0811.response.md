Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `n - s` if `n > s` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n > s` or `s - n` if `n <= s`, `ww` is an integer, `ee` is an integer, `i` is the last character in `l`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `r` and `h` are either both truthy or both falsy, `rr` and `hh` are lists of four zeros, and `pp` is an empty list, and the count of 'W' in `l` is less than or equal to the count of any other character in `l`**
