The value of `r` is incremented by 1, changing from its previous state. The value of `i` remains as a string and is not equal to 'E', and specifically, `i` is 'N'. The state of other variables remains the same, and the value of `rr[1]` is one less than its original value which was true, so `rr[1]` is now false.

Output State: **`i` is a string, `i` is not equal to 'E', `i` is 'N', `r` is increased by 1, `rr[1]` is false**
