`h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` is 0, so after the increment, `h` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is the integer input by the user, `l` must have at least one character, `nn` is the difference between the total count of 'N' in `l` and the total count of 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the total count of 'S' in `l` minus the total count of 'N' in `l`, `ww` is 0, `ee` is not `e - w`, the current value of `i` is 'E', `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, `h` is 1, `rr` is a list of four zeros, `hh` is a list of four zeros where `hh[3]` is 1, `pp` is an empty list, and the last character in the string `l` is not 'W', `rr[2]` is False, and `hh[2]` is False.**
