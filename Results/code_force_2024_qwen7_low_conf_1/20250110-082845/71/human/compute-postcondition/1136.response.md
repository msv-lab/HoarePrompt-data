The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Given the initial state where `h` may be incremented by 1 if `i` equals 'W', and now `h` is incremented by 1, the value of `h` is definitely incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `pp`, `r`, and `hh[1]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `l`, `pp` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[1]` is increased by 1**
