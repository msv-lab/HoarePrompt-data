`rr` is being accessed, but since `rr` was not initialized before, this will raise an error. However, assuming `rr` is a list with at least two elements and `rr[1]` is being incremented by 1, the value of `rr[1]` will be updated.

Other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given line of code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `t` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `nn` is either `nn - 1` or 0, `ss` is either 0 if `n <= s` or `s - n` if `n > s`, `ww` is either a positive integer (`w - e`), `ee` is either 0 or `e - w`, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `rr[1]` is incremented by 1.**
