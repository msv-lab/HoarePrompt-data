Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\) and \(2(k + 1) - 2 \leq n\), and `n` must be at least 3; `cycle_length` is `2 * k - 2`; `position_in_cycle` remains the same; `expected_number` and `count` are updated based on the conditions given; `count` is `initial_count + 1` regardless of whether `expected_number` equals `x`.***
