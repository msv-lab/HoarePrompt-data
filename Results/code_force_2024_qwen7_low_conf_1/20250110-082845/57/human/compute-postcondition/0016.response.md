The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`. Given the initial state, `index` is 5, so `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[5]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1` and the return value of `func_1(n, x)`**
