The code `print(result)` prints the value of the variable `result`. However, this does not change the value of `result` or any other variable. The other variables remain in their initial states. 

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a non-empty list, `data` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `index` is at least 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `result` is printed and its value remains unchanged**
