According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `t` is at least 1
- `results` is a non-empty list (at least one element)
- `data` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements
- `index` is at least 2
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`
- `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`
- `result` is printed and its value remains unchanged

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be a non-empty list, and we move to the next element in `results`.

Since `results` is a non-empty list, it will still be a non-empty list for the next iteration unless it becomes empty. However, since the problem does not indicate that `results` changes during the loop execution, we assume it remains non-empty.

The only state that needs adjustment is the `index` value, which will increase by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a non-empty list, `data` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `index` is at least 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `result` is printed and its value remains unchanged**
