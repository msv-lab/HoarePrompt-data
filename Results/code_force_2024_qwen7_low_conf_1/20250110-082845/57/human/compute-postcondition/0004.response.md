The code initializes an empty list called `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, the output state includes all these variables with their original values, plus the new list `results` which is empty.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `n` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 for each test case, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
