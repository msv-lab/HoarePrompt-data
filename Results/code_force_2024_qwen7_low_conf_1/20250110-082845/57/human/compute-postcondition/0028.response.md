The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the function definition `def func_2():`. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `x` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).

The function processes multiple test cases, but since the function definition provided does not include these parameters, they must be passed in from outside the function scope.

Based on the given information, the function likely iterates over `t` test cases and processes pairs of integers `n` and `x` for each case, but the exact processing logic (what the function does with `n` and `x`) is not specified in the function definition.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to process a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `x`, without explicitly accepting these parameters within the function definition itself.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `x`, without explicitly accepting these parameters within the function definition.**
