According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `t` is at least 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`
- `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `index` is 5
- `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1` and the return value of `func_1(n, x)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1. Therefore, `t` will be incremented by 1.

The new states after adjusting `t` will be:
- `t` is at least 1
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[3]`
- `x` remains the integer value of `data[4]`
- `data` remains a list of strings
- `index` remains 5
- `results` remains a list containing `result_of_func_1` and the return value of `func_1(n, x)`

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1` and the return value of `func_1(n, x)`**
