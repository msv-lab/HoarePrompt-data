The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `x`. Given that `index` is 5, `data[index + 1]` corresponds to `data[6]`. The value of `data[6]` is a string, which is then converted to an integer. 

- The original value of `x` was the integer value of `data[4]`.
- After the code executes, `x` is now the integer value of `data[6]`.

All other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is 5.
- `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1` and the return value of `func_1(n, x)`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[6]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1` and the return value of `func_1(n, x)`**
