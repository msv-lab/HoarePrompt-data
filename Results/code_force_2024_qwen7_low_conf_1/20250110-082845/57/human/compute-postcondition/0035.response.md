Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `x`, both of which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). It iterates through values of `k` starting from 2 until \(2k - 2 > n\). During each iteration, it calculates the `cycle_length` as \(2k - 2\) and determines the `position_in_cycle` using \((n - 1) \% (2k - 2) + 1\). Based on the value of `position_in_cycle`, it calculates the `expected_number` either as `position_in_cycle` if `position_in_cycle` is less than or equal to `k`, or as \(2k - \text{position_in_cycle}\) otherwise. If `expected_number` equals `x`, it increments the `count` variable. After the loop completes, the function returns the `count`, which represents the total number of times `expected_number` equals `x` during the loop iterations.**

This summary covers all the relevant aspects of the function, including the iteration process, the calculation of `expected_number`, and the conditions under which `count` is incremented. It also includes the final state of the program after the function concludes, specifically the return value `count`.
