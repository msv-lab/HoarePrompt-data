The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `n`. Given that `index` is 3, this means `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1`**
