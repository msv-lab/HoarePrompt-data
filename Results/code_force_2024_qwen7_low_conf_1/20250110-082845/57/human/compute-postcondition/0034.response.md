The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `x`. Both `n` and `x` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`. The function returns a count, which is the total number of times `expected_number` equals `x` during the loop iterations.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `x`, and return the count of how many times `x` equals `expected_number` during the loop iterations.
