The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Given that `index` is 3, `index + 1` is 4. So, `x` is updated to the integer value of `data[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1`**
