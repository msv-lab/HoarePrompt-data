The code `results.append(func_1(n, x))` appends the result of the function `func_1(n, x)` to the list `results`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged, but `results` now includes the return value of `func_1(n, x)`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is at least 1
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
- `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `index` is 3
- `results` is an empty list

After executing the code, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n, x)`. Since the exact return value of `func_1(n, x)` is not specified, we denote it as `result_of_func_1`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1`**
