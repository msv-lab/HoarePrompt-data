According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1, meaning `t` is a positive integer or zero. Since `t` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, making it at least 0.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `t` must be at least 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value which was at least 1).
- `n` remains the same as it is derived from `data[1]`.
- `x` remains the same as it is derived from `data[2]`.
- `data` remains unchanged as it is a list of strings.
- `index` remains the same as it is 3 and does not change within the loop.
- `results` remains the same as it contains `result_of_func_1`.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1`**
