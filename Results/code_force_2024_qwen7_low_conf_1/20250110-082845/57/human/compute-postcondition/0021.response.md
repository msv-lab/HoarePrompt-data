To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`.
- `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is the value of `len(data)`.
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration.

### Analysis:
1. **List `results`:**
   - The loop iterates over `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.
   - Since `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration, it implies that `func_1` was called at least once.
   - This means that there must be at least one call to `func_1`, which requires both `n` and `x` to be defined and valid.

2. **Variables `n` and `x`:**
   - `n` is derived from `data[index - 2]`.
   - `x` is derived from `data[index - 1]`.
   - Both `n` and `x` must be valid integers for `func_1(n, x)` to be called successfully.

3. **Variable `index`:**
   - `index` is set to `len(data)`, meaning it represents the length of the `data` list.
   - To ensure that `data` has at least two elements (to get `data[index - 2]` and `data[index - 1]`), `index` must be at least 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `results` must contain at least one element.
- `data` must have at least two elements to define both `n` and `x`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a non-empty list, `data` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `index` is at least 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`**
