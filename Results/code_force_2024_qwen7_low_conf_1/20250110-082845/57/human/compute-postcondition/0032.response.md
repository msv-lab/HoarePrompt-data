Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\) and \(2k - 2 \leq n\), `n` must be at least 3; `cycle_length` is \(2k - 2\); `position_in_cycle` is \((n - 1) \% (2k - 2) + 1\); `expected_number` is determined based on the condition of `position_in_cycle`: if `position_in_cycle` is less than or equal to \(k\), `expected_number` is `position_in_cycle`; otherwise, `expected_number` is \(2k - \text{position_in_cycle}\); `count` is the total number of times `expected_number` equals `x` during the loop iterations; `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop has finished executing.**
