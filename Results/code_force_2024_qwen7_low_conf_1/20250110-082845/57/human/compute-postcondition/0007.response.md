`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[2]`. Since `data` is a list of strings, `data[2]` is a string. The value of `x` is converted from this string to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
