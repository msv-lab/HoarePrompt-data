The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` updates the variable `n` by converting the string at the specified index in the `data` list into an integer. The initial state specifies that `data` is a list of strings, and `index` is 1. Therefore, `n` will be assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is at least 1
- `n` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9
- `data` is a list of strings
- `index` is 1
- `results` is an empty list

After executing the code, `n` will be updated to the integer value of `data[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
