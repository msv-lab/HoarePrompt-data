The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. The previous values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged, but `data` is now a list of strings that represents the split input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 for each test case, `data` is a list of strings**
