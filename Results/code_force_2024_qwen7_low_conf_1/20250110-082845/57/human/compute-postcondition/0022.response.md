The code `print(result)` prints the value of the variable `result`. However, the value of `result` is not changed by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a non-empty list, `data` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `index` is at least 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `result` is unchanged**
