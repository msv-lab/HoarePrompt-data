Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration where `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` and `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `index` is the value of `len(data)`, `result` is the last printed value and its value remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each element.
- Since `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration, and the loop runs until all elements in `results` are processed, `results` must contain these return values.
- The loop does not modify the values of `n` and `x`, which are derived from `data`. Therefore, they remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- The loop does not modify `t`, `data`, or `index`, so these variables retain their initial or derived values.
- After the loop finishes executing, `result` will be the last value printed from the `results` list, but its value remains unchanged outside the loop.
