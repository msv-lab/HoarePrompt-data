`index` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `index` is 1, so after incrementing by 2, `index` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list**
