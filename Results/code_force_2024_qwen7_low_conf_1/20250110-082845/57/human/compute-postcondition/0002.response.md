`t` is assigned the value of the first element in the `data` list, converted to an integer using `int()`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `n` and `x` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 for each test case, `data` is a list of strings**
