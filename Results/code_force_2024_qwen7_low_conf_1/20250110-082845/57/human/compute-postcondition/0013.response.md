`index` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `index` is 3, so after the increment, `index` becomes 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_1`**
