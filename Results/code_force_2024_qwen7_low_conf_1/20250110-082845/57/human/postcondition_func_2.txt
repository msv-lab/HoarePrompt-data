The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it calls `func_1(n, x)` with `n` and `x` being positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). If the condition is met, `func_1(n, x)` is called, and its result is stored in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in `results`. If any `n` and `x` do not satisfy the condition \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), the function does not handle these cases explicitly; it simply moves to the next test case. There are no error messages generated for invalid inputs.
