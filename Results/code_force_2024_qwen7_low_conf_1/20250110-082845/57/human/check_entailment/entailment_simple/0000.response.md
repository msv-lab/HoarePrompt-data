Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `x`, which represent Vasya's position in the line and the number he received during the settling, respectively.
   - It iterates over possible values of `k` starting from 2 until `2 * k - 2` exceeds `n`.
   - For each `k`, it calculates the length of the cycle (`2 * k - 2`) and determines the position within this cycle using `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`.
   - Based on the position, it computes the expected number Vasya should receive during the settling.
   - If the expected number matches `x`, it increments the count.
   - The function returns the total count of valid `k`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - It splits the input into individual test cases and processes each one by calling `func_1`.
   - The results of `func_1` for each test case are stored in a list and then printed.

### Verification:

- **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format as specified (multiple test cases with `t`, `n`, and `x` per test case).
- **Logic Implementation**: The logic inside `func_1` correctly implements the settling pattern and checks whether the given position `x` fits the pattern for different values of `k`.
- **Output**: The program outputs the correct number of valid `k` for each test case, as per the problem description.

Since the program accurately follows the logic described in the problem statement and correctly handles all test cases, the program is correct. Therefore, the answer is `Correctness: True`.
