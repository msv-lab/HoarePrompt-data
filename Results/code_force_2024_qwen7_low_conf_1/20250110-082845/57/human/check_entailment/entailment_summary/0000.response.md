Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the "first-k-th" settling pattern by iterating over possible values of `k` starting from 2 until `2k - 2` exceeds `n`.
   - It calculates the position within the current cycle (`position_in_cycle`) and the expected number (`expected_number`) based on this position.
   - The logic for determining `expected_number` is correct, as it checks whether the position is within the first `k` or the next `k-2` positions and assigns the appropriate number accordingly.
   - The function increments the count whenever `expected_number` matches `x`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly uses `func_1` to solve each test case and collects the results in a list.
   - It prints the results in the required order after processing all test cases.
   - However, it has some potential issues:
     - It assumes that the input format is always correct and that there are exactly `2t` elements in the `data` list.
     - It does not handle invalid inputs or errors in the results returned by `func_1`.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - While `func_2` has potential issues, the core logic implemented in `func_1` appears to be correct for the problem statement.
   - Given that the problem description specifies that the answers are finite and valid inputs are assumed, the primary concern is the correctness of the algorithm itself, which seems to be correctly implemented.

Since the core logic of determining the number of valid `k` values in `func_1` appears to be correct and the rest of the program structure is designed to work around it, we can conclude that the overall program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
