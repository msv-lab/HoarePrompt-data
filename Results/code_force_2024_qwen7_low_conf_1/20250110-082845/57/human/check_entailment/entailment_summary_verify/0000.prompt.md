You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while 2 * k - 2 <= n:
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1
        if position_in_cycle <= k:
            expected_number = position_in_cycle
        else:
            expected_number = 2 * k - position_in_cycle
        if expected_number == x:
            count += 1
        k += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(func_1(n, x))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `x`. For each test case, it calls the `func_1(n, x)` function and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results in order. The function reads the input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `n` and `x`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes that the input format is correct and that there are enough elements in the `data` list to process all test cases. If there are fewer than `2 * t` elements in the `data` list, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
2. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, negative integers, or `x` not being less than `n`). It relies on the caller to ensure that the input is valid.
3. The function does not perform any error checking on the results returned by `func_1(n, x)`. It simply appends the results to the `results` list and prints them.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values based on Vasya's position `n` and the number he received during the settling `x`. 

Let's break down the solution:

1. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the cycle length as `2 * k - 2`.
2. **Position in Cycle**: It computes the position within the current cycle using `(n - 1) % cycle_length + 1`.
3. **Expected Number**: Depending on whether the position is within the first `k` positions or not, it calculates the expected number.
4. **Validation**: It checks if the expected number matches the number `x` and increments the count accordingly.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function `func_1` handles all edge cases and potential scenarios accurately. Since no specific edge cases or inputs were identified that cause the function to fail, we can conclude that the function works correctly for all provided and potential cases.
