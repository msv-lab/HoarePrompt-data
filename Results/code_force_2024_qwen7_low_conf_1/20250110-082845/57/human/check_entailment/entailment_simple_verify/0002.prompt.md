You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether `func_1` correctly calculates the number of valid `k` values based on the provided constraints and examples.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of `k` such that the settling pattern fits the given position `x` in a line of length `n`.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - Valid `k` must satisfy `k > 1`, `k >= x`, and `n >= x`.

2. **Key Points in `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` uses `get_even_divisors` to find all even divisors of `n - x` and `n + x - 2`.
   - It combines these lists of divisors into a set to remove duplicates.
   - It then iterates over these divisors, calculating `k = d // 2 + 1` and checks if `k` is valid (`k > 1` and `k >= x`).

3. **Checking `get_even_divisors`:**
   - This function finds all even divisors of a given value.
   - It checks for both direct divisors and their complements (i.e., `value // i`).

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** `n = 10`, `x = 2`
     - Possible `k` values: 2, 3, 5, 6.
     - `func_1` should return 4.
   - **Example 2:** `n = 3`, `x = 1`
     - Only possible `k` value: 2.
     - `func_1` should return 1.
   - **Example 3:** `n = 76`, `x = 4`
     - Possible `k` values: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13.
     - `func_1` should return 9.
   - **Example 4:** `n = 100`, `x = 99`
     - No valid `k` since `k` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 99, but `2k - 2` must be at least 98, which is impossible with `k <= 99`.
     - `func_1` should return 0.
   - **Example 5:** `n = 1000000000`, `x = 500000000`
     - Only possible `k` value: 2.
     - `func_1` should return 1.

Given the analysis and examples, the logic in `func_1` appears to be correct. It correctly identifies the valid `k` values by finding the appropriate divisors and filtering them based on the conditions.
