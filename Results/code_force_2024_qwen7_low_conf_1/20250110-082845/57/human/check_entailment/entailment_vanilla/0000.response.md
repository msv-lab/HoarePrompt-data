Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic to find the number of possible values of \( k \) based on the given constraints and examples.

### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Loop Initialization**: The function starts with an initial value of \( k = 2 \).
2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: It calculates the cycle length as \( 2k - 2 \).
3. **Position in Cycle**: It computes the position within the current cycle using \( (n - 1) \% (2k - 2) + 1 \).
4. **Expected Number Calculation**: Depending on the position in the cycle, it determines the expected number given by Vasya.
5. **Condition Check**: If the expected number matches the one given by Vasya, it increments the count.
6. **Increment \( k \)**: The loop continues until the cycle length exceeds \( n \).

This logic aligns with the problem statement and should correctly identify the possible values of \( k \).

### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads all input data at once, splitting it into tokens.
2. **Test Case Loop**: It processes each test case, calling `func_1` for each.
3. **Result Collection**: It collects the results of `func_1` for each test case.
4. **Output**: It prints the results for each test case.

Given that `func_1` correctly implements the logic and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1`, the overall program is designed to meet the requirements of the problem.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify a few examples to confirm the correctness:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `10 2`
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - Explanation: \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) match.
- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `3 1`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Explanation: \( k = 2 \) matches.
- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `76 4`
  - Expected Output: `9`
  - Explanation: Multiple \( k \) values from \( 6 \) to \( 17 \) match.
- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `100 99`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No \( k \) matches.
- **Example 5**:
  - Input: `1000000000 500000000`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Only \( k = 1000000000 \) matches.

Based on the analysis and verification, the given program correctly implements the logic for determining the number of valid \( k \) values.

Correctness: **True**
