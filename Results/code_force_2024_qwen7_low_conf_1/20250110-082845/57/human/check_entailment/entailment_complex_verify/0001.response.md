Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the annotated code, and the original assessment.

### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Loop Initialization**: The function starts with \( k = 2 \).
2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The cycle length is calculated as \( 2k - 2 \).
3. **Position in Cycle**: The position within the current cycle is computed using \( (n - 1) \% (2k - 2) + 1 \).
4. **Expected Number Calculation**: Depending on the position in the cycle:
   - If \( position_in_cycle \leq k \), then `expected_number = position_in_cycle`.
   - Otherwise, `expected_number = 2k - position_in_cycle`.
5. **Condition Check**: If `expected_number == x`, the count is incremented.
6. **Increment \( k \)**: The loop continues until the cycle length exceeds \( n \).

The logic in `func_1` accurately reflects the problem statement. For a given \( n \) and \( x \), it checks all possible \( k \) values starting from 2 until \( 2k - 2 > n \). This ensures that the function covers all possible \( k \) values that could satisfy the conditions.

### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads all input data at once, splitting it into tokens.
2. **Test Case Loop**: It processes each test case by calling `func_1` for each pair of \( n \) and \( x \).
3. **Result Collection**: It collects the results of `func_1` for each test case.
4. **Output**: It prints the results for each test case.

The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in bulk and processing each test case individually.

### Example Verification:
We can verify the examples provided in the original assessment:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `10 2`
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - Explanation: \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) match.
- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `3 1`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Explanation: \( k = 2 \) matches.
- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `76 4`
  - Expected Output: `9`
  - Explanation: Multiple \( k \) values from \( 6 \) to \( 17 \) match.
- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `100 99`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No \( k \) matches.
- **Example 5**:
  - Input: `1000000000 500000000`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Only \( k = 1000000000 \) matches.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the valid \( k \) values for each test case, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
1. **Input Format**: The function assumes correct input format but does not handle invalid input explicitly.
2. **Error Handling**: There is no explicit error handling for invalid inputs or mismatched data formats.

However, these issues do not affect the core correctness of the algorithm itself.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values for given \( n \) and \( x \). Both functions work as intended and handle the problem as specified.

Final: **True**
