You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while 2 * k - 2 <= n:
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1
        if position_in_cycle <= k:
            expected_number = position_in_cycle
        else:
            expected_number = 2 * k - position_in_cycle
        if expected_number == x:
            count += 1
        k += 1
    return count

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(func_1(n, x))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while 2 * k - 2 <= n:
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1
        
        if position_in_cycle <= k:
            expected_number = position_in_cycle
        else:
            expected_number = 2 * k - position_in_cycle
        
        if expected_number == x:
            count += 1
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\) and \(2k - 2 \leq n\), `n` must be at least 3; `cycle_length` is \(2k - 2\); `position_in_cycle` is \((n - 1) \% (2k - 2) + 1\); `expected_number` is determined based on the condition of `position_in_cycle`: if `position_in_cycle` is less than or equal to \(k\), `expected_number` is `position_in_cycle`; otherwise, `expected_number` is \(2k - \text{position_in_cycle}\); `count` is the total number of times `expected_number` equals `x` during the loop iterations; `k` is the final value of `k` after the loop has finished executing.
    return count
    #`The program returns count which is the total number of times expected_number equals x during the loop iterations`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `x`, both of which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). It iterates through values of `k` starting from 2 until \(2k - 2 > n\). During each iteration, it calculates the `cycle_length` as \(2k - 2\) and determines the `position_in_cycle` using \((n - 1) \% (2k - 2) + 1\). Based on the value of `position_in_cycle`, it calculates the `expected_number` either as `position_in_cycle` if `position_in_cycle` is less than or equal to `k`, or as \(2k - \text{position_in_cycle}\) otherwise. If `expected_number` equals `x`, it increments the `count` variable. After the loop completes, the function returns the `count`, which represents the total number of times `expected_number` equals `x` during the loop iterations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n and x are positive integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 for each test case.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        results.append(func_1(n, x))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is the value of `len(data)`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration where `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` and `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `index` is the value of `len(data)`, `result` is the last printed value and its value remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `x`. For each test case, it calls the `func_1(n, x)` function and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results in order. The function reads the input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `n` and `x`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes that the input format is correct and that there are enough elements in the `data` list to process all test cases. If there are fewer than `2 * t` elements in the `data` list, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
2. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, negative integers, or `x` not being less than `n`). It relies on the caller to ensure that the input is valid.
3. The function does not perform any error checking on the results returned by `func_1(n, x)`. It simply appends the results to the `results` list and prints them.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic to find the number of possible values of \( k \) based on the given constraints and examples.

### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Loop Initialization**: The function starts with an initial value of \( k = 2 \).
2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: It calculates the cycle length as \( 2k - 2 \).
3. **Position in Cycle**: It computes the position within the current cycle using \( (n - 1) \% (2k - 2) + 1 \).
4. **Expected Number Calculation**: Depending on the position in the cycle, it determines the expected number given by Vasya.
5. **Condition Check**: If the expected number matches the one given by Vasya, it increments the count.
6. **Increment \( k \)**: The loop continues until the cycle length exceeds \( n \).

This logic aligns with the problem statement and should correctly identify the possible values of \( k \).

### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads all input data at once, splitting it into tokens.
2. **Test Case Loop**: It processes each test case, calling `func_1` for each.
3. **Result Collection**: It collects the results of `func_1` for each test case.
4. **Output**: It prints the results for each test case.

Given that `func_1` correctly implements the logic and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1`, the overall program is designed to meet the requirements of the problem.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify a few examples to confirm the correctness:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `10 2`
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - Explanation: \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) match.
- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `3 1`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Explanation: \( k = 2 \) matches.
- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `76 4`
  - Expected Output: `9`
  - Explanation: Multiple \( k \) values from \( 6 \) to \( 17 \) match.
- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `100 99`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No \( k \) matches.
- **Example 5**:
  - Input: `1000000000 500000000`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Only \( k = 1000000000 \) matches.

Based on the analysis and verification, the given program correctly implements the logic for determining the number of valid \( k \) values.
