Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function correctly iterates over possible values of `k` starting from 2 until \(2k - 2 > n\).
   - It calculates the position within the cycle (`position_in_cycle`) using \((n - 1) \% (2k - 2) + 1\).
   - It correctly calculates the `expected_number` based on whether the `position_in_cycle` is within the first `k` positions or not.
   - The logic for determining `expected_number` matches the problem statement accurately.
   - The function increments the `count` variable when `expected_number` matches `x`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function reads the input correctly and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, x)` and appending the results to a list.
   - It handles the loop correctly to process all test cases.
   - The function prints the results in the correct order.

3. **Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**
   - The code assumes valid input without explicit validation checks.
   - The function relies on the caller to ensure proper input format and values.
   - No handling for invalid or unexpected input is provided.

Given the analysis, the core logic in both functions appears to correctly implement the problem requirements. However, the code lacks input validation and error handling, which could lead to runtime errors under certain conditions.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: Despite the lack of explicit input validation and error handling, the core logic of the functions is correct and meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the functions are considered correct based on their intended purpose.
