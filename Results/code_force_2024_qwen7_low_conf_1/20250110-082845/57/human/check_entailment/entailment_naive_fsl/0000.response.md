Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values based on Vasya's position `n` and the number he received during the settling `x`. 

Let's break down the solution:

1. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the cycle length as `2 * k - 2`.
2. **Position in Cycle**: It computes the position within the current cycle using `(n - 1) % cycle_length + 1`.
3. **Expected Number**: Depending on whether the position is within the first `k` positions or not, it calculates the expected number.
4. **Validation**: It checks if the expected number matches the number `x` and increments the count accordingly.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function `func_1` handles all edge cases and potential scenarios accurately. Since no specific edge cases or inputs were identified that cause the function to fail, we can conclude that the function works correctly for all provided and potential cases.
