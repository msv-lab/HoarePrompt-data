The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and a list \( p \) of integers. For each test case, it reads \( n \) integers from the user and stores them in a list \( a \). It then checks if there exists an index \( i \) (where \( 0 \leq i < n \)) such that \( a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1 \). If such an index exists, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters but uses variables like \( t \), \( n \), and \( a \) to manage its operations. After processing all test cases, the function concludes and returns nothing (as it only prints values). Potential edge cases include when \( t \) is `1` and \( n \) is `2`, ensuring the function correctly handles the smallest possible values within the specified ranges. The function also correctly handles cases where no such index \( i \) exists, ensuring the correct output of `3`.
