The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, it implies that the function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list `p` of `n` integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

The output is described with two cases:
- Case_1: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- Case_2: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `p` of integers, and return the appropriate result based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases, each including an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `p` of integers, and returns the appropriate result based on the given conditions.**
