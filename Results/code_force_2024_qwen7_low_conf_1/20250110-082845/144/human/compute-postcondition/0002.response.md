`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The input function waits for user input, which is converted to an integer using `int()`. The initial values of `t` and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 and t must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.**
