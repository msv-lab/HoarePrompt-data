The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.**
