Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \) and \( t \geq 1 \), `n` is an integer such that \( n > 0 \), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq p_i \leq n \), \( p_i \neq i \), and all \( p_i \) are distinct, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `z` is 1, `i` is \( i + 1 \). If `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[a[i] - 1] != i + 1`, no change is made to the variables and the program continues execution as usual.***
