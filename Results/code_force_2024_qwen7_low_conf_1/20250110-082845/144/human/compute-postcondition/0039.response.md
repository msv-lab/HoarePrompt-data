The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the `break` statement will simply exit the nearest loop or condition, but the values of the variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t \geq 2\), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `z` is 1, and `i` is 1**
