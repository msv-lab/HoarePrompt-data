Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t \geq 2\), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `z` is 0 because there does not exist an index `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`, and `i` is `n - 1` since no such index is found**
