The code `break` does not affect any variables and is used to exit the current loop or the most internal if statement. Given the initial state, the only impact is that we break out of the loop or if statement we were inside. All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t \geq 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(n > 0\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `z` is `1`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
