The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` from an unspecified integer to a specific integer entered by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t > 0\), `n` is an integer entered by the user, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `z` is 1 if there exists an index `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`, otherwise `z` remains 0, and `i` is `n - 1` if no such index is found, otherwise `i` is the index where the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is met.**
