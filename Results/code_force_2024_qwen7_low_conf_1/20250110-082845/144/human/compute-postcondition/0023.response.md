Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t \geq 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(n > 0\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` holds for any `i` in the range of `n`, and `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations without finding a match, otherwise `i` is the index where the condition was met; 2 is printed if `z` is 1, and 3 is printed if `z` is 0.***
