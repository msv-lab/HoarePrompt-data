According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Given the constraints, `t` must be in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, but specifically for the loop to execute, `t` needs to be greater than or equal to 1.

Since the loop runs `t` times and `t` is given as an integer between 1 and 5000, the only state adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 and t must be greater than or equal to 1, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.**
