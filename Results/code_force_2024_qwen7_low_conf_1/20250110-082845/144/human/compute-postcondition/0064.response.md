Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t > 0\), `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and \(p_i \neq i\), `z` is 1 if there exists an index `i` such that `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`, otherwise `z` is 0, `i` is the index where `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is met (if any such index exists, otherwise `i` remains `n - 1`, `a` is updated with integers entered by the user.**
