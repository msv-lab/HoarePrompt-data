Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t \geq 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(n > 0\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `z` is `1`, `i` is `0`, and if the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true, the current value of `a[a[i] - 1]` is set to `i + 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables.***
