The code `z = 1` simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `z`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t \geq 2\), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `z` is `1`, and `i` is `1**.
