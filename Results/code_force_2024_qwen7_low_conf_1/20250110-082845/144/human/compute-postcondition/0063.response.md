Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5000 \) and \( t > 0 \), `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of \( n \) distinct integers where \( 1 \leq p_i \leq n \) and \( p_i \neq i \), `z` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether there exists an index `j` such that `a[a[j] - 1] == j + 1`, `i` is \( i + 1 \), `a` is updated with integers entered by the user.***
