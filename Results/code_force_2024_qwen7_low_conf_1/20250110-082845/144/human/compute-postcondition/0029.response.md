Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t \geq 2\), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `a[a[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`**
