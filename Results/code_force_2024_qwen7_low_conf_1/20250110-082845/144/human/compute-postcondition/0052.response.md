Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t > 0\), `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and \(p_i \neq i\), there exists at least one `i` such that `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`, `z` is 0, and `i` is the index where the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is met, `a` is updated with integers entered by the user, and the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is satisfied**
