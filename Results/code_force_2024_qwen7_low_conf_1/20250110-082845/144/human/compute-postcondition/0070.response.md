Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user for each iteration of the outer loop, `z` is 1 if there exists an index `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` during any of the `t` iterations, otherwise `z` is 0, `i` is the last index `i` where `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` was met (or `n - 1` if no such index exists), and the printed value is `2` if `z` is 1, and `3` if `z` is 0.**
