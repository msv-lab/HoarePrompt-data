Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here’s why:

1. **Problem Requirement**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the current implementation does not properly calculate this minimum number of invitations.

2. **Current Implementation**: The program checks if there exists any pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., if `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`). If such a pair exists, it prints `2`, otherwise it prints `3`. This logic is overly simplistic and does not cover all scenarios where at least 2 friends need to be invited.

3. **Examples to Illustrate**:
   - **Example 1**: Given `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`.
     - If Monocarp sends invitations to friends `[2, 4, 5]`, the friends `[2, 4, 5]` will come. This requires 3 invitations, not 2.
   - **Example 2**: Given `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`.
     - If Monocarp sends invitations to friends `[1, 2, 3]`, the friends `[1, 2]` will come. This requires 3 invitations, not 2.
   - **Example 3**: Given `p = [2, 1]`.
     - If Monocarp sends invitations to both friends `[1, 2]`, both will come. This requires 2 invitations, which is correct, but the current program would also print `2` for configurations where more than 2 friends need to be invited.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify cycles in the friendship graph.
   - For each cycle, at least one friend from each cycle needs to be invited to ensure all friends in the cycle attend.
   - For cycles of size 1 (which cannot exist in this problem since `p_i ≠ i`), consider each as a single friend needing an invitation.
   - The total number of unique cycles and individual friends that need to be invited will give the minimum number of invitations required.

To summarize, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
