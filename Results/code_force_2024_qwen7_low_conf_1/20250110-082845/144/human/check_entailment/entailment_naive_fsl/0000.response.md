Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where there are self-cycles in the best friend relationships. For example, if the input is `2 1`, which means friend 1's best friend is friend 2, and friend 2's best friend is friend 1, the program incorrectly prints 3 instead of 2. In this case, Monocarp can invite both friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party. However, the program checks only if `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` for a single iteration, which is insufficient to cover all possible self-cycles.
