You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair exists, only 2 invitations need to be sent. Otherwise, 3 invitations need to be sent.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of friends `n`.
   - It reads the array `a`, which represents the best friends for each friend.
   - It initializes a counter `z` to check if any friend is the best friend of their best friend.
   - For each friend `i`, it checks if `a[a[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`. This would mean that friend `i` and friend `a[i]` are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it sets `z` to 1 and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed.
   - If a pair is found, it prints 2.

However, the logic to find the minimum number of invitations needed is flawed. The program only checks for the existence of a self-loop (i.e., a pair of friends who are each other's best friends) and does not account for other possible configurations where sending fewer than 3 invitations might still invite at least 2 friends.

For example, consider the test case `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. The program will output 3 because it cannot find any self-loop, but the optimal solution is to invite friends 1 and 4, which would also invite friends 2 and 3.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.
