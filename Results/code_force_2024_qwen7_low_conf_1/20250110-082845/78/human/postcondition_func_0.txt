The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\), along with \(k\) pairs of integers \((r_i, c_i)\) representing the coordinates of fountains. It calculates a sum \(s\) based on certain conditions involving the fountain coordinates and then prints this sum along with a list of binary values indicating whether certain conditions are met for each fountain coordinate. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the total sum \(s\) plus an additional term related to the last fountain row and the column width \(m\), followed by the binary list.
