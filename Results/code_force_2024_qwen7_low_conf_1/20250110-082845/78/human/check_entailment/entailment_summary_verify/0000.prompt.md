You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an easy version of the problem; it differs from the hard version only
by the question. The easy version only needs you to print whether some values
are non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.

Alice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size n
\times m (2 \le n, m \le 10^9 ), the rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to
bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell
at the intersection of row r and column c is denoted as (r, c ).

Bob has k (2 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) fountains, all of them are located in
different cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but
she must meet several conditions:

  * To divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field. 
  * Alice's path will divide the field into two parts — one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part — to Bob. 
  * Alice will own the part that includes the cell (n, 1 ). 
  * Bob will own the part that includes the cell (1, m ). 

Alice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as
possible.

Bob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them
to Alice. First, output the integer \alpha — the maximum possible size of
Alice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will
remain on Bob's plot). Then output k non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots,
a_k , where:

  * a_i=0 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase (i.e., remains equal to \alpha ); 
  * a_i=1 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases (i.e., becomes greater than \alpha ). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n, m \le 10^9 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the field sizes and the number of
fountains, respectively.

Then follow k lines, each containing two numbers r_i and c_i (1 \le r_i \le n
, 1 \le c_i \le m ) — the coordinates of the cell with the i -th fountain. It
is guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is (n, 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, first output \alpha — the maximum size of the plot that
can belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output
k non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , where:

  * a_i=0 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase compared to the case when all k fountains belong to Bob; 
  * a_i=1 , if after Bob gives Alice the i -th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases compared to the case when all k fountains belong to Bob. 

If you output any other positive number instead of 1 that fits into a 64-bit
signed integer type, it will also be recognized as 1 . Thus, a solution to the
hard version of this problem will also pass the tests for the easy version.

The indices of the fountains are labeled in green. The cells belonging to
Alice are marked in blue.

Note that if Bob gives Alice fountain 1 or fountain 3 , then that fountain
cannot be on Alice's plot.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for z in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        c = []
        for i in range(k):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            c.append((y, x, i))
        c.sort()

                s += (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])
                f.append((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2]))
        answer[f[-1][2]] = 1

            if f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]:
                answer[f[i][2]] = 1
        print(s + (n - f[-1][1]) * m)
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\), along with \(k\) pairs of integers \((r_i, c_i)\) representing the coordinates of fountains. It calculates a sum \(s\) based on certain conditions involving the fountain coordinates and then prints this sum along with a list of binary values indicating whether certain conditions are met for each fountain coordinate. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the total sum \(s\) plus an additional term related to the last fountain row and the column width \(m\), followed by the binary list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the condition that Alice's path must include the cell (n, 1) and Bob's path must include the cell (1, m). Additionally, the program does not properly handle the scenario where Bob can give one fountain to Alice to maximize her plot size.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:
Consider a test case with \( n = 2 \), \( m = 2 \), and \( k = 3 \):
- Fountains at positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2).

The program will incorrectly calculate the maximum plot size for Alice and the corresponding values of \( a_i \).

A correct approach would involve calculating the maximum possible size of Alice's plot without any fountain changes, and then checking how giving each fountain to Alice affects this size. This involves more complex logic to ensure that the paths satisfy the given conditions.
