Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the requirements of the problem. The main goal is to determine if the program correctly calculates the maximum size of Alice's plot and the values of \(a_i\).

1. **Input Reading and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, \(t\).
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It also correctly reads the coordinates of the fountains.

2. **Sorting Fountains:**
   - The program sorts the fountains based on their column coordinates, which is a necessary step to process the fountains in order from left to right.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program maintains a list `f` to track the sequence of points that form the boundary of Alice's plot. Initially, it starts with the point (1, 0).
   - For each fountain, if its column coordinate is greater than the current rightmost column of the boundary (`f[-1][1]`), the program updates the boundary and calculates the area contributed by this fountain to Alice's plot.
   - The variable `s` accumulates the total area contributed by the fountains to Alice's plot.

4. **Determining the Maximum Plot Size:**
   - After processing all fountains, the program calculates the total area of Alice's plot by adding the remaining unprocessed area to the already calculated area `s`.
   - It then sets the value of `a_i` based on whether giving the \(i\)-th fountain to Alice would increase the maximum plot size.

However, there are several issues with the program:
- The sorting of fountains based on column coordinates alone is insufficient. Alice's path must start from the left or top side and end on the right or bottom side, ensuring she owns the cell (n, 1) and Bob owns the cell (1, m).
- The program does not consider the constraints that Alice's path must end at (n, 1) and Bob's path must end at (1, m).
- The logic for updating the boundary `f` and calculating the area contributions does not fully capture the constraints of the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- \( n = 2 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
- Fountains at (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2)

The program would incorrectly calculate the area and the values of \(a_i\) because it does not enforce the correct path constraints.

Given these issues, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Final: **False**
