Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the condition that Alice's path must include the cell (n, 1) and Bob's path must include the cell (1, m). Additionally, the program does not properly handle the scenario where Bob can give one fountain to Alice to maximize her plot size.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:
Consider a test case with \( n = 2 \), \( m = 2 \), and \( k = 3 \):
- Fountains at positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2).

The program will incorrectly calculate the maximum plot size for Alice and the corresponding values of \( a_i \).

A correct approach would involve calculating the maximum possible size of Alice's plot without any fountain changes, and then checking how giving each fountain to Alice affects this size. This involves more complex logic to ensure that the paths satisfy the given conditions.
