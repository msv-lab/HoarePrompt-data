The code `f.append((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2]))` appends a new tuple to the list `f`. Given the initial state:

- `k` must be greater than 0
- `c` is a list of lists
- `f` is a list of lists with one additional element `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`
- `s` is increased by `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`

After executing the code, the list `f` will have one more element appended to it, which is `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`. The value of `s` remains unchanged because the code does not reassign its value.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `c` is a list of lists, `f` is a list of lists with one additional element `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`, and `s` is increased by `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`**
