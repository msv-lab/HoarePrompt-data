The code `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in place. Each element in `c` is a tuple of the form `(y, x, i)`. Since `c` contains `k` tuples, sorting these tuples will reorder them based on the first element (`y`) of each tuple, unless specified otherwise (like reverse order). However, since no order is specified, it will sort in ascending order by default.

The initial state provides that `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, i)`, where `i` is set to `k-1`. After sorting, the order of the tuples in `c` will change, but the structure of each tuple remains the same. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, i)` sorted in ascending order by the first element `y`, `i` is `k-1`, `x` is the `k`-th input integer, `y` is the `k`-th second input integer.**
