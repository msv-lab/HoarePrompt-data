Postcondition: **`k` must be greater than 0, `c` is a list of lists, `f` is a list of lists with one additional element `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`, `s` is increased by `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` if `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, otherwise the state of `s` remains unchanged, and `i` is increased by 1.**
