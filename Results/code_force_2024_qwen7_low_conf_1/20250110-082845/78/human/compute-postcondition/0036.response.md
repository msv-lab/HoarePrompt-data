Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of lists where each sublist has at least one element, `i` is an index within the range of the list `f`. If `f[i][0]` is less than `f[i + 1][0]`, then `answer[f[i][2]]` is set to 1. There is no change in the state if the condition `f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]` is not met.***
