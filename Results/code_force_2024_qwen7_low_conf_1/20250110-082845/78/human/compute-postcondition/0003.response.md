The code initializes an empty list `c`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer; `c` is an empty list**
