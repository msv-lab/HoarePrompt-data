`x` and `y` are assigned the values obtained from `map(int, input().split())`. This means that two integers will be taken as input and assigned to `x` and `y` respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is an empty list, `answer` is a list of \(k\) zeros, `f` is a list of lists where each sublist has at least one element, `z` is equal to \(t\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `i` must be in the range \([0, k-1]\), and `k` must be at least 1; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer.**
