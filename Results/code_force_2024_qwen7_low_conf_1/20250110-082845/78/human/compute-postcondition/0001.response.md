According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0 and within the specified range (1 <= t <= 10^4).

Given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input value satisfies these conditions.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and t must be greater than 0**
