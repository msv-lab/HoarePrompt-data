Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, i)` sorted in ascending order by the first element `y`, `i` is now 1, `x` is the `k`-th input integer, `y` is the `k`-th second input integer, `f` is a list containing a single tuple `(1, 0, 0)`, `s` is `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, and the current value of `i` is 1, the first element of the tuple at index `i` in list `c` is greater than the first element of the tuple at the last index in list `f`.**
