The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. Before this, `x` is set to the second input integer and `y` is set to the third input integer. After executing this line, `x` and `y` will now hold the values of the first and second input integers, respectively, while the initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing the tuple `(y, x, 0)`, `i` is 1, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer**
