`x` and `y` are assigned the values of the input integers split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`c` is ['(y, x, k)'], `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `f` is a list of lists where each sublist has at least one element, `z` is equal to `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
