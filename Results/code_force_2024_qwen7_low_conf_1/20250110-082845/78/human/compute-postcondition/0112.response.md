Postcondition: ***`k` must be greater than 0, `c` is a list of lists, `f` is a list of lists with one additional element `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`, and `s` is updated to \(s + (c[i][0] - 1) \times (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\) if `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`. If `c[i][1] <= f[-1][1]`, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
