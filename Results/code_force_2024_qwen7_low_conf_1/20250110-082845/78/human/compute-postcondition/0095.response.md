`x` and `y` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `k` and `len(f)` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `k` must be a positive integer; `len(f)` must be at least 1; `x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer from input.

Output State: **`k` must be a positive integer; `len(f)` must be at least 1; `x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer from input**
