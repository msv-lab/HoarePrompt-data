Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `k`.
   - `s` is updated by adding \((c[k][0] - 1) * (c[k][1] - f[-1][1])\) to its current value.
   - `f` is updated to \([...f[-1], (c[k][0], c[k][1], c[k][2])]\) if \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\). If \(c[i][1] \leq f[-1][1]\), the values of `s` and `f` remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(k)`.
   - This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirement:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `k-1`.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - `i` needs to be set to `k-1`.
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `k`, the values of `s` and `f` will not change unless the loop body modifies them.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is `k-1`.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `f` remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it based on the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\).

Given this reasoning, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `k-1`, `s` is unchanged, and `f` is unchanged unless the loop body updates it based on the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\)**.
