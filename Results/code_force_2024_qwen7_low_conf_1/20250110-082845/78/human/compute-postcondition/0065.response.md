`s` is assigned the value of itself plus \((c[i][0] - 1) \times (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\). Given the initial state, `i` is \(k-1\) and `k` is greater than 0. Also, the current value of `c[i][1]` is greater than the last element of `f` in the second position.

Let's break it down:

1. The value of `c[i][0]` is not specified, but let's denote it as \(a\).
2. The value of `c[i][1]` is denoted as \(b\), which is greater than the last element of `f` in the second position, let's denote this last element as \(d\).

So, the expression \((c[i][0] - 1) \times (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\) simplifies to \((a - 1) \times (b - d)\).

Therefore, the updated value of `s` is `s + (a - 1) * (b - d)`.

Output State: **`i` is \(k-1\), `k` is greater than 0, `c[i][1]` is greater than the last element of `f` in the second position, and `s` is `s + (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`.**
