The code `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in ascending order based on the second element of each tuple (which is `x`). The initial state of the variables is as follows:

- `k` is a non-negative integer.
- `len(f)` is at most `k` and at least 1.
- `x` is an integer from input.
- `y` is an integer from input.
- `c` is a list containing tuples `(y, x, i)` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`.
- `f` contains the tuples from `c` that satisfy the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), along with the initial tuple \((1, 0, 0)\).

After sorting `c` in ascending order based on the second element of each tuple, the values of `k`, `len(f)`, `x`, `y`, and `f` remain unchanged. However, the list `c` will now be sorted according to the second element of each tuple.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `len(f)` is at most `k` and at least 1, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `c` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each tuple, and `f` contains the tuples from `c` that satisfy the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), along with the initial tuple \((1, 0, 0)\).**
