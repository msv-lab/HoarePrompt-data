The code `f.append((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2]))` appends a tuple to the list `f`. The tuple consists of elements from the list `c[i]` at indices 0, 1, and 2.

Given the initial state:
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `c` is a list of lists
- `f` is a list of lists
- `s` is updated to \(s + (c[i][0] - 1) \times (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\)

The impact of the code on the program is that it appends a new element to the list `f`. The new element is a tuple `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`.

Since the value of `s` was updated before this line of code and we don't have the exact value of `s`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s` after appending to `f`. However, we know the structure and the new element in `f`.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `c` is a list of lists, `f` is a list of lists with one additional element `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`, and `s` is updated to \(s + (c[i][0] - 1) \times (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\).**
