According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `c` is a list containing the tuples `(y, x, 0)` and `(y, x, 1)`.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is the first input integer.
- `y` is the second input integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2, and the condition `k > i` must hold true.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing the tuples `(y, x, 0)` and `(y, x, 1)`, `i` is 2, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer**
