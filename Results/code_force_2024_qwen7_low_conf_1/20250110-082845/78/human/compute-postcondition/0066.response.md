`f.append((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2]))` appends a tuple containing the values from `c[i][0]`, `c[i][1]`, and `c[i][2]` to the list `f`. Given the initial conditions, the following variables are impacted:

- `i` remains `k-1`
- `k` remains greater than 0
- `c[i][1]` is greater than the last element of `f` in the second position
- `s` remains `s + (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`

After appending the new tuple to `f`, the length of `f` increases by one, and its last element becomes `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`.

Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is greater than 0, `c[i][1]` is greater than the last element of `f` in the second position, `s` is `s + (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`, and `f` is `[ ..., (c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])]`**
