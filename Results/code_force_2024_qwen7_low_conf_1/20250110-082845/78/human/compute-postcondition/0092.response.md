The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `s`, `f`, `answer`, `z`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is `len(f) - 1`, `s` is the sum of \((c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\) for all `i` where \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), `f` contains the tuples from `c` that satisfy the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), along with the initial tuple \((1, 0, 0)\), `answer[f[-1][2]]` is 1, `len(f)` must be at least 3, `answer[f[i][2]]` is 1 if \(f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]\) for all valid `i`, `z` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
