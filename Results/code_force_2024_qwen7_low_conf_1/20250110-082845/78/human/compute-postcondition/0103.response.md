Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `len(f)` is at most `k` and at least 1, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `c` is a list containing tuples `(y, x, i)` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, and `f` contains the tuples from `c` that satisfy the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), along with the initial tuple \((1, 0, 0)\).**
