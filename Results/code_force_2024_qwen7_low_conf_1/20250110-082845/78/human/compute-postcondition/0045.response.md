The code `print(*answer)` does not modify any variables; it only prints the contents of the `answer` list. The `answer` list remains unchanged after this line of code is executed.

Output State: **`answer` is a list of \(k\) zeros where the elements at indices corresponding to the first elements of tuples in `f` that satisfy `f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]` are set to 1; `f` is a list of lists where each sublist has at least one element.**
