The code appends a tuple `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])` to the list `f`. From the initial state, we know `i` is `k`, and `s` is updated by adding `(c[k][0] - 1) * (c[k][1] - f[-1][1])` to its current value. After appending the tuple, the value of `i` remains `k`, the value of `s` is updated according to the given formula, and the list `f` now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`i` is `k`, `s` is updated by adding `(c[k][0] - 1) * (c[k][1] - f[-1][1])` to its current value, `f` is `[...f[-1], (c[k][0], c[k][1], c[k][2])]`**
