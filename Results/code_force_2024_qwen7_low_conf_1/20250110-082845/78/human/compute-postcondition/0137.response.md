The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the function definition. Instead, it seems to process data through test cases internally, where each test case includes an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, it processes three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) with the constraints \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \times 10^5\). Additionally, it processes \(k\) pairs of integers \((r_i, c_i)\) where \(1 \leq r_i \leq n\) and \(1 \leq c_i \leq m\), representing the coordinates of fountains. The function ensures that all fountains are in different cells and none of them is at \((n, 1)\). The sum of \(k\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

Based on the given information, the function does not return a specific value but processes the input data according to the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t`, and for each test case, it processes three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) along with \(k\) pairs of integers \((r_i, c_i)\) representing the coordinates of fountains, ensuring the constraints are met.**
