Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\), along with \(k\) pairs of integers \((r_i, c_i)\) representing the coordinates of fountains. It calculates a sum \(s\) based on certain conditions involving the fountain coordinates and then prints this sum along with a list of binary values indicating whether certain conditions are met for each fountain coordinate. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the total sum \(s\) plus an additional term related to the last fountain row and the column width \(m\), followed by the binary list.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
1. Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case:
   - Reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - Collects \(k\) fountain coordinates \((r_i, c_i)\) into a list `c`.
   - Sorts the fountain coordinates by their column index \(c_i\).
   - Initializes a list `f` with the first fountain and calculates a running sum \(s\) based on the relative positions of consecutive fountains.
   - Updates a list `answer` marking certain indices based on specific conditions.
3. After processing all test cases, it prints the final sum \(s\) plus an additional term related to the last fountain row and the column width \(m\).
4. Prints the list `answer`.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If all fountains have the same column index, no sum \(s\) will be added, and the output will only depend on the initial sum \(s\).
- If the last fountain has the maximum column index, the additional term \((n - f[-1][1]) * m\) will be zero.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input is always valid and meets the specified constraints, which are implicitly checked by the problem description but not explicitly enforced within the function.
