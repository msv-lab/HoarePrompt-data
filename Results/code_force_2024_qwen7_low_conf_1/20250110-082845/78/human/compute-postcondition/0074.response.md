The code snippet `f.append((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2]))` appends a tuple containing the values of `c[i][0]`, `c[i][1]`, and `c[i][2]` to the list `f`. This operation does not affect the values of `i` or `s`, but it does update the list `f`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `k-1`
- `s` is unchanged
- `f` is unchanged unless the loop body updates it based on the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\)

After executing the code, the list `f` will have one additional element, which is the tuple \((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])\).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `k-1`, `s` is unchanged, and `f` is updated to include the new tuple \((c[k-1][0], c[k-1][1], c[k-1][2])\).**
