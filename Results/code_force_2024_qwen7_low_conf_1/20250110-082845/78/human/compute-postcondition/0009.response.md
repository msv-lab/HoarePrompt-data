The code `c.append((y, x, i))` appends a tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `c` is a list containing the tuple `(y, x, 0)`.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is the first input integer.
- `y` is the second input integer.

After the code executes, the list `c` will have its original tuple plus the new tuple `(y, x, i)`. Since `i` is 1, the new tuple will be `(y, x, 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing the tuples `(y, x, 0)` and `(y, x, 1), `i` is 1, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer**
