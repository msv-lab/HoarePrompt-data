State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 and t must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for i in range(k):` means that the loop will iterate from `0` to `k-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start at `0` and `k` must be a positive integer greater than `0`.
3. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are inputs, but the loop's execution depends directly on `i` starting from `0` and `k` being greater than `0`.

Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is `0` and `k` is greater than `0`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `c`) do not directly affect the loop's execution.
