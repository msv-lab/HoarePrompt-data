The code `c.append((y, x, i))` appends a tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. The variables `k`, `len(f)`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this line of code. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains as an unspecified integer value.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer; `len(f)` is at least 1; `x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer from input; `c` is a list containing at least one tuple `(y, x, i)`**
