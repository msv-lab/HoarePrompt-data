The code `c.append((y, x, i))` appends a tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 2, `x` is the new first input integer, and `y` is the new second input integer. The tuple `(y, x, 2)` will be appended to the list `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing the tuples `(y, x, 0)`, `(y, x, 1)`, and `(y, x, 2)`, `i` is 2, `x` is the new first input integer, `y` is the new second input integer**
