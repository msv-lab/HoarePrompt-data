Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, i)` sorted in ascending order by the first element `y`, `f` is a list containing two tuples `[(1, 0, 0), (c[3][0], c[3][1], c[3][2])]`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the `k`-th input integer, `y` is the `k`-th second input integer, `s` is updated to \((c[3][0] - 1) * (c[3][1] - f[-1][1])\) if \(c[3][1] > f[-1][1]\) otherwise `s` remains unchanged, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros**
