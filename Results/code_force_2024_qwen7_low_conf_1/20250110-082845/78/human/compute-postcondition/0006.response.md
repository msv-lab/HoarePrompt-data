`c` is appended with a tuple containing `(y, x, i)`. Here, `y` is the second input integer, `x` is the first input integer, and `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 and t must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing the tuple `(y, x, 0)`, `i` is 0, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 and t must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing the tuple `(y, x, 0)`, `i` is 0, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer**
