Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of theform `(y, x, i)` sorted in ascending order by the first element `y`, `f` is a list containing two tuples: `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[1][0], c[1][1], c[1][2])`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the `k`-th input integer, `y` is the `k`-th second input integer, `f` is a list containing a single tuple `(1, 0, 0)`, `s` is `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros. If `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, then `f` is updated to contain two tuples `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[1][0], c[1][1], c[1][2])`, and `s` is updated to `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
