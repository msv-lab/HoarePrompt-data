Postcondition: ***`i` is `k`, `s` is the sum of \((c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\) for all `i` where \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), `f` contains the tuples from `c` that satisfy the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\), along with the initial tuple \((1, 0, 0)\), and `answer[f[-1][2]]` is 1; `len(f)` must be at least 3, and `k` must be in the range `[1, len(f) - 2]`; if \((f[i][0], f[i + 1][0])\) satisfies the condition \(f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]\), then no change is made to the state; otherwise, no change is made to the state.***
