`c` is appended with a tuple `(y, x, i)`. The values of `y`, `x`, and `i` are taken from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is an empty list plus the tuple `(y, x, i)`, `answer` is a list of \(k\) zeros, `f` is a list of lists where each sublist has at least one element, `z` is equal to \(t\), `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `i` must be in the range \([0, k-1]\), and `k` must be at least 1; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer.**
