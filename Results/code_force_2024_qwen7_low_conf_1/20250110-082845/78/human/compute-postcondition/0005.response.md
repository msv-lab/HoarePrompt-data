The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are not known, so they are assigned the values obtained from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 and t must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer**
