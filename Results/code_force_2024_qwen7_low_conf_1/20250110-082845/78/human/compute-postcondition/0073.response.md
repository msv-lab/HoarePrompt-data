The code snippet updates the value of `s` based on the condition and the values of `c[i][0]`, `c[i][1]`, and `f[-1][1]`. Let's break down the impact:

1. The value of `i` is known to be `k-1`.
2. `s` is incremented by `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`.

Since the exact values of `c[i][0]`, `c[i][1]`, and `f[-1][1]` are not specified, we will use the general form to express the updated value of `s`.

The initial state is:
- `i` is `k-1`
- `s` is unchanged
- `f` is unchanged unless the loop body updates it based on the condition \(c[i][1] > f[-1][1]\)

After executing the code, the value of `s` will be updated as follows:
\[ s = s + (c[i][0] - 1) \times (c[i][1] - f[-1][1]) \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `k-1`, `s` is updated to `s + (c[k-1][0] - 1) * (c[k-1][1] - f[-1][1])`, and `f` is unchanged unless the loop body updates it based on the condition \(c[k-1][1] > f[-1][1]\).**
