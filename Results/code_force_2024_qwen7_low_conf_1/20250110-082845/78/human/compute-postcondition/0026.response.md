Postcondition: ***`i` is 2; `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, i)` sorted in ascending order by the first element `y`; `f` is a list containing a single tuple `[(1, 0, 0)]`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the `k`-th input integer; `y` is the `k`-th second input integer; if `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, then `s` is updated to `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged; `answer` is a list of `k` zeros.***
