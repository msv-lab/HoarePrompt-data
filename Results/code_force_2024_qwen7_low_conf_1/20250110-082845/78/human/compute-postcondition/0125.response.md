`answer[f[i][2]]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `f[i][0]` is less than `f[i + 1][0]`, and the length of `f` is at least 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(f)` is at least 3, `answer[f[i][2]]` is 1, the current value of `f[i][0]` is less than `f[i + 1][0]`**
