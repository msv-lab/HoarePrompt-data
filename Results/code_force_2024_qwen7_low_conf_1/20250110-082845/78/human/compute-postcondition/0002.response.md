The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them based on whitespace, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and `t` must be greater than 0, this precondition remains unaffected and valid post-execution.

However, the values of `t` are not used in the current code snippet, so they remain unchanged. The new variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values read from the input, which are integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
