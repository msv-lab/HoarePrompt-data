`s` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `s` is now `0`, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `c` is still sorted in ascending order by the first element `y`, and the list `f` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t\) must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, i)` sorted in ascending order by the first element `y`, `i` is `k-1`, `x` is the `k`-th input integer, `y` is the `k`-th second input integer, `f` is a list containing a single tuple `(1, 0, 0)`, `s` is 0.**
