t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. The coordinates of each fountain (r_i, c_i) are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ m, and all fountains have distinct positions. Additionally, none of the fountain positions is (n, 1).
