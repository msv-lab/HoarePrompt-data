You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The only difference with the medium version is the maximum length of the
input.

A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

Surprisingly, it turns out that the balanced shuffle of any balanced
parentheses sequence is always another balanced parentheses sequence (we will
omit the proof for brevity). Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of
two different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore
the balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced
parentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Find its preimage: the balanced
parentheses sequence the balanced shuffle of which is equal to the given
sequence.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the balanced parentheses sequence t such that the balanced shuffle of t
is equal to s . It is guaranteed that the answer always exists and is unique.

Example

Input

    ()(()())
    
Output

    (()(()))

# Annotated Program:
s = input()
q = [[]]
it = iter(q)
cur = next(it)
for c in s:
    if c == '(':
        x = []
        cur.append(x)
        q.append(x)
    if c == ')':
        cur = next(it)
print(func_1(q[0]))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: u is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and u is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(u):
    q = [(0, v) for v in u]
    s = []
    while q:
        pc, u = q.pop()
        
        if pc == 0:
            s.append('(')
            q.append((1, u))
            q.extend((0, v) for v in u)
        
        if pc == 1:
            s.append(')')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `q` is empty, `s` contains the fully constructed balanced parentheses sequence corresponding to `u`
    return ''.join(s)
    #The program returns an empty string since `s` is an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `u`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". It checks whether `u` is a valid balanced parentheses sequence. If `u` is a valid balanced sequence, the function constructs a new balanced parentheses sequence where every opening parenthesis "(" in `u` is replaced by a matching closing parenthesis ")". The function then returns an empty string. If `u` is not a valid balanced sequence, the function will still attempt to construct a new sequence but will fail to do so properly, leading to an incorrect output. The function handles the case where `u` is an empty string or a string with an odd number of parentheses, resulting in an invalid sequence.
