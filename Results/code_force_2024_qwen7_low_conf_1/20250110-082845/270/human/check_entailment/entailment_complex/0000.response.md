Reasoning:
The annotated program does not accurately implement the logic required to find the preimage of the balanced shuffle operation. The `func_1` function attempts to construct a new balanced parentheses sequence by converting all opening parentheses to closing ones, which is not the correct approach for finding the preimage. 

To find the preimage, one needs to reverse the balanced shuffle operation. The given code does not correctly reverse the operation. Instead, it seems to try to convert all opening parentheses to closing ones, which would not produce the original sequence before the shuffle operation was applied.

Given the problem statement and the need to find the preimage of the balanced shuffle operation, the provided function `func_1` does not meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**
