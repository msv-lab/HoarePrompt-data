You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The only difference with the medium version is the maximum length of the
input.

A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

Surprisingly, it turns out that the balanced shuffle of any balanced
parentheses sequence is always another balanced parentheses sequence (we will
omit the proof for brevity). Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of
two different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore
the balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced
parentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Find its preimage: the balanced
parentheses sequence the balanced shuffle of which is equal to the given
sequence.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the balanced parentheses sequence t such that the balanced shuffle of t
is equal to s . It is guaranteed that the answer always exists and is unique.

Example

Input

    ()(()())
    
Output

    (()(()))

- Program:
s = input()
q = [[]]
it = iter(q)
cur = next(it)
for c in s:
    if c == '(':
        x = []
        cur.append(x)
        q.append(x)
    if c == ')':
        cur = next(it)
print(func_1(q[0]))

def func_1(u):
    q = [(0, v) for v in u]
    s = []
    while q:
        (pc, u) = q.pop()
        if pc == 0:
            s.append('(')
            q.append((1, u))
            q.extend(((0, v) for v in u))
        if pc == 1:
            s.append(')')
    return ''.join(s)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `u`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". It checks whether `u` is a valid balanced parentheses sequence. If `u` is a valid balanced sequence, the function constructs a new balanced parentheses sequence where every opening parenthesis "(" in `u` is replaced by a matching closing parenthesis ")". The function then returns an empty string. If `u` is not a valid balanced sequence, the function will still attempt to construct a new sequence but will fail to do so properly, leading to an incorrect output. The function handles the case where `u` is an empty string or a string with an odd number of parentheses, resulting in an invalid sequence.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Program Structure**: The given program attempts to implement the balanced shuffle operation to find the preimage of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
2. **Balanced Shuffle Operation Implementation**:
   - The program constructs a nested list structure (`q`) representing the balance of the prefix at each position of the input string `s`.
   - It iterates through the characters of `s`, updating the nested list `q` to reflect the balance changes.
   - After constructing the nested list `q`, it uses the `func_1` function to reconstruct the original balanced parentheses sequence from which the given sequence could have been derived through the balanced shuffle operation.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the initial list `u` (which represents the final state of `q` after processing the input string `s`) and reconstructs the original balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It does this by traversing the nested lists in the order of their balance values, appending opening and closing parentheses accordingly.
4. **Validation**:
   - The nested list construction step correctly reflects the balance of the input sequence.
   - The `func_1` function correctly reconstructs the preimage by respecting the order of balances and positions as defined by the balanced shuffle operation.
   - Given the constraints and the properties of the balanced shuffle operation (bijection on balanced sequences), the solution should work for all valid inputs as described.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to find the preimage of a given balanced parentheses sequence through the balanced shuffle operation.
