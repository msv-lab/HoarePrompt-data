Postcondition: ***`pc` is 1, `u` is a list where the last element is removed, `q` is a list containing `p` and two tuples (0, a) and (0, b) where `a` and `b` are the last elements of the original `u`, `s` is `[')', ')']***

Explanation: Since the if part is executed when `pc == 1`, the postcondition directly follows the if part's description. There is no else part in the code, so the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the condition evaluation.
