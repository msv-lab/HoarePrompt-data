The code `q.extend((0, v) for v in u)` extends the list `q` by adding tuples `(0, v)` for each element `v` in the tuple `u`. 

- The initial state of `q` is `[(0, a), (0, b), (1, u)]`.
- The initial state of `u` is `(0, a)`.

For each element `v` in `u`, which is `(0, a)`, the code creates a tuple `(0, a)` and appends it to `q`. Since `u` only contains one element, `(0, a)`, the code adds `(0, a)` to `q` once.

Therefore, the updated list `q` becomes `[(0, a), (0, b), (1, u), (0, a)]`.

Output State: **`pc` is 1, `u` is (0, a), `q` is [(0, a), (0, b), (1, u), (0, a)], `s` is ['(']**
