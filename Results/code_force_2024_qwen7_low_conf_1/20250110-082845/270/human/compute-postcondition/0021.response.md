The code `pc, u = q.pop()` pops the last element from the list `q` and assigns it to `pc` and `u`. The initial state of `q` is `[(0, a), (0, b), (1, u), (0, a)]`.

After popping the last element, `q` becomes `[(0, a), (0, b), (1, u)]` and `pc` and `u` are set to the last element of `q`, which is `(0, a)`. Therefore, `pc` is now `0` and `u` is now `(0, a)`.

Output State: **`pc` is 0, `u` is (0, a), `q` is [(0, a), (0, b), (1, u)]**
