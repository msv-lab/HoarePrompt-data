The code `pc, u = q.pop()` impacts the following variables:
- `q` is a list of tuples, each tuple being `(0, v)` for each character `v` in `u`.
- `u` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `q.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `q`, which is a tuple `(0, v)` where `v` is the last character in `u`.

After the operation:
- `pc` is assigned the first element of the tuple, which is `0`.
- `u` is assigned the second element of the tuple, which is the last character `v` in the string `u`.

The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Since `q` is a list of tuples `(0, v)` for each character `v` in `u`, popping the last tuple will remove the last character `v` from `u`. Let's denote the last character of `u` as `last_char`. After popping, `u` will be `u[:-1]` (all characters except the last one).

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `pc` is `0`.
- `u` is now the string `u[:-1]`.
- `q` is the list of tuples `q[:-1]`.

Output State: **`pc` is 0; `u` is `u[:-1]`; `q` is `q[:-1]`**
