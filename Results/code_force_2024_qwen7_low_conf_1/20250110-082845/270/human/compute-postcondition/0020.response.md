To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables at the end of the previous iteration.

Given:
- The `while` loop condition: `while q:`
- Variables and their values at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `pc` is 1
  - `u` is (0, a)
  - `q` is [(0, a), (0, b), (1, u), (0, a)]
  - `s` is ['(', ')']

The loop will continue to execute as long as the list `q` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the list `q` must still contain elements.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` contains the elements [(0, a), (0, b), (1, u), (0, a)]

Since `q` is not empty, the loop can execute again. No changes are required to the state of the variables for the loop to continue executing. 

Therefore, the state remains the same as given in the problem statement.

State: **`pc` is 1, `u` is (0, a), `q` is [(0, a), (0, b), (1, u), (0, a)], `s` is ['(', ')']**
