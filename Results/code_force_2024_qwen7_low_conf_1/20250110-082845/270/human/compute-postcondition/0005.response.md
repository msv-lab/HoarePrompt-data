`s` is a list to which the character '(' is appended. The value of `pc` remains unchanged as it was initially 0, and the values of `u` and `q` also remain unchanged as they were both assigned to their respective slices before. Therefore, the Output State is: `pc` is 0, `u` is `u[:-1]`, `q` is `q[:-1]`, and `s` is a list containing '('.

Output State: **`pc` is 0, `u` is `u[:-1]`, `q` is `q[:-1]`, `s` is ['(']**
