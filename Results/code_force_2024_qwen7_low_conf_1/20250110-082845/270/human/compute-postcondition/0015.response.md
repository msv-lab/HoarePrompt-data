The code appends a new tuple `(1, u)` to the list `q`. The initial state is given as follows:
- `pc` is 1
- `u` is `(0, a)`
- `q` is `[ (0, a), (0, b) ]`
- `s` is `['(']`

After executing `q.append((1, u))`, the list `q` will have the new tuple appended to it. So, `q` will become `[ (0, a), (0, b), (1, u) ]`.

The other variables (`pc`, `u`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pc` is 1, `u` is (0, a), `q` is [(0, a), (0, b), (1, u)], `s` is ['(']**
