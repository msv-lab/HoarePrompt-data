`q` appends a tuple `(1, u)` to its end. The value of `u` is `u[:-1]`, which means it is the string `u` without its last character. The value of `q` is `q[:-1]`, which means it is the list `q` without its last element. After appending the tuple `(1, u)` to `q`, the new value of `q` will be the list without its last element plus the tuple `(1, u)`. The value of `s` remains unchanged, and `pc` is not affected.

Output State: **`pc` is 0, `u` is `u[:-1]`, `q` is `q[:-1] + [(1, u)]`, `s` is ['(']**
