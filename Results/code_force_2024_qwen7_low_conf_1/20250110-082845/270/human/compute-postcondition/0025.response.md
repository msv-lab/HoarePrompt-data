Postcondition: ***`pc` is 0, `u` is (0, a), `q` is [(0, a), (0, b), (1, u), (1, u), (0, 0), (0, a)], `s` is ['(']*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part provided, the overall postcondition is directly derived from the if part. The if condition `pc == 0` is satisfied, and the specified changes to `u`, `q`, and `s` are applied, resulting in the given postcondition.
