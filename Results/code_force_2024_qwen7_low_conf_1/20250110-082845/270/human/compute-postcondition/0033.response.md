Functionality: **The function accepts an input string `s` which is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(", and ")". It computes the prefix sum array `prefix_sum` where `prefix_sum[i]` represents the net balance of parentheses up to index `i-1`. Then, it sorts the pairs of `(prefix_sum[i], i)` and reconstructs the balanced parentheses sequence by iterating over these sorted pairs. If the current prefix sum is greater than the previous one, it appends the necessary number of opening parentheses to ensure the correct balance. It then appends the substring from the previous position to the current position in the sorted pairs. Finally, it prints the fully reconstructed balanced parentheses sequence. This function ensures that the output sequence is balanced and matches the original input sequence. Potential edge cases include an empty input string (though the problem statement specifies the string is non-empty), and the function handles these cases by ensuring the input is a valid balanced sequence.**
