The code `q.append((1, u))` appends the tuple `(1, u)` to the list `q`. Given the initial state where `q` is `[(0, a), (0, b), (1, u)]`, after appending `(1, u)`, the list `q` will become `[(0, a), (0, b), (1, u), (1, u)]`.

The states of the other variables (`pc`, `u`, and `s`) are not affected.

Output State: **`pc` is 0, `u` is (0, a), `q` is [(0, a), (0, b), (1, u), (1, u)], `s` is ['(']**
