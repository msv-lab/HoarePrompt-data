`pc` and `u` are updated by the `pop()` method on the list `q`. The list `q` originally contains `[pc, u, (0, a), (0, b)]` where `pc` is 1, `u` is a list with its last element removed, and `(0, a)` and `(0, b)` are tuples with `a` and `b` being the last elements of the original `u`. After `q.pop()`, `pc` becomes the first element of `q`, which is 1, and `u` becomes the second element of `q`, which is the tuple `(0, a)`. Therefore, `u` now is `(0, a)`.

Output State: **`pc` is 1, `u` is (0, a), `q` is [(0, a), (0, b)]**
