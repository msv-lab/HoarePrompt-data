Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `u`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". It checks whether `u` is a valid balanced parentheses sequence. If `u` is a valid balanced sequence, the function constructs a new balanced parentheses sequence where every opening parenthesis "(" in `u` is replaced by a matching closing parenthesis ")". The function then returns an empty string. If `u` is not a valid balanced sequence, the function will still attempt to construct a new sequence but will fail to do so properly, leading to an incorrect output. The function handles the case where `u` is an empty string or a string with an odd number of parentheses, resulting in an invalid sequence.**
