Postcondition: **The loop cannot execute one more time given the constraints on `N`. If `i` is less than `N - 1` and `slices[i]` is less than `slices[i + 1]`, then `bob_sum` is increased by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1. Otherwise, `alice_sum` is increased by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 0.**
