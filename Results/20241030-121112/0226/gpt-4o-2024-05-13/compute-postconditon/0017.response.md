Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50 and is reassigned the value of `int(data[0])`, `slices` is a list of integers converted from the remaining elements of `data`, `data` is a list of input strings, `alice_sum` is 0, `i` is assigned the value of `N`. If `i < N - 1` and `slices[i] < slices[i + 1]`, then `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1. Otherwise, `alice_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]`, `bob_sum` remains unchanged, and `decider` is set to 0.**
