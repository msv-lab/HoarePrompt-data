Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50 and is reassigned the value of `int(data[0])`, `slices` is a list of integers converted from the remaining elements of `data`, `data` is a list of input strings, `alice_sum` is 0, `bob_sum` is 0, `i` is assigned the value of `N`, `decider` is 0. If `decider` is 0 and `i` is less than `N - 1` and `slices[i]` is less than `slices[i + 1]`, then `alice_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `decider` is 0 and one of the conditions (`i` is not less than `N - 1` or `slices[i]` is not less than `slices[i + 1]`) is not met, then `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1. If `decider` is 1 and `i` is less than `N - 1` and `slices[i]` is less than `slices[i + 1]`, then `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `decider` is 1 and one of the conditions (`i` is not less than `N - 1` or `slices[i]` is not less than `slices[i + 1]`) is not met, then `alice_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 0.**
