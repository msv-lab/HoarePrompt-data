`decider` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `alice_sum` is increased by `slices[i]` where `i` is less than -1, `decider` is 0.

Output State: **variable `alice_sum` is increased by `slices[i]` where `i` is less than -1, `decider` is 0**
