`bob_sum` is incremented by the value of `slices[i]`, but the previous values of `bob_sum` and `slices[i]` are unknown, so the output state is: `bob_sum` is increased by `slices[i]`. The loop cannot execute one more time given the constraints on `N`.

Output State: **`bob_sum` is increased by `slices[i]`. The loop cannot execute one more time given the constraints on `N`.**
