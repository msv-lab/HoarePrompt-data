`sizes` is assigned the value `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input` accepts a space-separated string of integers, `split()` divides this string into a list of strings, `map(int, ...)` converts each string to an integer, and `list(...)` creates a list from these integers. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **N is an input integer between 1 and 50, and sizes is a list of integers obtained from the input, where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive**
