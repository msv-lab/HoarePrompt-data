Postcondition: **`N` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `sizes` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive. If `decider` is True, `alice` is increased by `size`, `bob` remains 0. If `decider` is False, `bob` is increased by `size`, `alice` remains 0. `decider` is initialized to True, `iterator` is an iterator over `sizes` and has more elements to iterate, `size` is the next element from `iterator`.**
