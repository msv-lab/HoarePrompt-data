`bob` is incremented by `size`, where `size` is the next element from `iterator`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `sizes` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive, `alice` is 0, `bob` is 0 + `size`, `decider` is True, `iterator` is an iterator over `sizes` and has more elements to iterate, `size` is the next element from `iterator`**
