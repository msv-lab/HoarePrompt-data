The `StopIteration` exception is raised when the `next()` function is called on an iterator that has no more items. This exception would occur at the line `size = next(iterator)`. If the exception is raised, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the statements within the `try` block.

### Summarizing the Program State

#### After the `try` block execution:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `N` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
   - `sizes` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive.
   - `alice` and `bob` are integers initialized to 0.
   - `decider` is a boolean initialized to True.
   - `iterator` is an iterator over `sizes` and has more elements to iterate.
   - `size` is the next element from `iterator`.

2. **Changes in State**:
   - `size` is assigned the next element from `iterator`.
   - If `decider` is True, `alice` is increased by `size`.
   - If `decider` is False, `bob` is increased by `size`.
   - `decider` is toggled to its opposite value (True to False or False to True).

#### After the `except` block execution:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - Variables can hold any values.

2. **Changes in State**:
   - The `StopIteration` exception causes the loop or statement block to break out, making the state unknown after this point.

### Final Output State
Considering the above details, here's the combined program state after the complete execution of the `try` statement:

Output State: **`N` is an input integer between 1 and 50. `sizes` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive. `alice` is increased by `size` if `decider` is True, `bob` is increased by `size` if `decider` is False, `iterator` is an iterator over `sizes`. If `iterator` has more elements, `size` is the next element from `iterator`, and `decider` is toggled to its opposite value. If `iterator` has no more elements, the program breaks out of the loop or statement block, and the state becomes unknown.**
