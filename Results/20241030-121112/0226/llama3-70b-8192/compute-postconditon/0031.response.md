Output State: **`N` remains an input integer between 1 and 50. `sizes` remains a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive. `alice` and `bob` contain sums of elements from `sizes` based on the alternating value of `decider`. `decider` is toggled to its opposite value each iteration and ends in the opposite state from which it started. `iterator` is exhausted. If `sizes` is empty, `alice` and `bob` remain 0. The values of `alice` and `bob` are printed.**
