Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few critical issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here is a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. This is suitable for competitive programming environments but may not be ideal for all contexts. Although this isn't a correctness issue per se, it can cause problems if the input format isn't strictly followed.

2. **Angle Calculation and Sorting**: The program calculates the angle of each vector using `math.atan2(y, x)` and stores these angles along with the vector indices. The vectors are then sorted based on these angles. This part is correct and necessary for finding the minimal non-oriented angle.

3. **Angle Difference Calculation**: The program calculates the differences between consecutive angles in the sorted list to find the minimal angle difference. This is also correct in principle.

4. **Circular Case Handling**: The program handles the circular case by considering the angle difference between the first and last vectors in the sorted list. This is critical and handled correctly in the code.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: There are edge cases that the program does not handle correctly. For example, consider two vectors that have very small differences in their angles but are close to the boundary between `-π` and `π`. The angle difference calculation might not account for this properly.

### Edge Case Example:

Input:
```
3
1 0
-1 1
-1 -1
```

Expected Output: The minimal angle should be between vectors `2` and `3` because their angle difference is very small. However, the program might not correctly identify this due to the angle wrap-around issue.

### Edge Case Analysis:
- The angles for the vectors will be approximately:
  - Vector 1: 0 (1, 0)
  - Vector 2: 2.356 (approx) (-1, 1)
  - Vector 3: -2.356 (approx) (-1, -1)

- The smallest non-oriented angle should be between vectors 2 and 3, but due to the way the program handles the circular case, it might incorrectly identify the pair.

Therefore, the provided code can fail in cases where vectors are near the boundary between `-π` and `π`. This indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and thus, the correctness of the program is **False**.
