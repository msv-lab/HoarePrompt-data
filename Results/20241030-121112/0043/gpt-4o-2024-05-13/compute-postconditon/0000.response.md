`input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from the standard input. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; for each vector, `x` and `y` are integers such that |`x`|, |`y`| ≤ 10,000 and `x`^2 + `y`^2 > 0; `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`**
