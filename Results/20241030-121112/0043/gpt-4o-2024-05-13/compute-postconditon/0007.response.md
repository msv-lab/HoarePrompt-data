Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; for each vector, `x` and `y` are integers such that |`x`|, |`y`| ≤ 10,000 and `x`^2 + `y`^2 > 0; `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`; `vectors` is an empty list; `i` is assigned the value of `n`; `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2 * i + 1])`; `y` is assigned the value of `int(data[2 * i + 2])`; `angle` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`**
