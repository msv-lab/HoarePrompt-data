Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; for each vector, `x` and `y` are integers such that |`x`|, |`y`| ≤ 10,000 and `x`^2 + `y`^2 > 0; `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`; `vectors` is a sorted list; `i` is 2; `angle_diff` is assigned the value `vectors[i][0] - vectors[i - 1][0]`. If `angle_diff` is less than `min_angle`, then `min_angle` is updated to `angle_diff`, and `a` and `b` are updated to `vectors[i - 1][1]` and `vectors[i][1]` respectively. Otherwise, `min_angle`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
