Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; for each vector, `x` and `y` are integers such that |`x`|, |`y`| ≤ 10,000 and `x`^2 + `y`^2 > 0; `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`; `vectors` is a sorted list; `i` is `n`; `angle_diff` is assigned the value `vectors[n-1][0] - vectors[n-2][0]`; if `angle_diff` is less than `min_angle`, then `min_angle` is updated to `angle_diff`, and `a` and `b` are updated to `vectors[n-2][1]` and `vectors[n-1][1]` respectively. Otherwise, `min_angle`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `vectors` has fewer than `n` elements, an `IndexError` may occur; `first_last_angle_diff` is assigned the value `2 * math.pi - (vectors[-1][0] - vectors[0][0])`; `a` is updated to `vectors[0][1]`; `b` is updated to `vectors[-1][1]`.**
