`min_angle` is assigned the value of `angle_diff`. The previous value of `min_angle` was `float('inf')`, and the value of `angle_diff` is `vectors[i][0] - vectors[i - 1][0]`. Therefore, the new value of `min_angle` is `vectors[i][0] - vectors[i - 1][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; for each vector, `x` and `y` are integers such that |`x`|, |`y`| ≤ 10,000 and `x`^2 + `y`^2 > 0; `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`; `vectors` is a sorted list; `i` is 2; `min_angle` is assigned the value `vectors[i][0] - vectors[i - 1][0]`; `a` is -1; `b` is -1; `angle_diff` is assigned the value `vectors[i][0] - vectors[i - 1][0]`**
