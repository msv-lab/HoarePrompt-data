Output State: **The function reads `n` vectors from standard input, calculates the angles of these vectors, and prints the indices of the two vectors with the smallest angular difference. It does not handle cases where the input data is insufficient to form `n` vectors, and there is an error in the loop condition for processing the vectors. Additionally, the function might not correctly handle angle wrap-around cases.**
