RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The provided code snippet has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which makes it inefficient for large inputs (up to 100,000 vectors). This can lead to performance issues and timeouts. Although the logic for calculating the angle between vectors and finding the minimal angle is correct, the implementation does not meet the efficiency requirements for the given constraints. An optimal solution would involve sorting the vectors by their angles and then checking consecutive pairs.
