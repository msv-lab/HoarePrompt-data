Postcondition: **`min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `i` is less than 0, `j` is less than or equal to 2, `xi` and `yi` are assigned the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` and `yj` are assigned the values of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is `math.sqrt(xi)`, `magnitude_j` is `math.sqrt(xj)`, `angle` is `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`. If `angle` is less than `min_angle`, `min_angle` is assigned the value of `angle` and `ans` is updated to `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, `min_angle` and `ans` remain unchanged.**
