According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must currently be less than 0. 

Given that `_` is increased by 1 at each iteration, it means that in the state provided, `_` is at least -1 (since any higher value would stop the loop from executing). To ensure the loop can execute again, `_` should be less than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition is entirely dependent on `_`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` contains the tuple (x, y), `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers, variable `_` is less than 0**
