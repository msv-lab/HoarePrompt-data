`ans` is assigned the value of the pair of indices (i + 1, j + 1). Given that `i` is less than -1 and `j` is less than 0, the new values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` will still be negative or zero. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `min_angle` is `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`, `ans` is the pair of indices (i + 1, j + 1), `j` is less than 0, `i` is less than -1, `xi`, `yi` are assigned the values from `vectors[i]`, `xj`, `yj` are assigned the values from `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is the value of `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is the value of `math.sqrt(xi`, `magnitude_j` is the value of `math.sqrt(xj`, `angle` is the value of `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`**
