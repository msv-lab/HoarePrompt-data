`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, the output state is `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000**
