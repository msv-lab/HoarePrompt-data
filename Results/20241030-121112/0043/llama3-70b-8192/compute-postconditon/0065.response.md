Precondition: `min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `i` becomes less than 0, `j` becomes less than 0 + 1 which is less than 1, `xi` and `yi` are assigned the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` and `yj` are assigned the values of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is `math.sqrt(xi`

Program fragment:
```
if angle < min_angle:
    min_angle = angle
    ans = i + 1, j + 1
```

Postcondition for if body: `min_angle` is assigned the value of `angle`, `ans` is (i + 1, j + 1), `i` becomes less than 0, `j` becomes less than 0 + 1 which is less than 1, `xi` and `yi` are assigned the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` and `yj` are assigned the values of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is `math.sqrt(xi`

Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code

Postcondition: **`min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `i` becomes less than 0, `j` becomes less than 0 + 1 which is less than 1, `xi` and `yi` are assigned the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` and `yj` are assigned the values of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is `math.sqrt(xi`. If `angle` is less than `min_angle`, then `min_angle` is updated to `angle` and `ans` is updated to `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
