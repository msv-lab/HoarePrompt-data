To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the condition of the `while` loop. The condition for the loop to proceed is `_ < 0`. Therefore, the variable `_` must be less than 0.

Let's review the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000
- `vectors` contains the tuple (x, y) and has been appended with the new tuple (x, y)
- `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers
- Variable `_` is incremented by 1

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than 0.

Given the increment operation, if `_` was less than 0 before the increment, it might now be 0 or greater. Therefore, to ensure `_` is less than 0, we need to adjust `_` to be less than 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` contains the tuple (x, y) and has been appended with the new tuple (x, y), `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers, variable `_` is less than 0**
