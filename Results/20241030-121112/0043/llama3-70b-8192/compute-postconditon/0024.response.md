Output State: **`_` will retain its initial value, `vectors` will remain as described, `min_angle` is float('inf'), `ans` is (-1, -1), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `xi` and `yi` are the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` and `yj` are the values of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is math.sqrt(xi, `magnitude_j` is math.sqrt(xj ** 2 + yj ** 2)**
