`angle` is assigned the value `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`. The previous values of `dot_product`, `magnitude_i`, and `magnitude_j` are known variables. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `min_angle` is the smallest angle computed between the vectors, `ans` is the pair of indices (1-based) corresponding to the vectors that form this angle, `j` is less than 0, `i` is less than -1, `xi`, `yi` are assigned the values from `vectors[i]`, `xj`, `yj` are assigned the values from `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is the value of `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is the value of `math.sqrt(xi`, `magnitude_j` is the value of `math.sqrt(xj`, `angle` is the value of `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`**
