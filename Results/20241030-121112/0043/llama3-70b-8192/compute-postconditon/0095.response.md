`xj` and `yj` are assigned the values from `vectors[j]`. The values of `j` and `vectors` are not specified, but `j` is less than 0, so `xj` and `yj` are assigned the values from a negative index in the list `vectors`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `min_angle` is the smallest angle computed between the vectors, `ans` is the pair of indices (1-based) corresponding to the vectors that form this angle, `j` is less than 0, `i` is less than -1, `xi`, `yi` are assigned the values from `vectors[i]`, `xj`, `yj` are assigned the values from `vectors[j]`. If `n` is 0 or negative, `min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `j` is less than 0, `i` is less than -1, `xi`, `yi` are assigned the values from `vectors[i]`, `xj`, `yj` are assigned the values from `vectors[j]`.**
