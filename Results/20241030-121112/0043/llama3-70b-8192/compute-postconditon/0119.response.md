Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `min_angle` is the smallest angle computed between the vectors, `ans` is the pair of indices (1-based) corresponding to the vectors that form this angle, `j` is less than `n`, `i` is less than -1, `xi` is assigned the value of the x-component of `vectors[i]`, `yi` is assigned the value of the y-component of `vectors[i]`, `xj` is assigned the value of the x-component of `vectors[j]`, `yj` is assigned the value of the y-component of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is updated to the value of `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is updated to `math.sqrt(xi ** 2 + yi ** 2)`, `magnitude_j` is updated to `math.sqrt(xj)`, `angle` is `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`**
