_ is incremented by 1, and since _ was less than 0, it is now still less than 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` contains the tuple (x, y) and has been appended with the new tuple (x, y), `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers, variable `_` is less than 1.
