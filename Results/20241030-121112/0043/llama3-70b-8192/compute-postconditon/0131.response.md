Output State: **If `_` is negative initially, `vectors` will contain tuples `(x, y)` for each input pair until `_` becomes non-negative, and `_` will be non-negative. If `_` is 0 or positive initially, `vectors` will remain an empty list, and `_` will retain its initial value. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute. If `n` is positive and `i` starts at `n`, the outer loop will not execute, and the state will remain: `min_angle` as `float('inf')`, `ans` as `(-1, -1)`, `i` as `n`. If `i` starts less than 0, the loop executes as follows: `min_angle` is the smallest angle computed between the vectors, `ans` is the pair of indices (1-based) corresponding to the vectors that form this angle, `i` will be incremented until it is 0 or greater, and `j` will be incremented until it equals `n`. The function prints the values in `ans`.**
