Postcondition: **`_` will retain its initial value, `vectors` will remain as described, `min_angle` is either `float('inf')` or `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))` depending on whether `angle` is less than `min_angle` or not, `ans` is either `(-1, -1)` or `(n + 1, j + 1)` depending on whether `angle` is less than `min_angle` or not, `i` is `n`, `j` is less than `n`, `xi` and `yi` are the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` is the first element of `vectors[j]`, `yj` is the second element of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is `math.sqrt(xi^2 + yi^2)`, `angle` is `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`. If `angle` is less than `min_angle`, then `min_angle` is updated to `angle` and `ans` is set to `(i + 1, j + 1)`.**
