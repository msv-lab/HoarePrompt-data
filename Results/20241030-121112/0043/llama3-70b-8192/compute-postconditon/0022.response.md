`dot_product` is assigned the value of `xi * xj + yi * yj`. The values of `xi`, `yi`, `xj`, and `yj` are the coordinates of the vectors at indices `i` and `j` respectively in the `vectors` list. Given the initial state:

Output State: **`_` will retain its initial value, `vectors` will remain as described, `min_angle` is float('inf'), `ans` is (-1, -1), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `xi` and `yi` are the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` and `yj` are the values of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is `xi * xj + yi * yj`**
