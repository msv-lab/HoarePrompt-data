Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `min_angle` is angle, `ans` is the pair of indices (i + 1, j + 1), `j` is less than 0 and incremented by 1, `i` is less than -1, `xi`, `yi` are assigned the values from vectors[i], `xj`, `yj` are updated to the values from vectors[j], `dot_product` is the value of xi * xj + yi * yj, `magnitude_i` is math.sqrt(xi), `magnitude_j` is updated to math.sqrt(xj), `angle` is math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))**
