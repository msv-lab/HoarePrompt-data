According to the provided code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `_` is less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, the state is given as `_` is less than 1. This does not guarantee that `_` is less than 0, so the state of `_` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is less than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Since no other variables affect the loop condition, only the state of `_` needs to be modified.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` contains the tuple (x, y) and has been appended with the new tuple (x, y), `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers, variable `_` is less than 0**
