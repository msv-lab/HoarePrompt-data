`j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is less than -1, `j` will be less than 0. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `min_angle` is the smallest angle computed between the vectors, `ans` is the pair of indices (1-based) corresponding to the vectors that form this angle, `j` is less than 0, and `i` is less than -1. If `n` is 0 or negative, `min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `j` is less than 0, and `i` is less than -1.**
