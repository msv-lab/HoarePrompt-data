`xj` and `yj` are assigned the values of `vectors[j]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` will retain its initial value, `vectors` will remain as described, `min_angle` is float('inf'), `ans` is (-1, -1), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `xi` and `yi` are the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` and `yj` are the values of `vectors[j]`**
