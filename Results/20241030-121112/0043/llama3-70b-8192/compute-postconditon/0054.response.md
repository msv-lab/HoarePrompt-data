Output State: **If `j` starts at `n + 1` and is not less than `n`, the loop will not execute: `min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `i` becomes `n + 1`, and `j` remains `n + 1`. If `j` starts less than `n`, after execution: `min_angle` is either `float('inf')` or the smallest angle calculated, `ans` is either `(-1, -1)` or `(i + 1, j + 1)`, `i` becomes `n + 1`, and `j` will be incremented until it equals `n`.**
