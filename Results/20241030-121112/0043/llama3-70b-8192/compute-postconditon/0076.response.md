Postcondition: **`min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `i` becomes less than 0, `j` is less than 2, `xi` and `yi` are assigned the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` and `yj` are assigned the values of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is calculated as `math.sqrt(xi`. If `angle` is less than `min_angle`, then `min_angle` is updated to `angle` and `ans` is updated to `(i + 1, j + 1)`.**
