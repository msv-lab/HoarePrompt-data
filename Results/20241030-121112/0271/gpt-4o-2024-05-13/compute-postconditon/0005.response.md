`print(result)` outputs the value of `result`. The value of `result` is determined based on the value of `remainder`. The initial state provides the relationships and the ranges for `result` based on `remainder`. Therefore, the Output State is: 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9, `result` is an integer within the range of -9 to 10^9 and is either `n - remainder` if `remainder` ≤ 5 or `n + (10 - remainder)` if `remainder` > 5, and `result` is printed.**
