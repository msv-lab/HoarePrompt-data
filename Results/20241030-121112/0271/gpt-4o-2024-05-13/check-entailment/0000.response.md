Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where the remainder is exactly 5. According to the problem description, when the remainder is 5, the number can be rounded either up or down, but the given code always rounds down. For example, if `n = 15`, the code will always return `10`, whereas it could also be rounded to `20` as per the problem description. Therefore, the code does not meet the specification.
