Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly handles the task of rounding `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The logic is as follows:

1. If `n` is already a multiple of 10 (`n % 10 == 0`), the program prints `n` directly.
2. If the last digit of `n` (i.e., `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5, the program rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting the last digit from `n`.
3. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, the program rounds `n` up to the nearest multiple of 10 by adding the difference from the next multiple of 10 to `n`.

This approach covers all possible cases, including:
- Numbers that are already multiples of 10.
- Numbers where the last digit is less than or equal to 5.
- Numbers where the last digit is greater than 5.

The provided examples and additional edge cases have been handled correctly by the program. Therefore, the program meets the problem's requirements and is correct.
