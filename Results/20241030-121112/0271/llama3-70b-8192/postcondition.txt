`n` is an input integer. If `n` is a multiple of 10 (i.e., `n % 10 == 0`), the function prints `n`. If the last digit of `n` (i.e., `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5, the function prints `n` rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10. Otherwise, it prints `n` rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10.
