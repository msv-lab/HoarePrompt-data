`denominator` is assigned the value `1`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
