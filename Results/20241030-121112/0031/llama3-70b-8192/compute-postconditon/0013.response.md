`denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. Given that `total_days` is `2^n` and `denominator` is initially `2^(2n)`, the new value of `denominator` will be `2^(2n) * 2^n = 2^(3n)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is (2^n - k) * (2^n - (k + 1)) * (2^n - (k + 2)), `denominator` is 2^(3n), `i` is k + 2, `k` is less than -2**
