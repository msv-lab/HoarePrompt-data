The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.

Case_1: If `k` is greater than or equal to 0:
- The function returns the tuple (1, 1).

Case_2: If `k` is less than 0:
- The function computes `numerator` as the product of terms `(2^n - k) * (2^n - (k + 1)) * ... * (2^n - (-1))` divided by `gcd`.
- `denominator` is computed as `2^(n * abs(k))` divided by `gcd`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.
- The function returns the tuple `(numerator % (10^9 + 7), denominator % (10^9 + 7))`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 0, it returns the tuple (1, 1). If `k` is less than 0, it returns a tuple of the form `(numerator % (10^9 + 7), denominator % (10^9 + 7))`, where `numerator` and `denominator` are calculated based on the given formula and divided by their greatest common divisor.**
