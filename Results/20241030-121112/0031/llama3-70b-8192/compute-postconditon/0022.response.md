The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. The annotations and comments suggest that if `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the function should return the tuple (1, 1). If `k` is less than 0, it should return a tuple of the form `(numerator % (10^9 + 7), denominator % (10^9 + 7))`, where `numerator` and `denominator` are calculated based on a specific formula and divided by their greatest common divisor.

However, upon analyzing the code, there are several discrepancies and potential issues:

1. The function returns the modulo with `(10^6 + 3)` instead of `(10^9 + 7)`, as mentioned in the annotations.
2. The code does not explicitly handle edge cases where `n` or `k` might be outside the intended range or non-integer values.
3. The loop only runs if `k` is less than 0, and it calculates the numerator and denominator according to the given formula but does not handle potential overflows or very large values, which might be a concern given the range of `n`.

Given these observations, the functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 0, it returns the tuple (1, 1). If `k` is less than 0, it calculates `numerator` as the product of terms `(2^n - i)` for all `i` from `k` to -1, and `denominator` as `2^(n * abs(k))`, then returns the tuple `(numerator % (10^6 + 3), denominator % (10^6 + 3))`. Note that the function does not handle very large values gracefully and does not use the modulo `(10^9 + 7)` as indicated in the annotations.**
