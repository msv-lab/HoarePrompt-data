Output State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, and `i` is `k`, and `gcd` is 1. If `k` is less than 0, `numerator` is the product of terms `(2^n - k) * (2^n - (k + 1)) * ... * (2^n - (-1))`, `denominator` is `2^(n * abs(k))`, `i` is 0, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.**
