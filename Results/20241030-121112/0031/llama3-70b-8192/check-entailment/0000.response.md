Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Overflow Issue**: The code uses Python's arbitrary-precision integer handling, but the problem constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18) imply that the values can be extremely large, leading to potential overflow issues and inefficiencies in computation.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**: The method used to calculate the probability does not accurately compute the probability of at least two people having the same birthday. The birthday paradox problem requires calculating the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday first, and then subtracting that from 1.

3. **Simplification of Fraction**: The fraction simplification and modulo operation must be done correctly. The current approach does not ensure the numerator and denominator are coprime before taking modulo 10^6 + 3, which is required by the problem statement.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

For `n = 1` and `k = 10^18`:
- Total days in a year would be `2^1 = 2 days`
- With `k = 10^18` people, it is guaranteed that at least two people would share the same birthday. Thus, the probability should be 1 (A = B = 1).

However, the current program would not handle such a large value for `k` properly due to inefficiencies and overflow issues in the calculations. It would fail to return the correct simplified fraction modulo 10^6 + 3.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the probability of everyone having unique birthdays first.
2. Using the formula: \( P(\text{no shared birthday}) = \frac{(2^n)!}{(2^n - k)! \cdot 2^n^k} \)
3. Subtracting the above probability from 1 to get the probability of at least one shared birthday.
4. Simplifying the fraction and then taking modulo 10^6 + 3, ensuring the results are coprime as required.
