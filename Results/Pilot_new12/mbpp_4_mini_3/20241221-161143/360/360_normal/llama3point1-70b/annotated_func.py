#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (integers or floats).
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns the inner list from 'lists' that has the highest sum of its numerical elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats). It returns the inner list that has the highest sum of its numerical elements. If `lists` is empty, the function does not handle this case and would raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, the function assumes that `lists` is non-empty for successful execution.
