Correctness: **True**

The provided program does exactly what the problem description requires. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (referred to as `lists`). The function utilizes the built-in `max` function with the `key=sum` parameter, which effectively finds and returns the inner list that has the highest sum of its elements.

The logic is sound and adheres to the requirement of returning the list in a list of lists with the highest sum. Since the problem description specifies the function must return the inner list with the highest sum, the program correctly meets this criterion without any omissions or errors.

Thus, under the assumption that the input will always be well-formed as stated in the problem description, the program is considered correct in all evaluated scenarios.
