Final: **True**  

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function accurately returns the inner list from a list of lists that has the highest sum of numerical elements using the `max` function with `key=sum`. 

The annotations reinforce this conclusion by clarifying that the input is expected to be a list of lists of numerical elements (integers or floats), and that the function's intended behavior is to find and return the inner list with the highest total sum. Although the possibility of an empty input list yielding a `ValueError` is acknowledged, the assumption that valid input will be provided is a reasonable consideration in the context of the problem description.

Thus, the function behaves correctly for valid inputs as specified, confirming the correctness outlined in the original assessment.
