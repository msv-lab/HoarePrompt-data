Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The code provided returns the inner list with the highest sum of its elements, which works correctly when `lists` is non-empty. However, the output hints state that if `lists` is empty, the function does not handle this case and would raise a `ValueError`. Since the problem description specifies that the function should handle all cases, including potentially empty input, the lack of handling for an empty list means the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, it is considered incorrect.
