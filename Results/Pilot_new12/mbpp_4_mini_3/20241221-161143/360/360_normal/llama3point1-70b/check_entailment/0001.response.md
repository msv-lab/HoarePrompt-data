Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`lists`) as input and utilizes the `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`. This approach correctly identifies and returns the sublist (from the input list of lists) whose elements sum to the highest value.

To verify this, let's consider potential cases:

1. If the input is `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`, the sums would be `[3, 7, 5]` respectively, so the output would be `[3, 4]`, which has the highest sum.
2. If the input is `[[], [0, 0], [1, -1]]`, the sums would be `[0, 0, 0]`, and since all include the same sum, `max` will return the first occurring sublist with a sum of 0: `[]`.
3. If the input consists of all empty lists `...[[], [], []]`, it similarly returns the first empty list due to equal sums.

The function handles these cases correctly by leveraging Pythonâ€™s built-in functions, ensuring correct behavior in all conceivable scenarios based on the stated requirements in the description. As a result, there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail to meet the specification.

Therefore, the program is correct in all scenarios, and the correctness is confirmed as **True**.
