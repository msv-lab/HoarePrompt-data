Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the list that has the highest sum of its elements from a list of lists. The use of the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument effectively determines which sublist has the highest total sum. 

Here is why the code is correct for all cases:
1. If the input is an empty list (`lists = []`), the `max` function will raise a `ValueError` since there are no elements to choose from. This, however, is an edge case not typically specified in such problems.
2. The function will accurately compute the sum for any list of lists provided by the user and will return the sublist with the greatest sum.
3. It works correctly with negative numbers, zeros, and fluctuating values, ensuring that it identifies the list with the highest total.

There are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the described functionality for valid inputs, assuming the input lists contain at least one sublist.
