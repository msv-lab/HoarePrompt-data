Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`lists`) as input and returns the inner list with the highest sum of its numerical elements.

Here's how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (as stated in the annotations). This aligns perfectly with the input expectations defined in the problem description.

2. **Finding the Maximum**: The function utilizes the `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`. This means it effectively calculates the sum of each inner list and identifies which one has the highest sum, precisely fulfilling the requirement to return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

3. **Return Value**: The program correctly returns the inner list that has the highest sum of its numerical elements.

4. **Assumptions on Input**: The assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., non-empty list) is accepted per the problem statement. The program does not account for an empty input or invalid types, but since it is assumed that the user will provide a valid input, the correctness of the algorithm remains intact.

Thus, the function operates as intended according to the problem description, which leads to the conclusion that the program is correct.
