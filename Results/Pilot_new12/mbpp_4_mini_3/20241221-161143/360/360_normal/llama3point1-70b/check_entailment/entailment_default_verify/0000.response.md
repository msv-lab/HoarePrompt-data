Final: **True** 

The original assessment of correctness is accurate because the function `func_1` implements the required functionality effectively. It correctly returns the sublist with the highest sum of its elements when given a non-empty list of lists containing numerical values. The assessment accounts for edge cases like handling empty lists, acknowledging that a `ValueError` will occur in such situations, but this is deemed acceptable due to the assumption that the input will be valid and non-empty. The program behaves correctly for all valid inputs as specified, thus supporting the conclusion of correctness.
