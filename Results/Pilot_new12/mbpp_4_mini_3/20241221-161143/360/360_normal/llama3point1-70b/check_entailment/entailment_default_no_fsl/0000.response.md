Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is intended to return the sub-list from a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. However, it does not handle the case when the input `lists` is empty. According to the output hints, if `lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`, which means it does not meet the requirement of the problem description for every potential case. Since the function cannot handle this situation appropriately, it is deemed incorrect.
