Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats). It returns the inner list that has the highest sum of its numerical elements. If `lists` is empty, the function does not handle this case and would raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, the function assumes that `lists` is non-empty for successful execution.**
