The variable `current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of `sublist`. The value of `current_sum` now represents the total of the elements in `sublist`, which impacts its previous state. The values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
