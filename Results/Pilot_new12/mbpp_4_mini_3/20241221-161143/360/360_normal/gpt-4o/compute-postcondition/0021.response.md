Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (either integers or floats). It iterates over each sublist to compute the sum of its elements and identifies the sublist with the maximum sum. The function returns this sublist. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns an empty list. Additionally, if all sublists contain non-positive values, the function will return the sublist with the least negative sum, which may not be well captured in the annotations. The function does not handle cases where sublists may be empty, which could lead to misleading results for the sums. Therefore, an edge case exists where an empty sublist would have a sum of zero, potentially impacting the overall maximum if not accounted for.**
