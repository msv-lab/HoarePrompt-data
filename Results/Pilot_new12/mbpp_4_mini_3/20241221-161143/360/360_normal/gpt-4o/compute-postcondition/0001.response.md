The variable `max_list` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged since there are no operations affecting them. Therefore, the output state retains the information about `list_of_lists` and `max_sum`, while `max_list` is updated to an empty list.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list**
