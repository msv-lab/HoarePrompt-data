`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The value of `max_sum` remains float('-inf'), and `max_list` remains an empty list. However, `sublist` must contain elements, and therefore `current_sum` will be the total of these elements. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`**
