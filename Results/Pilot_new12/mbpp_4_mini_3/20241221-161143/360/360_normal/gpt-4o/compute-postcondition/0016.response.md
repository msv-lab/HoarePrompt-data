Given the initial state where `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is an empty list, and `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, the code snippet `max_list = sublist` assigns `sublist` to `max_list`. 

The impact of executing this line is that `max_list` changes from an empty list to the value of `sublist`. The variables  `max_sum` and `current_sum` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `sublist` to `max_list` while retaining the other variablesâ€™ conditions. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`**.
