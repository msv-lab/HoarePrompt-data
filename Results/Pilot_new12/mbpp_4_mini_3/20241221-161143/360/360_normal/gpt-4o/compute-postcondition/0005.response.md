The value of `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`, which was previously greater than `max_sum`. Therefore, `max_sum` now holds the value of `current_sum`, while `max_list` remains unchanged as an empty list. None of the other variables affect the outcome. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is greater than the previous value of `max_sum`.**
