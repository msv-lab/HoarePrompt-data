The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`. Previously, `max_sum` was set to float('-inf'), and it will now take the value of `current_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` remains an empty list, and `current_sum` retains its value. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
