The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`. Initially, `max_sum` is set to float('-inf') and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`. This means that the new value for `max_sum` will be whatever the calculated value of `current_sum` is, which is not specified here but will be greater than float('-inf'). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is the sum of the elements in `sublist`; `max_list` is an empty list; `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
