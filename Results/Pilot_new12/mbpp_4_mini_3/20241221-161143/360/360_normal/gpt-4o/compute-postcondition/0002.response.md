According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list (sublist). The initial values of `max_sum` and `max_list` do not impact the ability to execute the loop, but they may change during loop execution. At the start of the loop, `sublist` should represent the first list in `list_of_lists`.

State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**
