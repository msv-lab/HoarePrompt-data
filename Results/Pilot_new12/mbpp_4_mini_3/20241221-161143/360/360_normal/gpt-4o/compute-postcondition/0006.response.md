Given the initial state, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is an empty list, and `current_sum` is greater than the previous value of `max_sum`. 

The code assigns the value of the variable `sublist` to `max_list`. Since `max_list` was initially an empty list, it will now hold the contents of `sublist`. The values of `max_sum` and `current_sum` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is greater than the previous value of `max_sum`.**
