The value of `current_sum` is assigned as the sum of the elements in `sublist`. Initially, `max_sum` is set to float('-inf'), `max_list` remains an empty list, and `current_sum` is updated to reflect the total of the elements in `sublist`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
