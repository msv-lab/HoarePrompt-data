According to the code, the loop iterates over `list_of_lists`, processing each `sublist`. The loop will continue as long as there are more `sublist`s to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the previous `sublist`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `list_of_lists` must have at least one more `sublist` remaining. Since the current `sublist` has been processed, the next `sublist` will be the next in the `list_of_lists`, meaning it needs to be indexed appropriately.

Thus, if there are `N` sublists in total, and assuming we are currently processing the `M`-th sublist (where `M` is the index of `sublist`), for another iteration the index of `sublist` would be `M + 1`, and `list_of_lists` must have at least `M + 1` sublists.

State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the (M + 1)-th sublist, and `sublist` is the (M + 1)-th sublist from `list_of_lists`**
