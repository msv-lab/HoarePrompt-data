According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. The loop will execute for each sublist in `list_of_lists`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the current `sublist`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `list_of_lists` must contain additional sublists that have not yet been iterated through. If there are more sublists, then after the current iteration ends, the loop will pick the next sublist. The current sublist has already been processed and the next sublist will be read in the next iteration.

State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is the sum of the next sublist in `list_of_lists`**
