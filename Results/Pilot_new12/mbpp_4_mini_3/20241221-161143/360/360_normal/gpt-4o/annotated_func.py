#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (integers or floats).
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the sublist corresponding to `max_sum`, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_sum` remains float('-inf') and `max_list` remains an empty list.
    return max_list
    #The program returns the sublist corresponding to the maximum sum from `list_of_lists`, which is `max_list`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_list` remains an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (either integers or floats). It iterates over each sublist to compute the sum of its elements and identifies the sublist with the maximum sum. The function returns this sublist. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns an empty list. Additionally, if all sublists contain non-positive values, the function will return the sublist with the least negative sum, which may not be well captured in the annotations. The function does not handle cases where sublists may be empty, which could lead to misleading results for the sums. Therefore, an edge case exists where an empty sublist would have a sum of zero, potentially impacting the overall maximum if not accounted for.
