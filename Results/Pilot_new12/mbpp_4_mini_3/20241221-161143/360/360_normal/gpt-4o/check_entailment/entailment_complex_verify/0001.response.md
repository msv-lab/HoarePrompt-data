The original assessment states that the program is correct, and it provides reasoning based on the functionality described in the problem statement and the particular test cases. 

After reviewing the annotated version of the code, the reasoning behind the correctness, and the nuances provided by the annotations, I find the following points critical:

1. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of each sublist and determines the sublist with the highest sum as per the problem description.
2. The provided test cases validate that when given valid lists of lists, the function returns the expected sublist with the maximum sum.
3. The annotations correctly outline the state of variables (`max_sum` and `max_list`) after the loop, indicating that the function is designed to find the maximum sum sublist.
4. The identification of potential edge cases in the annotations, such as empty sublists, is valid. If any sublist is empty, it would incorrectly affect the sum comparisons leading to potential misrepresentation of the expected output. The function does not currently handle this scenario, which might lead to undetermined behavior in some cases.

Given these analyses, I conclude that while the function works correctly under the current assumptions (valid input and no empty sublists), the lack of handling for empty sublists or the document stating that it "returns an empty list" can lead to misleading results under unhandled edge cases.

Considering the problem description and the provided reasoning, the assessment that the function is correct is only partially accurate, and I believe the original assessment does not fully account for the limitations outlined in the annotations.

Final: **False**
