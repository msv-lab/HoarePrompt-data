The original assessment concluded that the program is correct, stating that the function `func_1` effectively calculates the sublist with the highest sum from a list of lists. The assertion tests provided in the original assessment indicated that the function returned the expected results in various scenarios.

Upon reviewing the annotated code, it confirms the logic present in `func_1`. The annotations clarify the program's behavior at different stages, particularly noting that `max_sum` correctly tracks the highest sum found during the execution and that `max_list` returns the corresponding sublist as required by the problem statement. The state annotations also reinforce that if the input is valid (which is assumed), the function handles the scenario correctly.

The key observation is that the state of the program after the loop indicates that if `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_list` will remain empty, which aligns with expectations since there would be no sublists to analyze in such a case. Even so, for non-empty inputs, the function is designed to properly assess and return the correct sublist with the highest sum.

Given this analysis, the original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness in accordance with the provided annotations and problem description.

Final: **True**
