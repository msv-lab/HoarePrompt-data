Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and iteratively calculates the sum of each sublist, tracking the maximum sum found and returning the corresponding sublist. 

Examining the test cases:
1. For the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]`, the sublist `[10, 11, 12]` has the highest sum of 33.
2. For `[[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]`, the sublist `[12, 11, 10]` has the highest sum of 33.
3. For `[[2, 3, 1]]`, there is only one sublist, which is returned as it is.

The program correctly handles different configurations and cases, including edge cases such as single-item sublists and varying lengths of sublists. There are no missing logic or edge cases identified that would lead to incorrect behavior based on the problem description. Thus, the implementation is sound and meets the requirements outlined.
