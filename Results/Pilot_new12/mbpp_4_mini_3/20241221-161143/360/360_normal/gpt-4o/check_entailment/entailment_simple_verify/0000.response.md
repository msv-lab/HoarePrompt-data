Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies that while the program behaves as expected under normal circumstances (i.e., with valid lists containing numerical elements), it does not handle certain edge cases appropriately. Specifically, if all the sublists are empty, the function will return an empty list instead of handling this case potentially more appropriately (like returning `None` or raising an exception). 

Based on the problem description, the function should return the sublist with the highest sum. In scenarios where there are no sublists to evaluate (empty input), the result of an empty list does not align with a likely interpretation of the problem requirement, which suggests that the program does not fully meet the criteria outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, the conclusion to label the program as "incorrect" remains justified.
