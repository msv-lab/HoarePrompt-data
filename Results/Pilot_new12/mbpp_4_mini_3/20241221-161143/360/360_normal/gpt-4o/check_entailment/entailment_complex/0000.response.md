Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where sublists may be empty. According to the problem description, the function should return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. However, if any of the sublists are empty, the current implementation will evaluate their sum as zero but will not correctly identify any valid non-empty sublist as the maximum sum list. 

For example:
- If the input is `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5]])`, the function would consider the empty sublist with a sum of 0 but it should return `[4, 5]` because it has a higher sum than the empty sublist.

This means that while it correctly finds and returns the sublist with the highest sum when all sublists have elements, it does not account for empty lists effectively, leading to incorrect results in such cases. Thus, the implementation fails to meet the complete requirements set forth in the problem description.
