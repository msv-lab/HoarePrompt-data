Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists, computes the sum of each inner list, and correctly identifies and returns the sublist whose sum of elements is the highest. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list, which allows it to correctly handle any sums of sublists regardless of their values.

2. **Iteration and Summation**: The for loop iterates through each sublist in the input list of lists. It calculates the sum of the current sublist and compares it to the maximum sum encountered so far.

3. **Comparison for Maximum**: If the current sum of the sublist is greater than `max_sum`, the program updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist. This ensures that at the end of the loop, `max_list` holds the sublist with the highest sum.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum. If all sublists have the same sum, the function will return the first one it encounters, which is in accordance with the problem description since it does not specify what to do in this scenario.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the scenario of an empty list of lists by initializing `max_list` to an empty list and leaving it unchanged if no sublists are present. Thus, it will return an empty list appropriately.

Overall, the logic is sound and adheres to the problem's requirements, leading to the conclusion that the program is correct.
