To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the program itself.

**Problem Description:** Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. This is appropriate to ensure that any sum from the input lists will replace the initial value.
2. It iterates through each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`.
3. It calculates the `current_sum` of the elements in each `sublist`.
4. If the `current_sum` is greater than the previously established `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and assigns the current `sublist` to `max_list`.
5. Finally, it returns `max_list`, which should be the sublist with the highest sum.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If there are empty lists within `list_of_lists`, the function will still work as the sum of an empty list is zero. However, it will not account for the case when all sublists are empty.
- If there are ties in the sum, for instance: `[[1, 2], [3], [2, 1]]`, both `sublist [1, 2]` and `[2, 1]` have the same sum but the function will only return the first one encountered.
- If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function currently returns an empty list, which is acceptable but may not align with the user's expectations, as there would be no valid sublist to return.

Considering these points, there exists at least one potential situation where the function does not correctly fulfill the problem description: when all sublists are empty, it may be expected by some interpretations of the problem to return `None` or raise an exception rather than an empty list.

Thus, based on these observations:

Correctness: **False**.
