The original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect due to its behavior under certain edge cases, specifically when handling empty sublists or various scenarios where sublists may contain negative or zero sums.

Upon reviewing the program against the problem description and the output hints, the following considerations solidify the assessment:

1. **Program Functionality**: The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum as prescribed in the problem description. This aligns with the expected functionality described in the output hints.

2. **Behavior for Empty Inputs**: While the program returns an empty list when `list_of_lists` is empty—which could be acceptable— the original assessment suggests that perhaps it should return `None` or raise an exception instead. However, this is based on a subjective expectation rather than a requirement explicitly outlined in the problem description.

3. **Handling of Sublists**: The mention that the program does not handle empty sublists and the potential for misleading results does not fundamentally break the program's adherence to the problem statement, as the sums of empty lists are logically zero and will not influence the outcome unless all sublists are empty themselves.

4. **Edge Cases Consideration**: The original assessment stated concerns about the function's behavior regarding empty sublists, but it may not adequately reflect the functionality expected based on the provided input data assumptions. Given that valid input is assumed and that negative sums are possible yet valid—returning the least negative can be considered acceptable behavior.

Considering these points, the original assessment's reasoning about the program being incorrect does not account for the aligned functionality described in the problem statement or the hints, as well as assumptions about input validity.

Thus, I believe the final assessment should be updated; the program meets the requirements of the problem description and should handle valid inputs adequately.

Final: **True**
