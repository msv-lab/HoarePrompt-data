Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where any of the sublists might be empty. If there's an empty sublist, it will not contribute to the sum calculation, and depending on the implementation, it could incorrectly determine that the maximum sum is from an empty list or produce misleading results. 

For instance, given the input `list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]`, the function would return `[3, 4]`, which is correct in terms of maximum sum. However, if the input were `list_of_lists = [[], [0], [-1], [-2]]`, the function would return `[0]`, which is misleading as it doesn't appropriately address the empty sublists. 

Thus, since the program does not account for the scenario of empty sublists and can lead to incorrect conclusions based on that, the correctness claim is `False`.
