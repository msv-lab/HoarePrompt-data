The program provided, `func_1`, aims to identify and return the sublist from a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. 

Upon inspecting the program and the hints provided:

1. The assertion examples confirm that the function correctly returns the sublist with the greatest sum.
2. However, the output hints indicate that there may be an edge case when dealing with empty sublists, as the function does not handle this scenario. If an empty sublist exists within the list of lists, the `sum` will return 0 for that sublist, which can affect the determination of the maximum sum incorrectly by treating it as a valid candidate.
3. As per the output hints, it states that if `list_of_lists` is empty, the function should return an empty list, but the program does not explicitly account for that situation.

Given these points, the program fails to handle edge cases adequately. Specifically, an empty sublist impacts the determination of the maximum sum, while the lack of handling for fully empty input leads toward incorrect behavior according to the description provided.

Correctness: **False**.
