You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the program itself.

**Problem Description:** Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. This is appropriate to ensure that any sum from the input lists will replace the initial value.
2. It iterates through each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`.
3. It calculates the `current_sum` of the elements in each `sublist`.
4. If the `current_sum` is greater than the previously established `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and assigns the current `sublist` to `max_list`.
5. Finally, it returns `max_list`, which should be the sublist with the highest sum.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If there are empty lists within `list_of_lists`, the function will still work as the sum of an empty list is zero. However, it will not account for the case when all sublists are empty.
- If there are ties in the sum, for instance: `[[1, 2], [3], [2, 1]]`, both `sublist [1, 2]` and `[2, 1]` have the same sum but the function will only return the first one encountered.
- If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function currently returns an empty list, which is acceptable but may not align with the user's expectations, as there would be no valid sublist to return.

Considering these points, there exists at least one potential situation where the function does not correctly fulfill the problem description: when all sublists are empty, it may be expected by some interpretations of the problem to return `None` or raise an exception rather than an empty list.

Thus, based on these observations:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numerical elements (integers or floats).
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the sublist corresponding to `max_sum`, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_sum` remains float('-inf') and `max_list` remains an empty list.
    return max_list
    #The program returns the sublist corresponding to the maximum sum from `list_of_lists`, which is `max_list`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_list` remains an empty list.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
