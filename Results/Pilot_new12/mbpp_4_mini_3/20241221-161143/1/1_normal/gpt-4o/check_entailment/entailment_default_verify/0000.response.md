Final: **True** 

The original assessment that the program is correct is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies common elements between two input lists, returns them as a sorted tuple, and handles the requirements outlined in the problem description effectively. The assessment aligns well with the output hints, which confirm that the function manages duplicates by returning only unique common elements and provides correct outputs as demonstrated in the test cases. The function handles valid input gracefully and performs as expected for the given purpose, confirming its correctness.
