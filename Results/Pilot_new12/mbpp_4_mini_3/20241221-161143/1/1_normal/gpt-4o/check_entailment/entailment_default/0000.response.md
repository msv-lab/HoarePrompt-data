The provided function `func_1` takes two lists as inputs, computes the intersection to identify common elements, and returns them as a sorted tuple. 

The output hints explain that the function does this correctly, returning a sorted tuple of unique common elements and an empty tuple if there are no common elements. The assertions provided in the program examples confirm it works for specific test cases.

Examining the implementation of the program:
- It converts `list1` and `list2` to sets, which eliminates duplicates in both lists.
- It computes the intersection using the `&` operator, which gives common elements.
- The resulting set of common elements is sorted and returned as a tuple.

Key considerations based on the problem description and the hints:
- The function is expected to return unique common elements, which it does by leveraging sets.
- Sorting is correctly applied, ensuring the output is in ascending order.
- The function handles cases where there may be no common elements, resulting in an empty tuple.

No potential edge cases or failures in handling possible input scenarios have been found within the clear specifications given, as it properly treats valid cases expected as outlined.

Therefore, the program operates correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
