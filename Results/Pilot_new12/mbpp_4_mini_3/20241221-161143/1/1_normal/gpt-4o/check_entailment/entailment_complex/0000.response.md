Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The task is to find the shared elements from two lists, and the `func_1` function accurately implements this functionality. Here's why:

1. **Intersection of Lists**: The function takes two input lists, `list1` and `list2`, and finds the common elements between them. This is achieved by converting both lists into sets and using the intersection operator (`&`). This ensures that only the elements present in both lists are considered.

2. **Return Type**: The function returns the common elements as a tuple. The common elements are sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function before converting them to a tuple, which satisfies the requirement for the output format.

3. **Handling of Duplicates**: Since sets are used, any duplicate entries in the input lists are automatically filtered out, ensuring that the output contains only unique elements. This aligns with the requirement to return unique common elements.

4. **Output for No Common Elements**: If there are no common elements, the intersection will be an empty set, and `sorted()` will result in an empty list, which converts to an empty tuple (`()`), thus adhering to the specification of the function returning an empty tuple if there are no common elements.

5. **Test Assertions**: The provided assertions demonstrate that the function returns the expected results for given test cases, confirming its correctness across varied inputs.

In summary, the function fulfills all conditions outlined in the problem description, providing the correct output for all potential inputs under the assumed valid conditions.
