Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to find shared elements between two given lists, which is stated in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the specified requirements:

1. **Input Handling:** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are consistent with the type of input described (lists). 

2. **Finding Shared Elements:** It converts both lists to sets and performs an intersection to find common elements (`set(list1) & set(list2)`). This operation effectively identifies all shared elements between the two lists.

3. **Return Type:** The function returns these common elements as a sorted tuple, which is a reasonable and valid response format.

4. **Test Cases:** The provided assertions verify that the function behaves as expected for multiple cases, yielding the correct tuples of shared elements.

No potential cases described in the problem would cause the program to fail its purpose, as it is designed to find common elements irrespective of the types of elements contained in the lists (assuming they are all hashable). Thus, it fulfills the problem's requirements accurately.
