Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements between two lists. It does this by converting both input lists into sets, using the intersection operator (`&`) to find common elements, and then returning them as a sorted tuple.

All provided test cases, including `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`, correctly verify that the function identifies `4` and `5` as common elements; similarly for the other cases.

Since the intersection operation will work with any items in the lists (whether they are integers, strings, etc.) and will capture all duplicates only once, the function behaves correctly for the described task. The sorting ensures the output meets the requirement for the results to be in a certain order. No edge cases or unexpected input types cause failure in the provided logic. Thus, I believe the function meets all potential cases as outlined in the problem description.
