Final: **True** 

Reasoning: The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to find the shared elements between two lists. The annotated code accurately describes the state of the program and the functionality of the `func_1` function, confirming that it computes the intersection of two lists. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works correctly for various test cases, returning the expected sorted tuples of common elements.

The handling of duplicates and the eventual output of unique elements, sorted in ascending order, aligns with the problem requirements. The original assessment is supported by the annotations, which confirm that the function behaves as expected under the given constraints and assumptions about input validity. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
