Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of finding shared elements between two lists. It accurately calculates the intersection using set operations, ensuring that duplicates are eliminated and only unique common elements are returned. The annotations reaffirm this by confirming the list types, the intersection logic, and the sorted output.

Furthermore, the provided test assertions validate that the expected outputs match the results from the function for various input scenarios. Since the annotations describe the behavior of the function in accordance with the problem description and confirm that it meets all potential cases, the program can be deemed correct. There are no discrepancies between the original assessment and the information provided, warranting a final conclusion of program correctness.
