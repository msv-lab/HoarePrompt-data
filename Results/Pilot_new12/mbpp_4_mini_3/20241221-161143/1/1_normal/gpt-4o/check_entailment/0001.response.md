Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements between two lists. It converts both input lists into sets, computes their intersection, and then returns the result as a sorted tuple. The use of the intersection operator (`&`) effectively finds the common elements between the two sets. 

The assertions provided cover various examples, and they all produce the expected results. Additionally, since the output is sorted, the order of common elements is consistent, which adheres to the problem description requirements.

Given that all tested cases and typical cases (e.g., empty lists, lists with no common elements) will be handled correctly by the intersection of sets and the conversion to sorted tuples, I cannot find any potential case where the program fails to perform as expected. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
