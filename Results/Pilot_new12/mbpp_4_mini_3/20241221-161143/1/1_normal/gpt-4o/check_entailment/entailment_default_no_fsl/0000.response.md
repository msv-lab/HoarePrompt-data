Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between two input lists, as specified in the problem description. 

1. It converts both input lists into sets, which automatically handles the uniqueness of elements.
2. The intersection of these two sets is computed using the `&` operator, resulting in a set of common elements.
3. The common elements are then sorted and returned as a tuple.

The output hints accurately reflect the functionality of the code, noting that if there are no common elements, an empty tuple will be returned, which is consistent with the expected behavior when no intersection exists. The examples provided in the assertions validate that the function behaves as intended for various typical cases.

Therefore, the function fulfills the requirements for every potential case outlined in the problem description, and thus I conclude with Correctness: **True**.
