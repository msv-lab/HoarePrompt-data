Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately identifies the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is indeed designed to find shared elements between two lists correctly, as evidenced by the intersection of the converted sets, which is verified by the assertions in the code. The annotations confirm that the state of the program is appropriate and the output meets the expectations outlined in the problem description. Additionally, the function's handling of various valid input cases and the assurance that the inputs will be valid solidify its correctness. Therefore, no discrepancies are found, and the program is affirmed to function as intended.
