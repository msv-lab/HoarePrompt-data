The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists that can contain any type of elements. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted tuple of the common elements that are found in both lists. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2` and return a sorted tuple of elements that are common to both lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted tuple of the common elements found in both lists.**
