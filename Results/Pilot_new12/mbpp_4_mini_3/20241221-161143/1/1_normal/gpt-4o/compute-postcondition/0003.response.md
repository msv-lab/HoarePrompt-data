Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and computes the intersection of these lists to identify common elements. It then returns a sorted tuple containing these common elements. If there are no common elements, the function will return an empty tuple. The input lists can contain any type of elements, including duplicates, but the output will only include unique common elements, sorted in ascending order.**
