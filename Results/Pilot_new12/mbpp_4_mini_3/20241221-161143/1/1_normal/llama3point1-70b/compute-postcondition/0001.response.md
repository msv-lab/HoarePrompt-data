The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are lists that may contain any type of elements. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements found in both lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists and return a tuple representing the common elements present in both lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, test_tup1 and test_tup2, and returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements found in both lists.**
