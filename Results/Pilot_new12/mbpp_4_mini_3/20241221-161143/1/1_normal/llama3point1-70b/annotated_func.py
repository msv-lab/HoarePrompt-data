#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists that may contain any type of elements.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements found in both lists test_tup1 and test_tup2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are expected to be iterable collections (such as lists or tuples) containing any type of elements. It converts both collections into sets and computes their intersection, resulting in a new set containing only the elements that are present in both input collections. This intersection set is then converted back into a tuple and returned. The function effectively filters out duplicate elements from the intersection and does not account for cases where the input collections might be empty; if both are empty, the function will return an empty tuple. In summary, the final output is a tuple containing the unique elements that are common to both input collections.
