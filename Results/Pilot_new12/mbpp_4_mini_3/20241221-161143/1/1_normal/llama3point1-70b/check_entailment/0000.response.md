Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly handles the problem of finding shared elements between two lists (or tuples), as specified in the problem description. It uses the `set` data structure to compute the intersection of the two input tuples, obtaining the common elements efficiently. 

Key points that confirm its correctness:
1. It converts both input tuples into sets, which allows for easy calculation of shared elements using the `&` operator.
2. The returned value is a tuple containing only the shared elements.
3. The function handles cases where the tuples are empty or contain no common elements by returning an empty tuple, which aligns with the expected behavior of finding shared elements. 

No potential edge cases expose flaws in this implementation under the given problem description, confirming that it works correctly for all conceivable inputs.
