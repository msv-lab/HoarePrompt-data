Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` effectively addresses the problem of finding shared elements between the two input lists (or tuples) as specified. The annotations confirm that the function converts the input collections to sets, computes their intersection, and returns the result as a tuple, thereby adhering to the problem description.

Key supporting points from the annotated version include:
1. The function is designed to accept iterable collections (lists or tuples) and computes the intersection without duplicating elements.
2. The handling of empty input collections by returning an empty tuple aligns with the expected behavior for finding shared elements.
3. The program's assumptions about valid input further confirm that edge cases (such as invalid types or emptiness) do not need to be explicitly handled.

Overall, the annotations reinforce the correctness of the initial assessment, leading to the conclusion that the program behaves as intended.
