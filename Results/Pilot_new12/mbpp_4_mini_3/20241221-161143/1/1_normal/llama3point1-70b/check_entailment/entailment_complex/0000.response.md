Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists (or any iterable collections) as input and computes the shared elements between them. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Intersection Calculation**: The program converts the input lists to sets and calculates their intersection using the `&` operator. The intersection operation effectively filters out unique elements that are common to both lists.

2. **Return Type**: The result of the intersection is converted back into a tuple, which aligns with the requirement to return the shared elements.

3. **Handling of Input Types**: The function is designed to work with any type of elements, as stated in the problem description. Additionally, the function handles empty lists correctly by returning an empty tuple if both input lists are empty.

4. **Output Consistency**: The output is consistent with the expected behavior mentioned in the description. It produces a tuple containing unique elements that are present in both input collections.

Since the function adheres to the outlined requirements without overlooking any potential cases in the expected input (assuming valid inputs as mentioned), it is indeed correct.
