Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The program successfully finds shared elements between two lists (or tuples) by using sets to compute their intersection. 

The annotated version supports this conclusion, indicating that the function returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements found in both input lists. Additionally, it confirms that the function handles various cases, such as when inputs are empty or have no shared elements, correctly by returning an empty tuple, thus aligning with the expected behavior.

Both the original assessment and the annotations demonstrate that the program meets the problem requirements, confirming its correctness.
