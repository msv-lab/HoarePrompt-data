You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists that may contain any type of elements.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the intersection of elements found in both lists test_tup1 and test_tup2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are expected to be iterable collections (such as lists or tuples) containing any type of elements. It converts both collections into sets and computes their intersection, resulting in a new set containing only the elements that are present in both input collections. This intersection set is then converted back into a tuple and returned. The function effectively filters out duplicate elements from the intersection and does not account for cases where the input collections might be empty; if both are empty, the function will return an empty tuple. In summary, the final output is a tuple containing the unique elements that are common to both input collections.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
