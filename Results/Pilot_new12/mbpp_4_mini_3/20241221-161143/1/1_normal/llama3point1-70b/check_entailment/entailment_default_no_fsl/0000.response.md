Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. It defines a function that takes two iterable collections (lists or tuples) as input and finds the shared elements between them. The use of sets to compute the intersection ensures that any duplicate elements are filtered out, which aligns with the expected behavior.

Furthermore, in cases where both input collections are empty, the program will return an empty tuple, which is consistent with the behavior outlined in the output hints. The logic is sound for all valid input scenarios, including when both collections are empty or contain identical elements. As all potential cases that conform to the assumption of valid input are handled correctly, the program fulfills the requirements.

In summary, the program meets the specification outlined in the problem description and correctly processes the inputs to produce the expected outputs across all considered cases.
