#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns radians equivalent to the angle 'degrees' by converting it using the formula degrees * (math.pi / 180)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a numeric input 'degrees' representing an angle in degrees and converts it to its equivalent in radians using the formula degrees * (math.pi / 180). The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-numeric inputs or angles outside the typical range for trigonometric functions. After execution, the final state of the program is that it returns the calculated radians.
