The function accepts a numeric input 'degrees' representing an angle in degrees and converts it to its equivalent in radians using the formula degrees * (math.pi / 180). The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-numeric inputs or angles outside the typical range for trigonometric functions. After execution, the final state of the program is that it returns the calculated radians.
