The original assessment evaluated the correctness of the program based on the placement of the function definition and the assertions executed before the function was defined, leading to a `NameError`. This reasoning is valid; the assertions would indeed fail because `func_1` would be undefined at that point in the code.

However, the annotated version of the code clarifies the behavior of `func_1` when it is eventually defined. The function accurately converts degrees to radians using the formula `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`, which meets the requirement of the problem description. While the annotations mention that the function does not handle edge cases like negative degrees or values over 360 degrees, the problem description does not impose any constraints indicating that such cases need to be handled.

The assumption we are working under is that valid inputs are always provided, and thus, the presence of these unhandled cases does not automatically render the program incorrect based on the given problem description. The core functionality, to convert degrees to radians, is effectively implemented.

Based on this analysis, while the original assessment correctly identified the scope of failure due to the undeclared function at the point of assertion, the main functionality of the program—once the function is defined—performs correctly as per the problem description.

Considering all these factors, the final conclusion is:

Final: **False**
