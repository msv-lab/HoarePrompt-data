The original assessment states that the correctness of the program is **False**. This is supported by the fact that the function `func_1` is defined after the assertions, leading to a `NameError` when attempting to call it before its definition. Additionally, it mentions that the program does not account for negative degrees or values greater than 360 degrees, which could indeed cause issues depending on the broader interpretation of the problem description.

However, the output hints provided indicate that the function is correctly operating under the assumption of valid numeric input and that it uses the formula to convert degrees to radians correctly. They also mention that it does not handle edge cases like non-numeric inputs or angles outside the typical range for trigonometric functions, which may or may not be necessary depending on how strictly we interpret the problem requirements.

Given that the original assessment highlights that `func_1` is not defined at the point of its use in the assertions, and that these assertions would fail as a result, I find the original assessment is accurate. 

Thus, the final assessment remains aligned with the original finding.

Final: **False**
