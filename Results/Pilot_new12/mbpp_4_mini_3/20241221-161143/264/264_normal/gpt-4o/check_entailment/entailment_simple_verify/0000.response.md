Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The main issue is that the function `func_1` is defined after its assertions, which results in a `NameError` when executing the assertions. The assertions attempt to call `func_1` before it has been defined, leading to failure in the program's execution. Additionally, while the provided program correctly converts degrees to radians, the assessment correctly points out that it does not handle negative angles or angles greater than 360 degrees, although this is less critical given the assumption of valid input. However, the immediate concern of the function being called before its definition takes precedence in determining the overall correctness of the program.
