Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program successfully implements the functionality required by the problem description to convert degrees to radians. The function `func_1` correctly uses the formula \( \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \), which is the mathematical standard for this conversion. 

The annotations clarify the expected input and output. They confirm that the function receives a numeric value representing degrees and returns the corresponding radians, as specified. The specific assertions provided in the program successfully test known values (90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees), which match the expected results for their conversion to radians.

While the annotations mention that the function does not handle non-numeric inputs or edge cases outside the typical range, it is indicated that inputs are assumed to be valid. Considering the problem description and the assumptions regarding input validity, these factors do not detract from the overall correctness of the program. 

Thus, the function both meets the requirement of the problem and operates correctly as evidenced by the assertions, confirming that the original assessment of correctness is justified.
