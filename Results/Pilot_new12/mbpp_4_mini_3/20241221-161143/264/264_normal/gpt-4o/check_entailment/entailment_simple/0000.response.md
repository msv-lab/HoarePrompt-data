Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a numeric input, `degrees`, which represents an angle in degrees, and converts it to radians using the formula:

\[ \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right) \]

The assertions in the program test the function with various inputs to ensure that it correctly calculates the radians equivalent of the given degree values. The calculations performed in the function align with the mathematical conversion between degrees and radians.

Since the function:
1. Accepts valid numeric inputs (which we assume based on the problem description).
2. Applies the correct conversion formula for degrees to radians.
3. Returns the expected values as demonstrated in the assertions.

Thus, it fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description, making the program correct.
