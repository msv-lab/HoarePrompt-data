Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function `func_1` that converts degrees to radians. The conversion formula used—multiplying degrees by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\)—is mathematically accurate for converting angles from degrees to radians. 

The assertions provided also check specific known values for 90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees, which correctly correspond to radians of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\frac{\pi}{3}\), and \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\), respectively.

Additionally, the formula operates consistently for all degree values, both positive and negative, as well as zero. Since the function adheres to the mathematical definition of degrees to radians conversion and passes the assertions, there are no evident edge cases or errors.

Thus, the program is functioning as expected according to the problem description.
