Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is defined after the assertions, which causes the assertions (`assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966`, etc.) to fail because `func_1` has not yet been defined when the assertions are executed. Therefore, this code will raise a `NameError`, indicating that `func_1` is not defined at that point. 

Additionally, the program does not account for negative degrees or values greater than 360 degrees, which may need consideration based on the problem description. 

Thus, there are cases where the program does not work as expected.
