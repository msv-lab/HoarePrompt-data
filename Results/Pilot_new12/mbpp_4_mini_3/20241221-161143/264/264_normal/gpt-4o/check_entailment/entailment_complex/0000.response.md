Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function, `func_1`, that converts degrees to radians, which directly addresses the problem description. The mathematical formula used in the function is accurate: it multiplies the degree value by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\) to convert the angle from degrees to radians. 

Additionally, the provided assertions confirm that the function returns the expected results for specific test cases:
- For 90 degrees, it returns approximately 1.5708 radians.
- For 60 degrees, it returns approximately 1.0472 radians.
- For 120 degrees, it returns approximately 2.0944 radians.

The explanations and comments in the code provide clear reasoning for how the function achieves its goal, stating that it accepts a numeric input representing an angle in degrees and returns the corresponding value in radians. 

Since it is assumed that the input will always be valid based on the problem description, the lack of error handling for non-numeric inputs or angles outside the usual range does not impact the correctness of the solution itself. Therefore, the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.
