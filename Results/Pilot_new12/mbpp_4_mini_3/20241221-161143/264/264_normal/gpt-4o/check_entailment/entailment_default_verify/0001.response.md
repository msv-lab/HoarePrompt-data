Based on the analysis of the provided program, problem description, and original assessment, the following points can be made:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that converts degrees to radians. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that using the well-known formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \).

2. **Program Behavior**: The function is implemented correctly, as shown by the mathematical formula it employs. The function has assertions that test the conversion against known values for degrees of 90, 60, and 120, which correspond accurately to their respective radian values.

3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment states that the correctness of the function is **True** based on the fact that the function adheres to the mathematical definition and passes the assertions. This is indeed supported by evidence from the assertions that demonstrate the function's correct operation for specified inputs.

4. **Output Hints Consideration**: The output hints indicate that the function does not handle certain edge cases, such as non-numeric inputs or angles outside a certain range. However, the task assumes valid numeric input, and those edges cases do not detract from the fundamental correctness of the function in the context of the problem description. The function will return the correct value for any valid numeric input.

Given these points, the original assessment remains valid: the function does correctly convert degrees to radians according to the problem description and the mathematical formula.

Final: **True**
