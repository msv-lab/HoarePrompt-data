Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right) \). All assertions for known values have returned correct results, consistent with the mathematical principles of conversion from degrees to radians.

The annotations also support this correctness, clarifying that the `degrees` input is expected to be a numeric value representing an angle, which is consistent with the function's behavior. Therefore, since the program meets the problem description and is supported by the provided annotations, the final assessment confirms its correctness.
