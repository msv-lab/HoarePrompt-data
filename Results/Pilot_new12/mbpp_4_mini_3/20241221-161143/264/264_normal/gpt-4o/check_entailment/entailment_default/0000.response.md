Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code implements the conversion of degrees to radians correctly using the formula `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. The function handles the provided examples correctly, returning the expected results for inputs of 90, 60, and 120 degrees. The output hints indicate that the function does not handle non-numeric inputs or angles outside the typical range, but since it is assumed that the input will always be valid numeric values representing degrees, we can conclude that the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description for the expected valid inputs. Thus, the function is correct for the problem's intended use.
