Correctness: **False**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`, and it produces the correct outputs for the given assertions (90 degrees to radians, 60 degrees to radians, and 120 degrees to radians). However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-numeric inputs or angles outside the typical range for trigonometric functions. Since the problem description implies that the function should work under all potential cases, including these edge cases, the function does not fully meet the requirements. For example, if the input passed to the function is a string (like `"90"`), it will raise a `TypeError`, thus demonstrating a scenario where the function does not work correctly. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case.
