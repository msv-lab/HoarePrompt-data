The function `func_1` accepts a numeric parameter `deg`, which represents an angle in degrees. It converts this angle from degrees to radians by multiplying it by Ï€/180 and returns the resulting value. The function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as non-numeric inputs or extreme values for `deg`, and it does not raise any exceptions or errors if such cases occur. Therefore, while the function aims to convert degrees to radians, its lack of input validation may lead to incorrect behavior if unexpected input types are provided.
