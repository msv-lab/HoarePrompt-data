The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `deg`. `deg` is a numeric value that represents an angle in degrees. After executing the function body, the program returns the angle in radians obtained by multiplying `deg` by π/180. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and return the corresponding angle in radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter deg, which is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees, and returns the angle in radians by multiplying deg by π/180.**
