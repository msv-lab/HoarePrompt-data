Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(deg)` correctly implements the mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians, which is:

\[ \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \]

The annotations clarify that the input `deg` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees, and the output is computed correctly with respect to the conversion formula. Although the annotated version mentions a lack of input validation and potential edge cases, the original assessment operates under the assumption that valid numeric input will be provided, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, as long as the input remains within the domain intended by the function's usage, the program correctly meets its purpose. Thus, the final assessment remains as originally stated: the program is correct.
