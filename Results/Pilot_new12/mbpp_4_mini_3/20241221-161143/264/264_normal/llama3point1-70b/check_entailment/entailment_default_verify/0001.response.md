After analyzing the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment, and the output hints, I conclude the following:

The program's function `func_1` correctly implements the mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians. The original assessment stated that the function is correct, which aligns with the mathematical accuracy of the conversion provided. The output hints indicate that the function does not handle edge cases, such as non-numeric inputs or extreme values, leading to potential issues if unexpected input types are used. However, since the problem description assumes valid numeric inputs, the function operates correctly within the expected input space.

Given that the function meets the requirements of the problem description, the original assessment is justified. The lack of error handling does not change the correctness of the conversion itself, as we are assuming that valid inputs will be provided.

Final: **True**
