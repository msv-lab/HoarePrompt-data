Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` aims to convert an angle given in degrees to radians, which it does correctly by using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle potential edge cases, such as non-numeric inputs (e.g., strings, lists) or extreme numeric values (e.g., very large or very small numbers). 

While the code may work correctly for valid numeric inputs (such as integers and floats representing degrees), it fails to ensure that the input conforms to the expected type. If a user were to input a non-numeric value, the function would raise a `TypeError` at runtime, meaning that it does not fulfill its expected behavior as per the problem description in every potential case.

Thus, since the function does not handle inputs correctly for every case (i.e., non-numeric inputs), we conclude that it is incorrect.
