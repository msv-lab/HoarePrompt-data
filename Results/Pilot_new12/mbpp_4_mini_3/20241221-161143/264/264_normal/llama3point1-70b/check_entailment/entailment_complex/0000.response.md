Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` adheres to the problem description of converting degrees to radians. The function takes a numeric input `deg`, which represents an angle in degrees, and converts it to radians using the formula:

\[ \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \]

This is the correct mathematical conversion, and the function returns the result as expected. The comments throughout the code clearly explain the function's purpose and the operations performed, aligning with the problem description.

As per the assumptions laid out in the task, we trust that the input will be valid, meaning `deg` will always be a numeric value. Therefore, while the function does not include input validation (which technically might be a concern in a strict sense), it still fulfills the stated requirements of the problem, thus confirming its correctness.

In conclusion, since the function satisfactorily converts degrees to radians for all valid inputs as required, it is correct.
