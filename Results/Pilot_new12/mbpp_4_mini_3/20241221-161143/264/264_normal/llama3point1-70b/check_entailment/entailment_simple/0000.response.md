Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians as per the problem description. It takes a numeric input `deg`, representing an angle in degrees, and uses the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \) to return the equivalent angle in radians. The formula is mathematically accurate, and since the input is assumed to be valid, the function will consistently provide the correct output for any numeric degree input. Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
