Correctness: **False**

The program aims to convert degrees to radians, which it does correctly using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-numeric inputs. For example, if a string or None is passed to the function instead of a numeric value, it will raise a TypeError. Thus, the program fails to ensure correctness for all potential cases, including valid numeric inputs as specified in the problem description. Since the function does not manage invalid inputs and could lead to runtime errors, it does not meet the requirements for correctness.
