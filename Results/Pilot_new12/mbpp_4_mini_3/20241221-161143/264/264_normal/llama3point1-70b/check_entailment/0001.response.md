Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians. The formula used in the function `func_1(deg)` is mathematically accurate, as the formula for converting degrees to radians is:

\[ \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \]

This formula holds true for all inputs, including positive and negative degree values, as well as zero. 

I cannot think of any edge cases or inputs where the function would not work as expected, meaning that it behaves correctly for the entirety of the input space pertaining to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct, and returns the expected output for all potential cases.
