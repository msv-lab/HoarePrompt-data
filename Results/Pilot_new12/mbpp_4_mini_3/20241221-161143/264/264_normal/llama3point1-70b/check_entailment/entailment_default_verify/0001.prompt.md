You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians. The formula used in the function `func_1(deg)` is mathematically accurate, as the formula for converting degrees to radians is:

\[ \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \]

This formula holds true for all inputs, including positive and negative degree values, as well as zero. 

I cannot think of any edge cases or inputs where the function would not work as expected, meaning that it behaves correctly for the entirety of the input space pertaining to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct, and returns the expected output for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a numeric parameter `deg`, which represents an angle in degrees. It converts this angle from degrees to radians by multiplying it by Ï€/180 and returns the resulting value. The function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as non-numeric inputs or extreme values for `deg`, and it does not raise any exceptions or errors if such cases occur. Therefore, while the function aims to convert degrees to radians, its lack of input validation may lead to incorrect behavior if unexpected input types are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
