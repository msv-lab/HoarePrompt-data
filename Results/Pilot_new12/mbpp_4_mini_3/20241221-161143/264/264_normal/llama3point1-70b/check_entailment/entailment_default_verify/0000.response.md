Final: **False**

The original assessment stated the program's correctness as **True**, aligning with its intended functionality of converting degrees to radians. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle edge cases such as non-numeric inputs or extreme values for `deg`. While the problem description assumes valid input, the lack of error handling for unexpected input can lead to incorrect behavior in practical scenarios. Therefore, despite the function's mathematical correctness for valid numeric inputs, its overall robustness and correctness cannot be guaranteed, warranting a final assessment of **False**.
