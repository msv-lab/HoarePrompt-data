Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program successfully implements the required function of converting degrees to radians using the correct mathematical formula. The annotations support this assessment, confirming that the function operates on a numeric value representing degrees and performs the conversion correctly by multiplying the input by \(\pi/180\). While the annotations note that the function does not handle potential edge cases, it is stated that valid inputs will be assumed, which aligns with the problem description. As such, the function meets the requirements set forth, and there are no inconsistencies between the program, the annotations, and the original assessment regarding correctness.
