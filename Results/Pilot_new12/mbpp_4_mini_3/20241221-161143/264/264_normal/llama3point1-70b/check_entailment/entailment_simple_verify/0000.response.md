Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians using the appropriate formula. The annotations support this conclusion, as they clearly state that the input `deg` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees, and the function returns the angle in radians obtained through the calculation. The original assessment identified that the program works accurately for all valid input scenarios, which aligns with the problem description and the behavior confirmed by the annotations. Thus, I maintain that the original assessment is accurate.
