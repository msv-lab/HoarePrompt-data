Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This conversion is accurate for all input values of degrees, including positive, negative, and zero. No input values lead to incorrect outputs based on the problem description. Thus, I cannot identify any cases where the program does not work as expected.
