Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the formula for converting degrees to radians as stated in the problem description. The annotated version confirms that right before the function call, the input `deg` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. The function then accurately computes the radians by multiplying `deg` with Ï€/180, as per mathematical convention. Since all states and behaviors are consistent with the expected outcomes and there are no edge cases identified that affect the functionality, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the program's correctness holds true.
