To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description (to sort a list of elements), we need to examine the implementation of the function `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Sorting Logic**: The program attempts to sort the array by repeatedly locating the maximum element in the unsorted portion and then reversing the order of elements to place the maximum at its proper location. This technique resembles a selection sort variant.
2. **Key Operations**:
   - It finds the index of the maximum in the unsorted portion of the array.
   - If the maximum is not at its final position (the end of the unsorted portion), the program reverses the segment of the array from `0` to `max_index` to bring the maximum to the front and then reverses the entire unsorted portion to place it at the end.

### Potential Cases to Consider:
1. **Already Sorted List**: If we input a list that is already sorted, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output should still be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. 
2. **Reversed List**: If we input a list that is sorted in reverse, e.g., `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, the function should correctly sort it to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
3. **Single Element List**: An input of a single element, e.g., `[42]`, should return the same list `[42]` since it is already sorted.
4. **List with Duplicates**: An input like `[3, 1, 2, 2, 4]` should yield `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` after sorting.

### Testing a Potential Case:
Let's pick an input case that may expose a flaw in the sorting logic: 
- An example list: `[3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3]`.

#### Expected Behavior:
- The sorted version of this list should be `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`.

#### Actual Behavior:
1. In the first pass, it will find the maximum (4) and move it to the end.
2. In the second pass, it will find the next maximum (3) but may not account for other occurrences correctly, resulting in the potential mishandling of duplicates.

### Conclusion:
Given that the function aims to perform sorting but does not seem to correctly handle duplicate values (as observed when using the test case `[3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3]`), we see it does not maintain a stable sort. Therefore, the output can be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
