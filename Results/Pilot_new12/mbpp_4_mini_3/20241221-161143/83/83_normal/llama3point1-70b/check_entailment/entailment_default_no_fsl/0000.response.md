Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` is intended to sort a list of elements in ascending order. However, it does not handle cases where the input list is `None` or contains non-comparable types, which could lead to exceptions during execution. Additionally, the output hints specify that if the input list is already sorted or contains identical elements, the function will still return the input list unchanged. Although this behavior could be acceptable, it does not align with the expected functionality of a sorting algorithm, which is to sort the list regardless of its initial state.

An example where the code does not work correctly is when given a list of mixed types, such as `[3, 'a', 2]`. The program would throw a `TypeError` during execution since Python cannot compare different data types. Hence, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
