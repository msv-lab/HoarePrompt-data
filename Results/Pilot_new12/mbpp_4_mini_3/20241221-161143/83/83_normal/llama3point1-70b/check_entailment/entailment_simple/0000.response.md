Correctness: **True**

The provided program implements a sorting algorithm that successfully sorts a list of elements in ascending order. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` as input, which aligns with the problem requirement of sorting a list of elements.

2. **Sorting Logic**: 
   - The program uses a sorting technique that involves repeated reversal of segments of the list. This is analogous to selection sort, where in each iteration the maximum element is found and moved to its correct position by reversing the list segments.
   - The outer loop iterates from the length of the list down to 1, ensuring that all elements are examined and sorted.
   - The inner logic correctly identifies the index of the maximum element and reverses segments accordingly to place the maximum at the correct position.

3. **Correct Output**: 
   - After the loop completes, the list `arr` is a sorted list in ascending order, as stated in the comments. The function then returns this sorted list.

In summary, every aspect of the code adheres to the requirements of the problem description, ensuring the function correctly sorts any valid list input. Therefore, the program is correct.
