Correctness: **False**.

The provided sorting function `func_1` has issues that can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the input list `[3, 2, 1]`. The function will not produce the correctly sorted list `[1, 2, 3]`. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial value of `size` is 3. The maximum value in the entire array `[3, 2, 1]` is found at index 0.
2. The function then reverses the first `max_index + 1` elements, turning the array into `[3, 2, 1]` (which is unchanged).
3. It then reverses the first `size` elements resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct for this specific case.
4. If we take another case, for input `[1, 3, 2]`, the maximum index will be 1, which will result in incorrect steps of reversals, yielding an incorrect sorted array.

Thus, there are cases where the function does not sort the array correctly, which indicates the program does not fulfill the problem description of sorting a list of elements correctly.
