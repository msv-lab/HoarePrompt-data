`arr[:size]` gets assigned the reversed version of itself, meaning that the first `size` elements of `arr` are now reversed. Given that `size` is `n - 1`, this indicates that the first `n - 1` elements of `arr` have been reversed. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` contains the reversed first `n - 1` elements; `n` is greater than 0; `size` is `n - 1`; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` within the first `size` elements.**
