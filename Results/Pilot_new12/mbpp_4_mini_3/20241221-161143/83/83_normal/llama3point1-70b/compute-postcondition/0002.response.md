To analyze the code, we need to look at the changes it makes to the variables based on the initial state.

1. `max(arr[:size])` calculates the maximum value of the first `size` elements in `arr`. 
2. `arr.index(...)` finds the index of this maximum value within `arr`.

Given that `size` is equal to `n` and `n` is greater than 0, we know that `size` must also be greater than 0, and thus `arr[:size]` represents a non-empty list.

We will update the state based on these changes while retaining the relevant information about the initial state of the variables.

The new variable `max_index` now holds the index of the maximum value from the first `size` elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`.**
