Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`. The current value of `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1, and the current value of `max_index` is not equal to 0.***
