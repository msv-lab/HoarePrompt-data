To analyze the final output state of the program after the loop completes its iterations, we observe that the loop is designed to sort the elements of the array `arr` in ascending order using a series of reversals based on the index of the maximum element found during each iteration.

Considering the behavior of the loop:

- The loop iterates from `size = n` down to `1`. This means the loop will execute exactly `n` times if `n` is greater than `0`.
- On each iteration, the loop finds the maximum element in the first `size` elements, and if this maximum element is not the last in that range, it may be reversed to bring it to the end of the current sorted range.
- As the loop progresses, the size reduces, and eventually, the entire array `arr` will be sorted as a result.

After all iterations of the loop:
- If `n` is `0`, the loop cannot execute, and `arr` remains unchanged (which is an empty list).
- If `n` is greater than `0`, by the end of the `n` iterations, `arr` will be sorted in ascending order.

Taking these points into account, we can summarize the final output state.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is the length of the original list (non-negative integer).**
