Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are reversed; otherwise, no changes occur in the array.***
