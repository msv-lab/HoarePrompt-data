The code reverses a specific slice of the array `arr`, specifically the first `max_index + 1` elements. The states of the other variables (`size` and `max_index`) remain unaffected. The output state will therefore reflect this change in the array.

Output State: **`arr` contains the reversed first `max_index + 1` elements; `size` is `n - 2`; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value found in the first `n - 2` elements of `arr`.**
