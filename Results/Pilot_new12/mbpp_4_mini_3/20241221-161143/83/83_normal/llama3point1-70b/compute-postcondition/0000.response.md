`n` is assigned the value of `len(arr)`, which represents the number of elements in the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, the length of this list is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `n` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other; `n` is the integer representing the length of `arr`.**
