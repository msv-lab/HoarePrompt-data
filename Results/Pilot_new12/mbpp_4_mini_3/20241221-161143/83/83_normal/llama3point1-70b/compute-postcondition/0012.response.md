Postcondition: ***`arr` is the reversed list of the first `n - 1` elements, and if `max_index` is not equal to 0, the elements from index 0 to `max_index` in `arr` are reversed; `n` is greater than 0; `size` is `n - 1`; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` within the first `size` elements.***
