According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate starting from `n` down to 1. For this loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, during the first iteration, `size` will be initialized to `n`. 

Since `arr` is mentioned but not directly related to the loop execution, we don't need to adjust or check any properties of it as long as `n` is properly set. Therefore, the necessary states to ensure the loop executes are that `n` must be greater than 0 and `size` will be initialized to `n` for the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
