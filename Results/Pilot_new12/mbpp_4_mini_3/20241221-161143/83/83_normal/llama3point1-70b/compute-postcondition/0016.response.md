The statement `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` does the following:

1. It evaluates `arr[:size]`, which gives a slice of the array `arr` from the beginning up to, but not including, the index equal to `size` (which is `n - 2`). Therefore, this slice includes the first `n - 2` elements of the reversed array.
2. The `max(arr[:size])` function finds the maximum value in that sliced portion of the array.
3. The `arr.index(...)` function then finds the index of that maximum value within the entire array `arr`.

The previous values indicate that `arr` contains the reversed first `n - 1` elements, and `size` is `n - 2`. 

Thus, after executing the code, the variable `max_index` is assigned the index of the maximum value found in `arr[:size]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` contains the reversed first `n - 1` elements; `size` is `n - 2`; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value found in the first `n - 2` elements of `arr`.**
