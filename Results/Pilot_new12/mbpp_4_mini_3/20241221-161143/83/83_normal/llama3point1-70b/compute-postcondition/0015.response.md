According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `size`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `size` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, the `size` is `n - 1`, which implies it is positive since `n` is greater than 0. 

In the next iteration, the `size` will be decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `size` will need to be `n - 2`, which should still be greater than or equal to 0. 

State: **`arr` contains the reversed first `n - 1` elements, where `n` is greater than 0, and `size` is `n - 2`**.
