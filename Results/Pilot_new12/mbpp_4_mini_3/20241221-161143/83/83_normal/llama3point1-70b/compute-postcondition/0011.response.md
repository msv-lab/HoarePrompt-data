The code takes the list `arr` and reverses a slice of it from the start up to `max_index + 1`. The variables not directly affected by this operation remain the same. Since `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` within the first `size` elements (which is `n - 1`), this means that the slice being reversed includes elements from the start of `arr` up to the position of this maximum value.

Therefore, the impact of the code is that the portion of `arr` from the start to `max_index` will be reversed, while `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is modified such that the elements from index 0 to `max_index` are reversed; `n` is greater than 0; `size` is `n - 1`; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` within the first `size` elements.**
