In the given code snippet, `arr[:max_index + 1]` represents a slice of the list `arr` from the start up to and including the index `max_index`. The operation `[::-1]` reverses this slice. Therefore, the code modifies the first `max_index + 1` elements of the list `arr`.

The variable `arr` is updated to have its first `max_index + 1` elements reversed. However, the sizes of `n` and `size` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the operation. Likewise, `max_index` still holds its previous value, but the elements of `arr` that it points to are now in reverse order.

Considering these facts, the `max_index` remains unchanged, but the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are updated.

Output State: **`arr` is updated with the first `max_index + 1` elements reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first `size` elements of `arr`, where `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` and is not equal to 0.**
