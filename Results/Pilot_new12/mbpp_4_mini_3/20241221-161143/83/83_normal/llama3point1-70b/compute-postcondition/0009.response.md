According to the code and the given states, the loop execution is dependent on the variable `size`. The loop will continue as long as `size` is greater than 0, which is determined by the range defined in the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `size` is `n` (the starting value of the range), which means the first execution has `size` equal to `n`. In each iteration, `size` is decremented by 1. Thus, for the next iteration to execute, `size` will need to be `n - 1`.

Furthermore, `arr` will either be reversed or remain unchanged based on the value of `max_index`, but since `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` and could potentially affect the state, we specify what `arr` looks like based on whether `max_index` is 0 or not.

For the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be decremented to `n - 1`. Therefore, if `max_index` is not 0, then `arr` would be a reversed list of the first `size` elements, which now corresponds to the first `n - 1` elements.

State: **`arr` is the reversed list of the first `n - 1` elements, `n` is greater than 0, and `size` is `n - 1`**
