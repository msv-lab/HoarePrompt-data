The value of `max_index` is assigned to `i`, which is currently 2. The previous value of `max_index` was 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_index` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of comparable elements. 

Output State: **`max_index` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of comparable elements**.
