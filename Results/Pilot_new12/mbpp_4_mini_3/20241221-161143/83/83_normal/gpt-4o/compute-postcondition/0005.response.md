According to the provided code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and goes until `i < n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will increase by 1, so `i` will become 2. Additionally, `n` must remain greater than 2 in order to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`max_index` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of comparable elements**.
