The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of elements of any type and value. If the length of `arr` (denoted as 'n') is less than 2, the function returns the unchanged sorted list `arr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and, if the list has fewer than 2 elements, return the list unchanged. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of elements of any type and value, and returns the unchanged list if the length of arr is less than 2.**
