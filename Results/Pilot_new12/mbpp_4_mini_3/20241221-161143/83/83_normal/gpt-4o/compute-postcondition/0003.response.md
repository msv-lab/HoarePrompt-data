The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_index`. Since it is given that `i` is currently 1 and `max_index` was initially 0, the value of `max_index` will be updated to 1. The other variables, including `n`, `arr`, and `i`, remain unchanged. 

Given that the current value of `arr[i]` (i.e., `arr[1]`) is greater than `arr[max_index]` (i.e., `arr[0]`), the condition for updating `max_index` has been satisfied.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1.**
