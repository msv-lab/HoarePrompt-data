The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 3. Therefore, the previous value of `max_index` which was 1 will now change to 3. No other variables from the initial state are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`max_index` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `arr` is a list of comparable elements.**
