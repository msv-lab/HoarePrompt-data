Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `end`, which represents the index of the last element in a presumed global list `arr` to be flipped. It flips the elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `end` in place. After execution, if `end` is greater than or equal to 0, the elements from index 0 to index `end` will be reversed. If `end` is 0, the function will effectively leave the list unchanged as it only flips a single element. If `end` is negative (though the function expects it to be non-negative as per the description), it could lead to unexpected behavior or an infinite loop, as the loop condition `start < end` would not hold. At the end of the function, `start` will equal `end + 1`, and `end` will become 0. The function does not handle the case where the `arr` may not be defined globally or may be empty, so it assumes the presence and adequacy of `arr` without validation.**
