The function `find_max_index` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `arr`, which contains comparable elements. The function returns `max_index`, which is the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`. If `n` is 1, the function returns `max_index` as 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `find_max_index` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `arr`, and return the index of the maximum element in the list while handling the case where the list contains only one element. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, a positive integer, and `arr`, a list of comparable elements, returning the index of the maximum element in `arr`, or 0 if `n` is 1.**
