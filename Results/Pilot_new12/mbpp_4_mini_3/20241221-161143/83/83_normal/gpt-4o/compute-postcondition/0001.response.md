According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 because the range function starts at 1 and ends before `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `max_index` is initialized to 0, we also consider the role of `i`. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure:
1. `n` must be greater than 1 to allow for at least one iteration.
2. At the start of the loop, `i` will be 1 during the first iteration.

Thus, the adjustments are as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**
