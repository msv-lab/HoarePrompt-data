Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of elements of any type and value. It sorts the list in-place if the length of `arr` is 2 or more. If the length of `arr` is less than 2, the list remains unchanged. After execution, the function returns the modified (or unchanged) list `arr`, which will be sorted if it contained 2 or more elements. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is not a list or contains non-comparable elements, which could lead to runtime exceptions.**
