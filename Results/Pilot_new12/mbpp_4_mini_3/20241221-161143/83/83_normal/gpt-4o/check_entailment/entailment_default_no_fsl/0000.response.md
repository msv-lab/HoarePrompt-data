Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the hints. While the sorting function `func_1` intends to sort a list, it relies on global variables (`arr`) within its associated functions (`flip` and `find_max_index`), which is considered poor practice and can lead to unexpected behavior if `arr` is not defined globally. Moreover, `func_1` does not explicitly handle cases where the input list is empty or less than 2, even though the description mentions that it will leave such lists unchanged. 

Additionally, the `find_max_index` function lacks the proper handling for an empty list, leading to undefined behavior when called with a list of length 0, which could result in errors. Since the program does not guarantee correct behavior across all described scenarios, it cannot be considered correct overall.
