You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Functions with output description for each function:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(arr):


    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of elements of any type and value. It sorts the list in-place if the length of `arr` is 2 or more. If the length of `arr` is less than 2, the list remains unchanged. After execution, the function returns the modified (or unchanged) list `arr`, which will be sorted if it contained 2 or more elements. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is not a list or contains non-comparable elements, which could lead to runtime exceptions.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `end`, which represents the index of the last element in a presumed global list `arr` to be flipped. It flips the elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `end` in place. After execution, if `end` is greater than or equal to 0, the elements from index 0 to index `end` will be reversed. If `end` is 0, the function will effectively leave the list unchanged as it only flips a single element. If `end` is negative (though the function expects it to be non-negative as per the description), it could lead to unexpected behavior or an infinite loop, as the loop condition `start < end` would not hold. At the end of the function, `start` will equal `end + 1`, and `end` will become 0. The function does not handle the case where the `arr` may not be defined globally or may be empty, so it assumes the presence and adequacy of `arr` without validation.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts a positive integer parameter `n`, which represents the number of elements in a list, and is intended to return the index of the maximum element in a global list `arr`. However, the function is incomplete because it lacks the parameter `arr`, meaning that it will not work as intended unless `arr` is defined globally. If `n` is 1, the function directly returns 0 without entering the loop. If `n` is greater than 1, the function iterates through the elements of `arr` starting from index 1, comparing each element to the current maximum value found at `arr[max_index]`. The index of the maximum element is updated accordingly. After the execution of the function, it will return the index of the maximum element found in `arr`, which could potentially lead to an error if `arr` is not defined. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is empty or `n` is zero, which would lead to undefined behavior. In summary, the function attempts to find and return the index of the maximum element in `arr`, with an undefined state in cases where `arr` is not provided or if its length is not in line with `n`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
