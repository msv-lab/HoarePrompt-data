You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and value.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of elements, `n` is the original length of `arr`, and the final `curr_size` is 1. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is less than 2), then `arr` remains unchanged.
    return arr
    #The program returns the unchanged sorted list 'arr' since 'n' is less than 2.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer that is greater than or equal to zero and represents the index of the last element in the list to be flipped; start is implied to be a non-negative integer initialized to zero, serving as the index of the first element in the list to be flipped.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to the original value of `end`, `end` is equal to the original value of `end` minus the original value of `end` (which may result in 0), and the elements of `arr` have been swapped from index 0 to index (original `end`), reflecting the changes made during the iterations of the loop.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list, and arr is a list of comparable elements.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list, `arr` is a list of comparable elements. If `n` is 1, then `max_index` remains 0, and the loop does not execute.
    return max_index
    #The program returns max_index, which is the index of the maximum element in arr, and if n is 1, max_index remains 0.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
