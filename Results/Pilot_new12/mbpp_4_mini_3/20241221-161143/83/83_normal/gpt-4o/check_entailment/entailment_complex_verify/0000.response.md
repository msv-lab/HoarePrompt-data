The original assessment identifies a significant issue with the program: the use of a global variable `arr` in `find_max_index`, which is not passed as an argument to the function. This leads to potential errors when executing the code, as `arr` must be defined in the global scope for the function to work correctly. Additionally, there are concerns regarding the logic of the sorting algorithm and the handling of input lists that could contain non-comparable elements.

The annotations indicate that these issues remain unresolved. They reiterate that `func_1` expects to operate on a list named `arr`, which must be defined globally, yet this does not provide evidence that the program meets the problem description of sorting a list correctly. Even though the program may theoretically sort a valid input list, its reliance on a global variable prevents it from functioning properly due to the risk of a `NameError`. 

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not meet the expectations set out in the problem description because it is not able to execute without throwing an error under typical usage. 

Final: **False**
