Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The code does not meet the problem description of sorting a list of elements correctly. The problem hints suggest that the function should sort a list in-place, but the function `func_1` relies on three other functions (`flip`, `find_max_index`, and a non-existent global variable `arr`), which could lead to runtime errors. Specifically, `find_max_index` assumes that `arr` exists globally, which is not guaranteed. Additionally, the `flip` function has limitations as it also assumes global access to `arr`, and does not handle cases where it might be empty or not defined. 

Moreover, the `arr` variable is not passed into the helper functions, which breaks modularity and leads to unclear behavior. A significant problem here is that if `arr` is empty or the sorting logic is not applied appropriately, the function may not sort the list as expected. Therefore, due to these issues, the code can not be deemed correct as it does not guarantee proper sorting in all cases.
