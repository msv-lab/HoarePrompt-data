You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Annotated Functions:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and value.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of elements, `n` is the original length of `arr`, and the final `curr_size` is 1. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is less than 2), then `arr` remains unchanged.
    return arr
    #The program returns the unchanged sorted list 'arr' since 'n' is less than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of elements of any type and value. It sorts the list in-place if the length of `arr` is 2 or more. If the length of `arr` is less than 2, the list remains unchanged. After execution, the function returns the modified (or unchanged) list `arr`, which will be sorted if it contained 2 or more elements. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is not a list or contains non-comparable elements, which could lead to runtime exceptions.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer that is greater than or equal to zero and represents the index of the last element in the list to be flipped; start is implied to be a non-negative integer initialized to zero, serving as the index of the first element in the list to be flipped.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to the original value of `end`, `end` is equal to the original value of `end` minus the original value of `end` (which may result in 0), and the elements of `arr` have been swapped from index 0 to index (original `end`), reflecting the changes made during the iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `end`, which represents the index of the last element in a presumed global list `arr` to be flipped. It flips the elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `end` in place. After execution, if `end` is greater than or equal to 0, the elements from index 0 to index `end` will be reversed. If `end` is 0, the function will effectively leave the list unchanged as it only flips a single element. If `end` is negative (though the function expects it to be non-negative as per the description), it could lead to unexpected behavior or an infinite loop, as the loop condition `start < end` would not hold. At the end of the function, `start` will equal `end + 1`, and `end` will become 0. The function does not handle the case where the `arr` may not be defined globally or may be empty, so it assumes the presence and adequacy of `arr` without validation.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list, and arr is a list of comparable elements.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list, `arr` is a list of comparable elements. If `n` is 1, then `max_index` remains 0, and the loop does not execute.
    return max_index
    #The program returns max_index, which is the index of the maximum element in arr, and if n is 1, max_index remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer parameter `n`, which represents the number of elements in a list, and is intended to return the index of the maximum element in a global list `arr`. However, the function is incomplete because it lacks the parameter `arr`, meaning that it will not work as intended unless `arr` is defined globally. If `n` is 1, the function directly returns 0 without entering the loop. If `n` is greater than 1, the function iterates through the elements of `arr` starting from index 1, comparing each element to the current maximum value found at `arr[max_index]`. The index of the maximum element is updated accordingly. After the execution of the function, it will return the index of the maximum element found in `arr`, which could potentially lead to an error if `arr` is not defined. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is empty or `n` is zero, which would lead to undefined behavior. In summary, the function attempts to find and return the index of the maximum element in `arr`, with an undefined state in cases where `arr` is not provided or if its length is not in line with `n`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
