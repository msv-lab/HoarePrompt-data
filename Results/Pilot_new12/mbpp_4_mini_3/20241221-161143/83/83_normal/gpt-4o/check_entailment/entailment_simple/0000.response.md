The provided Python program aims to sort a list of elements, as stated in the problem description. Let's analyze the key components of the program to see if it adheres to the requirement of sorting:

1. **Function Functionality**:
   - The `func_1` function is responsible for sorting the list. It uses two auxiliary functions: `find_max_index` to locate the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list and `flip` to reverse the order of elements in the list.
   - The logic of the `func_1` function attempts to sort the array by repeatedly finding the maximum element and flipping it to its correct position.

2. **Correctness of Sorting Logic**:
   - The `find_max_index` function looks through the list to find the maximum value's index correctly. However, it relies on a global variable `arr`, which is not passed as a parameter. This could lead to incorrect behavior when used in a different context or if the code is refactored.
   - The `flip` function also manipulates `arr` in place. Therefore, it expects `arr` to be defined globally, which is not a best practice in programming.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty or contains one element, the current implementation does not explicitly handle these conditions but relies on the loop design. However, it implicitly works as the outer loop would not execute if `n` is less than 2, leaving the list unchanged (which is correct).

4. **Testing Assertions**:
   - The function is validated against several test cases, all of which pass if we assume that `arr` has appropriate values during execution.

In conclusion, while the logic intends to sort the list correctly, the reliance on a non-local variable (`arr` should be a parameter) raises concerns about the function's robustness and adherence to good coding practices. Furthermore, this dependency can lead to issues if the function is tested in contexts different from what is assumed here.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement of being correct due to its use of global variable access, which can lead to unwanted behaviors or errors in a different context.

Correctness: **False**
