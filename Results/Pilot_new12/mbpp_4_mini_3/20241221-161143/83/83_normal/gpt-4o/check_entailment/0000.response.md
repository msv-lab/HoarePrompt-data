To determine the correctness of the provided program for sorting a list of elements, let's analyze the code step by step.

The sorting algorithm implemented appears to be a variant of the pancake sorting algorithm. Here's a brief overview of the issues found in the code:

1. **Global Variables**: The `find_max_index` function uses a variable `arr`, which is expected to be defined globally, but is never passed as an argument nor declared globally. If `arr` is not defined outside of these functions, this will lead to an error when executing the code.

2. **Logic of the Sorting Algorithm**: The core idea behind the sorting is to find the maximum element in the remaining unsorted array and move it to its correct position using flips. However, without properly handling the state of `arr`, the function will not function correctly. Flipping operations are intended to sort elements but rely on the proper definition and handling of `arr`.

3. **Flipping Logic**: Additionally, if `arr` contains different types of elements or is empty, the function may not provide the intended output or could generate errors.

Based on the identified issues, particularly regarding the undeclared variable `arr`, we have the following explicit counter-example:

- When the function is called with an input list, for example: `func_1([3, 2, 5])`, since `arr` is not defined in the local or global scope, a `NameError` will occur.

Thus, the program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of sorting a list of elements because it will fail to execute properly due to the absence of the `arr` definition in the necessary context.

Correctness: **False**.
