The original assessment states that the program is incorrect, and this aligns with the issues highlighted in both the original assessment and the annotated version of the code. 

1. **Scope of `arr`**: The function `find_max_index` does not receive `arr` as an argument, leading to the risk of a `NameError` due to `arr` being undefined within its scope. This is a critical error in the implementation, as it prevents the function from working correctly.

2. **Return Statement**: In the function `func_1`, if `arr` is not defined properly or if it is empty, it fails to return a valid list. Specifically, the lack of handling for the edge case of an empty list means that it does not fulfill the sorting requirement for all scenarios as stated in the problem description.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: Although the assessment mentions that it does not handle edge cases, this remains a pertinent factor in assessing correctness. The program's failure to account for edge cases like an empty list means that it doesn't robustly meet the problem requirements.

4. **Global `arr` Dependency**: The reliance on assuming `arr` will be globally defined is problematic. This means that unless `arr` is explicitly defined outside of `func_1`, the program would not run successfully.

Consequently, after reviewing the annotated version, which confirms these issues, the reasoning behind the original assessment remains sound. Therefore, the original conclusion about the program's correctness, which states that the program is incorrect, is justified.

Final: **False**
