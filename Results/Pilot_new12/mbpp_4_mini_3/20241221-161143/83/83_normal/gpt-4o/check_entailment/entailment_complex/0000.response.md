Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle edge cases related to the input. Specifically:

1. **Global Variable Dependency**: The functions `flip` and `find_max_index` rely on a global variable `arr` which is not passed as a parameter. This means that if `arr` is not defined globally, the code will fail to work as intended. The lack of proper parameter passing is a significant issue since it violates good coding practices and restricts the reusability of the functions.

2. **Non-Comparable Elements**: The function assumes that all elements in `arr` are comparable. If `arr` contains non-comparable elements (for example, a mix of strings and integers), the program will raise a `TypeError` during execution when trying to compare them. The problem description does not specify any constraints regarding the types of elements that can be sorted.

3. **Empty List Handling**: While the function does not explicitly mention handling for an empty list, the state annotations in both `flip` and `find_max_index` suggest the assumption that `arr` has valid elements, which is not always true. An empty list should be managed properly to ensure that the functions behave as expected.

Due to these issues, particularly the reliance on a global variable and the assumption of comparability among list elements, the program does not satisfy the problem description fully for every potential case.
