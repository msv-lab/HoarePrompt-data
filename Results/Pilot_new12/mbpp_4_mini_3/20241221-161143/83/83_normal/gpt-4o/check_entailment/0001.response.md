Correctness: **False**

The provided code attempts to implement a sorting algorithm using the "pancake sorting" method, but it has several issues:

1. The main function `func_1` achieves sorting using helper functions `flip` and `find_max_index`, but it does not correctly reference the list `arr` in `find_max_index`. The variable `arr` should be passed as a parameter to this function, making it inaccessible in the current context, leading to a `NameError`.

2. There is no return statement for the variable `arr` in the `func_1` if `arr` is not defined within its scope, which will cause the function to fail when it tries to access the array.

3. The lack of a check for an empty list or a list of one element means that it does not handle edge cases correctly. When no elements exist, the array remains unchanged, and this situation should be explicitly addressed.

4. The algorithm could also benefit from functionality that ensures handling duplicates effectively.

As a result of these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirement of sorting the list reliably for all cases. For example, calling `func_1([])` (an empty list) will not behave as intended, nor will input like `func_1([3, 2, 3, 1])` be managed properly due to the unhandled variable scope and output issues. 

Thus, because it doesn't handle certain cases correctly and demonstrates a core functionality failure, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
