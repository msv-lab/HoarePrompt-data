#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and value.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of elements, `n` is the original length of `arr`, and the final `curr_size` is 1. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is less than 2), then `arr` remains unchanged.
    return arr
    #The program returns the unchanged sorted list 'arr' since 'n' is less than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of elements of any type and value. It sorts the list in-place if the length of `arr` is 2 or more. If the length of `arr` is less than 2, the list remains unchanged. After execution, the function returns the modified (or unchanged) list `arr`, which will be sorted if it contained 2 or more elements. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is not a list or contains non-comparable elements, which could lead to runtime exceptions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer that is greater than or equal to zero and represents the index of the last element in the list to be flipped; start is implied to be a non-negative integer initialized to zero, serving as the index of the first element in the list to be flipped.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to the original value of `end`, `end` is equal to the original value of `end` minus the original value of `end` (which may result in 0), and the elements of `arr` have been swapped from index 0 to index (original `end`), reflecting the changes made during the iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `end`, which represents the index of the last element in a presumed global list `arr` to be flipped. It flips the elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `end` in place. After execution, if `end` is greater than or equal to 0, the elements from index 0 to index `end` will be reversed. If `end` is 0, the function will effectively leave the list unchanged as it only flips a single element. If `end` is negative (though the function expects it to be non-negative as per the description), it could lead to unexpected behavior or an infinite loop, as the loop condition `start < end` would not hold. At the end of the function, `start` will equal `end + 1`, and `end` will become 0. The function does not handle the case where the `arr` may not be defined globally or may be empty, so it assumes the presence and adequacy of `arr` without validation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list, and arr is a list of comparable elements.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list, `arr` is a list of comparable elements. If `n` is 1, then `max_index` remains 0, and the loop does not execute.
    return max_index
    #The program returns max_index, which is the index of the maximum element in arr, and if n is 1, max_index remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer parameter `n`, which represents the number of elements in a list, and is intended to return the index of the maximum element in a global list `arr`. However, the function is incomplete because it lacks the parameter `arr`, meaning that it will not work as intended unless `arr` is defined globally. If `n` is 1, the function directly returns 0 without entering the loop. If `n` is greater than 1, the function iterates through the elements of `arr` starting from index 1, comparing each element to the current maximum value found at `arr[max_index]`. The index of the maximum element is updated accordingly. After the execution of the function, it will return the index of the maximum element found in `arr`, which could potentially lead to an error if `arr` is not defined. The function does not handle cases where `arr` is empty or `n` is zero, which would lead to undefined behavior. In summary, the function attempts to find and return the index of the maximum element in `arr`, with an undefined state in cases where `arr` is not provided or if its length is not in line with `n`.
