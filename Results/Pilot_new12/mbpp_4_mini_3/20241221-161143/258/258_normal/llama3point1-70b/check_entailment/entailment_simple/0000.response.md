Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number based on the provided problem description. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

2. **Functionality of the Program**:
   - The function `func_1(num)` takes a non-negative integer as input.
   - It converts the integer to a string to evaluate its digits and computes the length of this string (`num_len`), which represents the number of digits in `num`.
   - A for loop iterates through each digit, converting it back to an integer and raising it to the power of `num_len`, accumulating this result in `sum`.
   - Finally, it checks if this cumulative `sum` equals the original number `num` and returns the result of this comparison.

3. **Handling of Valid Input**: The program specifies that the input `num` must be a non-negative integer and handles it accordingly by raising each digit to the power of the length of the number and comparing it to the original integer.

4. **Return Value**: The return statement correctly evaluates whether the calculated sum equals `num`, thereby confirming whether the number is an Armstrong number.

Overall, the program meets all requirements set out in the problem description and performs the necessary checks for determining if a number is an Armstrong number. Thus, it is deemed correct.
