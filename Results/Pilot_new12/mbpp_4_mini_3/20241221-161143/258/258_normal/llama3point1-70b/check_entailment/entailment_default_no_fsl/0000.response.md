Correctness: **False**

The provided program aims to check whether a number is an Armstrong number or not. However, it has a limitation in handling invalid inputs. Specifically, while the output hints state that the function accepts a non-negative integer, the problem description does not specify that the input will always be valid. 

Moreover, if the input is anything other than a valid non-negative integer (even though the hints assume valid input), the function does not implement any checks or handling for such cases. Since the function assumes all inputs will adhere to the expected format, if a negative number or non-integer is provided, it could lead to incorrect behavior or errors.

For instance:
- Input: -1 (negative integer) would lead to an incorrect behavior because there is no validation in the code to handle negative numbers, which cannot be Armstrong numbers.
- Input: "abc" (string) would also raise an error during execution since it attempts to convert the string to an integer when checking for digit powers.

Since the program does not handle these potential cases and could lead to incorrect outcomes, the correctness is marked as False.
