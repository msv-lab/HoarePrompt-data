Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). 

An Armstrong number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. It converts the number to a string to easily access each digit.
2. It computes the number of digits in the input number.
3. It iterates through each digit, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and sums these values.
4. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number.

The program handles various cases effectively:

- For a single-digit number (e.g., `5`), the result will always be `True`, since any single-digit number raised to the power of `1` is itself.
- For multi-digit numbers, it will correctly calculate whether they fulfill the Armstrong condition.

Examples of successful determinations:
- `153` → \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153 \), returns `True`
- `9474` → \( 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 9474 \), returns `True`
- `123` → \( 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36 \), returns `False`

Since the program implements the required logic correctly for all valid inputs, there is no edge case or input for which it would fail. Thus, it is confirmed to meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
