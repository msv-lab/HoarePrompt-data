Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number, which is correct according to the problem description for valid, non-negative integers. However, the output hints indicate that the function implicitly assumes the input is always a valid, non-negative integer and does not handle invalid inputs or negative values. For example, the function will not return a correct result if a negative number is provided (for instance, `func_1(-153)`), as there's no mechanism to handle or validate such cases, and the assumption of valid input does not guarantee that it will always be the case. Therefore, since the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, it is deemed incorrect.
