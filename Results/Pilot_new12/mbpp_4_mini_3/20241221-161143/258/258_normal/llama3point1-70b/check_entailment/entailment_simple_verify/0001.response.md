Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The annotations confirm that the program correctly computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits and then checks if this sum equals the original number. The program handles all valid cases of non-negative integers as described in the problem statement, effectively verifying the Armstrong condition for both single-digit and multi-digit numbers. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence from both the original assessment and the annotations to conclude that the program meets the requirements for correctness.
