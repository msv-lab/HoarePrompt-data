You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program for checking whether a number is an Armstrong number or not, we can analyze the logic of the code.

The program works by:
1. Converting the input number into a string to enable iteration over each digit.
2. Calculating the number of digits (`num_len`) in the input number.
3. Initializing a variable `sum` to zero.
4. Iterating over each digit, converting it back to an integer, raising it to the power of `num_len`, and adding it to `sum`.
5. Finally, it checks if `sum` is equal to the original number (`num`).

To assess if it is handling all cases correctly:
- An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for `n` digits is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of `n`.

Examples of Armstrong numbers:
- 0, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407 (for 3 digits), and so on.

Examples of non-Armstrong numbers:
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 100, etc.

Now, letâ€™s think of specific test cases and verify if the program works as expected:

1. **Input: 153**
   - Calculation: \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\), which is an Armstrong number. The output should be `True`.
   
2. **Input: 370**
   - Calculation: \(3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 27 + 343 + 0 = 370\), which is an Armstrong number. The output should be `True`.

3. **Input: 371**
   - Calculation: \(3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371\), which is an Armstrong number. The output should be `True`.

4. **Input: 0**
   - Calculation: \(0^1 = 0\), which is an Armstrong number. The output should be `True`.

5. **Input: 2**
   - Calculation: \(2^1 = 2\), which is an Armstrong number. The output should be `True`.

6. **Input: 10**
   - Calculation: \(1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1\), which is not equal to 10. The output should be `False`.

7. **Input: 9474**
   - Calculation: \(9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 7074\), which is not equal to 9474. The output should be `False`.

The provided program covers all the required computation. The logic correctly checks for Armstrong numbers and returns expected results for both Armstrong and non-Armstrong numbers.

After reviewing the conditions and the calculations above:
Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly identifies Armstrong numbers for all potential cases according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and checks whether it is an Armstrong number. It calculates the sum of each digit of `num`, each raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num`. The function returns `True` if this calculated sum is equal to `num`, and `False` otherwise. It is assumed that the input `num` is a valid non-negative integer, but the function does not handle invalid inputs or negative values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
