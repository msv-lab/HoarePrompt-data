Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description for checking whether a number is an Armstrong number. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function performs this calculation by:
   - Converting the number into a string to easily iterate over its digits.
   - Determining the length of this string to know how many digits there are (denoted as `num_len`).
   - Calculating the sum by converting each digit back to an integer, raising it to the power of `num_len`, and accumulating this.

2. **Correct Return Condition**: The function returns `True` if the calculated `sum` (the sum of the digits each raised to the power of their count) is equal to the original number (`num`). If they are not equal, it returns `False`. This directly follows the definition of an Armstrong number.

3. **Assumption of Input Validity**: The program assumes that `num` will always be a non-negative integer, as stated in the comments, and it adheres to that assumption throughout its claims.

There are no cases where the function would produce incorrect outputs based on the problem description since it accurately computes and compares the values in question correctly.

Overall, the implementation aligns perfectly with the problem requirements, hence the correctness evaluation is deemed **True**.
