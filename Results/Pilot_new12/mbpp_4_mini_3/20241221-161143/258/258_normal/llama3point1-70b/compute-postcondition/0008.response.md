`sum` is updated by adding `int(digit) ** num_len` to the existing value of `sum`. The value of `digit` is the second character in `num_str`, which, being a string representation of a non-negative integer of at least 3 characters, has a valid integer value. The state of `num`, `num_str`, and `digit` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State indicates that `sum` has been modified.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least 3 characters, `sum` is equal to the previous value of `sum` plus `int(digit) ** num_len` for the second character in `num_str`, `digit` is the second character in `num_str`**
