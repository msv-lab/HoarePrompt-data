The variable `sum` is initialized to 0. However, the other variables (`num`, `num_str`, and `num_len`) remain unaffected by this initialization. The state of `num` as a non-negative integer, `num_str` as the string representation of `num`, and `num_len` as the length of `num_str` continues to hold true. 

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is 0**
