The code `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of `int(digit) ** num_len` to it. The variable `digit` is the first character of the string representation of `num`, which implies that `digit` is non-negative and its integer conversion will be a non-negative integer as well. Since `num_len` must be at least 1, `int(digit) ** num_len` will always yield a non-negative integer.

The previous value of `sum` is 0, so the new value of `sum` will be equal to `int(digit) ** num_len`.

The states of the other variables, including `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state can be expressed as follows, incorporating the calculated new value of `sum`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` must be at least 1, `sum` is equal to `int(digit) ** num_len`, `digit` is the first character of `num_str`**.
