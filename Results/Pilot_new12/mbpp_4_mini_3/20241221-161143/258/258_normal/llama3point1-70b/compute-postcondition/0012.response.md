Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and checks whether it is an Armstrong number. It calculates the sum of each digit of `num`, each raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num`. The function returns `True` if this calculated sum is equal to `num`, and `False` otherwise. It is assumed that the input `num` is a valid non-negative integer, but the function does not handle invalid inputs or negative values.**
