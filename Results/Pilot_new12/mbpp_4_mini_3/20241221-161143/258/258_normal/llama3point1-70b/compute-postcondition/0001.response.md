`num_len` is assigned the value of `len(num_str)`, which represents the length of the string `num_str`. The variable `num` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect it. Since `num_str` is the string representation of a non-negative integer `num`, `num_len` will be a non-negative integer reflecting the number of digits in `num_str`. Therefore, the Output State includes the previous states of the variables, indicating that `num_len` is equal to the number of characters in `num_str`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.**
