To analyze the program's final state after the loop completes its execution, we consider the initial state provided and the code of the loop.

The loop iterates through each digit of the string representation of the non-negative integer `num`, calculating `sum` as the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`, which is the length of `num_str`. 

To complete the analysis, let's denote `num_str` has `k` digits, where `k` is at least 1 since `num` is a non-negative integer. 

1. After the loop executes `k` times (where `k` is the number of digits in `num_str`), `sum` accumulates the total of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.
2. As such:
   - `sum` will equal to the sum of `int(digit) ** num_len` for each digit in `num_str`.
   - `num_len` is equal to `k`.

If the loop does not execute (when `num` is 0, which implies `num_str` is "0"), then `sum` remains 0, and it is clear that the output state must reflect the case where `num_str` has no digits to process.

Putting all this together:

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `sum` is equal to the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of the length of `num_str`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.**
