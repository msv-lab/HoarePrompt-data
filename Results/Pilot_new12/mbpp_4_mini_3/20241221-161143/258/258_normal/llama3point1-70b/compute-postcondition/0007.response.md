According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `num_str`. Since `num_str` must have at least 2 characters at the end of the last iteration and has not changed during the execution of the loop, we need to ensure that it has at least 3 characters for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, since `num_str` had at least 2 characters, it means the loop processed the first character (i.e., the first digit) and `digit` is currently equal to that first character. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the next iteration should process the second character.

Since `digit` is the character from `num_str` being iterated, after the final execution of the loop, `digit` must be the next character in the sequence. Thus, the loop would need to increment an internal index (implicitly, through the `for` statement) to reach the next character.

So, after executing `digit` for one character, the `digit` will take the second character in the next iteration.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least 3 characters, `sum` is equal to `int(digit) + int(digit)` for the second character in `num_str`, `digit` is the second character in `num_str`**
