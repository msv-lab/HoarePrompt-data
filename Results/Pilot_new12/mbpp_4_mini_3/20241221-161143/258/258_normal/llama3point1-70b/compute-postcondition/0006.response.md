To analyze the given code, we note the following impacts and relationships among the variables:

1. `sum` is initially equal to `int(digit)`.
2. The code modifies `sum` by adding `int(digit) ** num_len` to it. This means the value of `sum` will be updated based on this calculation:
   - `int(digit)` is the integer value of the variable `digit`.
   - `num_len` is assumed to be the length of `num_str`.

Thus, after executing the code, the new value of `sum` will be:
- `sum = int(digit) + int(digit) ** num_len`

Since `num` is a non-negative integer and `num_str` has at least 2 characters, the required conditions remain valid. However, the value of `sum` changes.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least 2 characters, `sum` is equal to `int(digit) + int(digit) ** num_len`**
