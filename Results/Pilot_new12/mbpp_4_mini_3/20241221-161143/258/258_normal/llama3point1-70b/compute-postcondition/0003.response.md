According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `num_str`. For the loop to execute, `num_str` must not be empty. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, if `num` is 0, then `num_str` will be "0", which is a valid string with one character. However, if `num` is any positive integer, then `num_str` will have a positive length corresponding to the number of digits in `num`. 

Since `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The loop will start with `digit` as the first character of `num_str` which will be a string representation of the first digit of `num`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute are:
1. `num_str` must not be empty (which it won't be if `num` is non-negative).
2. At the start of the loop, `digit` should represent the first character in `num_str`.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` must be at least 1, `sum` is 0, `digit` is the first character of `num_str`**.
