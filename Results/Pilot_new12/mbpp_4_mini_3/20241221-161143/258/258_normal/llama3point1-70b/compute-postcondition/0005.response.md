According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `num_str`, which represents the digits of the non-negative integer `num`. The loop will execute again for the next digit as long as there are remaining characters in `num_str`.

At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` has been partially processed, and `num_len` must be adjusted to account for the next digit. If `num_len` is at least 1, it indicates that there is at least one digit present. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `num_len` must be at least 2, indicating that there are still digits left.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` that must have at least 2 characters, `sum` is equal to `int(digit)`**
