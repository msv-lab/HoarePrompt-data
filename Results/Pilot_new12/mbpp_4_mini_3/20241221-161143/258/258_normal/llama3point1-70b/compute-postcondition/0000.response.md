The code assigns `num_str` the string representation of `num`. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` will be the string equivalent of that integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`**
