Final: **True**

The program accurately implements the functionality necessary to determine whether a given number is an Armstrong number, as required by the problem description. The annotated version of the code confirms the correctness of the program at various stages.

1. **Input Handling**: The annotation clearly states that `n` is expected to be a non-negative integer, which aligns with the requirements. 
2. **Conversion and Calculation**: The conversion of `n` to its string representation (`num_str`) and the subsequent calculation of the length (`num_len`) to determine the number of digits serves the program's purpose well.
3. **Armstrong Sum Calculation**: The use of a generator inside the `sum()` function to compute the Armstrong sum is both efficient and correct.
4. **Return Value Check**: The program's return statement checks if this sum is equal to the original number, thus fulfilling the definition of an Armstrong number.

The annotations provided reinforce the accuracy of each step, including the final equality check verifying if the computed sum matches `n`. 

Given that the program passed all assertions and the original assessment was based on sound reasoning, the final assessment stands as **True**.
