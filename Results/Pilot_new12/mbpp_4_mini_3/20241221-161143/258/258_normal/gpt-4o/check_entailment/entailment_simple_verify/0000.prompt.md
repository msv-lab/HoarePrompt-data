You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the program code and the case for checking if a number is an Armstrong number.

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a number with `n` digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of `n`. For example:
- 153 is an Armstrong number because \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 \).
- 259 is not, since \( 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 2 + 125 + 729 = 856 \).
- 4458 is also not an Armstrong number because \( 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 = 5127 \).

Now, let's closely inspect the given code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n
```

### Analysis
1. **Functionality**: 
   - The function converts the number to a string to iterate over its digits.
   - It calculates `num_len`, the number of digits.
   - It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` and checks if this sum equals the original number.

2. **Test Cases**: 
   - Three assertions provided are:
     - `func_1(153) == True` (correct)
     - `func_1(259) == False` (correct)
     - `func_1(4458) == False` (correct)

### Potential Issue
However, the condition to handle inputs less than 0 has not been provided:
- **Negative Numbers**: Negative numbers cannot be Armstrong numbers by the mathematical definition, but the function does not explicitly handle these. For example, calling `func_1(-1)` would return `False`, which is not what we might expect if we consider negative numbers in terms of their absolute value or lack of definition in this context.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not explicitly define what happens for negatives or potentially other boundary cases like single digit numbers (which are always Armstrong numbers), we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation**: While the code works correctly for positive integers based on the given assertions, it does not handle negative inputs (e.g., `func_1(-1)`), which is an edge case the description does not account for, hence leading to undefined behavior regarding the Armstrong property.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
    return armstrong_sum == n
    #The program returns whether the sum of each digit of n raised to the power of the number of digits in n is equal to n.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
