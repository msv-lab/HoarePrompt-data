Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. 

Hereâ€™s an explanation of the correctness:

1. **Definition of an Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number of order `n` is an integer such that the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of `n` is equal to the number itself. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
   - It converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit.
   - It calculates the length of the number (which serves as `n` in the Armstrong condition).
   - It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits using a generator expression.
   - Finally, it checks if this computed sum is equal to the original number `n` and returns the result.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test the function with known values:
   - `func_1(153)` returns `True` as 153 is an Armstrong number.
   - `func_1(259)` returns `False` since it is not an Armstrong number.
   - `func_1(4458)` also returns `False` as it is not an Armstrong number.

Since the function meets all the requirements as specified in the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct. Therefore, we print "True".
