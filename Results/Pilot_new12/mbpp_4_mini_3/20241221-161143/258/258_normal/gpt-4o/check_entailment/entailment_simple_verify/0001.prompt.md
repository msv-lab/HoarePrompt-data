You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly defines a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a Narcissistic number) is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here is the breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Conversion**: The number `n` is converted to a string to facilitate the digit extraction.
2. **Length Calculation**: The length of this string representation (`num_len`) gives the number of digits in the number.
3. **Armstrong Sum Calculation**: The sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` is calculated using a generator expression within the `sum()` function.
4. **Comparison**: Finally, the calculated sum is checked to see if it is equal to the original number `n`.

The example assertions provided in the program also cover common test cases:
- `153` is an Armstrong number (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153).
- `259` is not (2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 2 + 125 + 729 = 856).
- `4458` is not (4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 = 4333).

Testing for various numbers including single-digit numbers (which are always Armstrong numbers) will consistently return correct results. Therefore, I could not find any case where the function fails to correctly identify Armstrong numbers.

Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem description comprehensively.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
    return armstrong_sum == n
    #The program returns whether the sum of each digit of n raised to the power of the number of digits in n is equal to n.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
