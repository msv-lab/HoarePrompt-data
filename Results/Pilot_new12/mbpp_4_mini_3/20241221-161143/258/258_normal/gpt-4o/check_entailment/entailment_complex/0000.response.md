Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: The program correctly defines an Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, for the number 153, it has 3 digits, and \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\).

2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1(n)` performs the following steps:
   - Converts the number `n` into a string to easily iterate over each digit.
   - Calculates how many digits `n` has by determining the length of this string (stored in `num_len`).
   - Computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`.
   - Finally, it checks if this computed sum equals `n` and returns a boolean result.

3. **Handling of Input**: The function is designed to work under the assumption provided that `n` is a non-negative integer. It does not need to handle cases of negative integers or non-integers as per the stated assumptions.

4. **Test assertions**: The assert statements that follow the function definition cover several test cases:
   - `func_1(153)` correctly evaluates to `True`.
   - `func_1(259)` and `func_1(4458)` correctly evaluate to `False`.
   
Since the program implements all the necessary logic to determine whether the number is an Armstrong number and adheres to the assumptions about the input, it fulfills the criteria outlined in the problem description.

Thus, the correct response is that the program is correct.
