Based on the reasoning provided in the original assessment, the program correctly identifies Armstrong numbers for the provided test cases: it returns `True` for `153`, and `False` for both `259` and `4458`. The program effectively implements the logic for checking whether a number is an Armstrong number according to the mathematical definition.

The annotated version of the code also confirms this correctness, stating that the state of the program before the function call is that `n` is a non-negative integer. This aligns with the assumption that the input is valid, as per the instructions.

Furthermore, the concern regarding the handling of negative numbers does not directly affect the correctness of the function for the specified test cases. Since the program expects a non-negative integer and the problem description does not specify behavior for negative numbers, we can deem the program's correctness for the defined inputs as valid.

Since the original assessment accurately reflects that the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and the annotations throughout the code affirm its functionality, I find no cause to alter the original assessment.

Final: **True**
