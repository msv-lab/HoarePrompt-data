The provided program correctly implements a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number, as defined by the problem description. The annotations confirm that the function is designed to handle non-negative integers, computes the required sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits, and checks for equality with the original number.

The original assessment identified an important consideration: the function does not handle negative input values. However, given the assumption that the program will only be provided valid non-negative integers, the function behaves correctly. The assertion checks confirm that the function correctly identifies 153 as an Armstrong number and correctly returns false for 259 and 4458.

Therefore, the original assessment that declares the program "False" due to potential handling of negative integers is overly cautious in light of the assumption of valid input. Since the program is intended to check Armstrong numbers and does so correctly based on the specified non-negative integers in the test assertions, I believe the original assessment should be revised.

Final: **True**
