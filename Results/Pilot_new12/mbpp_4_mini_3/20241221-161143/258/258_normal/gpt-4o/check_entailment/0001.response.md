Correctness: **True**

The program correctly defines a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a Narcissistic number) is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here is the breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Conversion**: The number `n` is converted to a string to facilitate the digit extraction.
2. **Length Calculation**: The length of this string representation (`num_len`) gives the number of digits in the number.
3. **Armstrong Sum Calculation**: The sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` is calculated using a generator expression within the `sum()` function.
4. **Comparison**: Finally, the calculated sum is checked to see if it is equal to the original number `n`.

The example assertions provided in the program also cover common test cases:
- `153` is an Armstrong number (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153).
- `259` is not (2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 2 + 125 + 729 = 856).
- `4458` is not (4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 = 4333).

Testing for various numbers including single-digit numbers (which are always Armstrong numbers) will consistently return correct results. Therefore, I could not find any case where the function fails to correctly identify Armstrong numbers.

Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem description comprehensively.
