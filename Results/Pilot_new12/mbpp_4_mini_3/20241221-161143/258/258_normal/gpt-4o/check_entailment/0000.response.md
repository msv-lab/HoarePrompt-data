To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the program code and the case for checking if a number is an Armstrong number.

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a number with `n` digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of `n`. For example:
- 153 is an Armstrong number because \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 \).
- 259 is not, since \( 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 2 + 125 + 729 = 856 \).
- 4458 is also not an Armstrong number because \( 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 = 5127 \).

Now, let's closely inspect the given code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n
```

### Analysis
1. **Functionality**: 
   - The function converts the number to a string to iterate over its digits.
   - It calculates `num_len`, the number of digits.
   - It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` and checks if this sum equals the original number.

2. **Test Cases**: 
   - Three assertions provided are:
     - `func_1(153) == True` (correct)
     - `func_1(259) == False` (correct)
     - `func_1(4458) == False` (correct)

### Potential Issue
However, the condition to handle inputs less than 0 has not been provided:
- **Negative Numbers**: Negative numbers cannot be Armstrong numbers by the mathematical definition, but the function does not explicitly handle these. For example, calling `func_1(-1)` would return `False`, which is not what we might expect if we consider negative numbers in terms of their absolute value or lack of definition in this context.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not explicitly define what happens for negatives or potentially other boundary cases like single digit numbers (which are always Armstrong numbers), we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation**: While the code works correctly for positive integers based on the given assertions, it does not handle negative inputs (e.g., `func_1(-1)`), which is an edge case the description does not account for, hence leading to undefined behavior regarding the Armstrong property.
