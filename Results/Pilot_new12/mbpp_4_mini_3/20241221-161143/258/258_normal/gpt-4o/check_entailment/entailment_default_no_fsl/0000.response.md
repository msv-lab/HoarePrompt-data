Correctness: **False**

The program checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number, which is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. While the function correctly handles non-negative integers, it fails to address negative integers and explicitly states that it assumes the input will be a non-negative integer.

However, the provided output hints do not clarify the constraints on the input regarding negative values, leading to ambiguity. If a negative integer such as `-153` is passed to the function, it would not produce a valid output since the logic does not account for negative scenarios. Thus, it's important for the implementation to ensure it correctly identifies non-negative integers exclusively or raise an appropriate indication when receiving an out-of-scope value.

Additionally, since partial correctness is deemed incorrect, the failure to explicitly handle cases where the input might not be a non-negative integer leads us to conclude the program is incorrect.
