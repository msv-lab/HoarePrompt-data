Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements a function that checks whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits and comparing it to the original number. The output hints confirm that the function is designed to handle non-negative integers correctly and returns a boolean result as expected. The test cases included in the code demonstrate that the function works properly for the provided examples. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description comprehensively, and there is no evidence from the output hints suggesting any failure in functionality.
