Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to its string representation, and calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits in `n`. It then checks whether this sum is equal to the original number `n`. This function effectively checks if `n` is an Armstrong number (or narcissistic number). The function always returns a boolean value: `True` if `n` is an Armstrong number and `False` otherwise. It does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, as it explicitly assumes `n` is a non-negative integer.**
