To analyze the code snippet provided:

1. **Understanding the Impact**: 
   - `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, which means it consists of the digits of `n` as characters.
   - `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, indicating how many characters are in `num_str`.
   - The line `armstrong_sum` is calculated as the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`.

2. **Previous Values of Affected Variables**:
   - `num_str` corresponds to `n` in string form.
   - `num_len` corresponds to the length of `num_str`, which equals the number of digits in `n`.
   - `armstrong_sum` is the new variable being defined by the expression.

3. **Calculating the Result**: 
   - Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `num_len` is the number of its digits.
   - The value of `armstrong_sum` will be `sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)`, which is the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of `num_len`.

The output will update to reflect the value of `armstrong_sum` while retaining the other valid information about `n`, `num_str`, and `num_len`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`; `armstrong_sum` is equal to the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
