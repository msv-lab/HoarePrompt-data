The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it checks whether the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return a boolean indicating whether the condition regarding the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits holds true for `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a non-negative integer, and returns whether the sum of each digit of n raised to the power of the number of digits in n is equal to n.**
