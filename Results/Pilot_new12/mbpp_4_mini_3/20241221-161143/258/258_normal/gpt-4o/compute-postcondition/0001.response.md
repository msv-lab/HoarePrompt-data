The variable `num_len` is assigned the value of the length of the string `num_str`. The variable `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, which is a non-negative integer. Therefore, `num_len` will represent the number of digits in the non-negative integer `n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, which equals the number of digits in `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.**
