The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. It returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list consists of the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list consists of the elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. Edge cases include when `L` is 0, resulting in an empty first list and the entire original list as the second list, and when `L` equals the length of `lst`, resulting in the first list being the entire original list and the second list being empty. The function correctly handles these scenarios as per the provided conditions.
