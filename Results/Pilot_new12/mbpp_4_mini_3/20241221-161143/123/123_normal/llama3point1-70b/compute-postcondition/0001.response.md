The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. The parameter `lst` is a list of elements, and `L` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)} \). The function returns a tuple containing the first `L` elements of the list `lst` and the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and return a tuple with the first `L` elements and the remainder of the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple consisting of the first `L` elements of the list and the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list.**
