Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and splits the list into two parts as specified. The first part contains the first `L` elements, and the second part contains the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list.

The output hints confirm the expected behavior of the function:
1. When `L` is 0, the first part should be an empty list `[]` and the second part should be the entire original list.
2. When `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first part should be the entire list and the second part should be empty.

Thus, all edge cases have been covered appropriately, and the function produces the expected results for valid inputs. Therefore, the function adheres to the problem requirements in every potential scenario.
