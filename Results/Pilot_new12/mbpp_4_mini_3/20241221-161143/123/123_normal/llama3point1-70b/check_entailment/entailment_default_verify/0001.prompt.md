You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function correctly splits a list into two parts based on the integer L. Specifically, it takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` and returns a tuple containing two lists: the first part with length `L` (i.e., `lst[:L]`) and the second part containing the remainder of the list (i.e., `lst[L:]`). 

The function handles various cases correctly:
1. If `L` is less than 0, it returns two empty lists because the slice `lst[:L]` would yield an empty list and `lst[L:]` would also yield an empty list.
2. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, `lst[:L]` returns the whole list, and `lst[L:]` returns an empty list.
3. If `L` is equal to the length of the list, it will return the original list as the first part and an empty list as the second part.
4. If `L` is 0, it returns an empty list and the entire list.

All scenarios, including edge cases, have been correctly addressed by the function. Thus, the program meets the problem description successfully without any logical flaws.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. It returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list consists of the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list consists of the elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. Edge cases include when `L` is 0, resulting in an empty first list and the entire original list as the second list, and when `L` equals the length of `lst`, resulting in the first list being the entire original list and the second list being empty. The function correctly handles these scenarios as per the provided conditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
