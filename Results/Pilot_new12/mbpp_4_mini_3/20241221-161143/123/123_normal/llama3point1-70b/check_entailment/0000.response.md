Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly splits the list `lst` into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. It uses slicing to accomplish this, which is a valid approach in Python. 

For example:
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `L = 2`, the function would return `([1, 2], [3, 4])`.
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `L = 0`, the function would return `([], [1, 2, 3, 4])`, which is also expected as the first part will have no elements.
- If `lst = []` and `L = 0`, it will return `([], [])`, which is again correct.

The function handles edge cases appropriately, including cases where `L` is larger than the length of the list or when the list is empty. In all scenarios, the output meets the problem description's requirement. Thus, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
