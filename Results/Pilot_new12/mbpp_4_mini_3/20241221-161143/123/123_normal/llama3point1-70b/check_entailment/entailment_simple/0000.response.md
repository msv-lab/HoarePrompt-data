Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. 

Explanation:
1. The function `func_1(lst, L)` is designed to take a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
2. It slices the list into two parts:
   - The first part contains the first `L` elements of the list: `lst[:L]`
   - The second part contains the elements from index `L` to the end of the list: `lst[L:]`
3. The function then returns a tuple containing these two sublists.

The implementation adheres to the requirement that the first part has a length of `L` and that both parts are derived from the original list, with the second part containing the remaining elements as specified. Additionally, the constraints mentioned in the annotated program (0 <= L <= len(lst)) ensure that the function will handle all valid inputs appropriately without errors.

Thus, the program meets the problem description's requirements in all scenarios defined.
