Correctness: **True**

The provided function correctly splits a list into two parts based on the integer L. Specifically, it takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` and returns a tuple containing two lists: the first part with length `L` (i.e., `lst[:L]`) and the second part containing the remainder of the list (i.e., `lst[L:]`). 

The function handles various cases correctly:
1. If `L` is less than 0, it returns two empty lists because the slice `lst[:L]` would yield an empty list and `lst[L:]` would also yield an empty list.
2. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, `lst[:L]` returns the whole list, and `lst[L:]` returns an empty list.
3. If `L` is equal to the length of the list, it will return the original list as the first part and an empty list as the second part.
4. If `L` is 0, it returns an empty list and the entire list.

All scenarios, including edge cases, have been correctly addressed by the function. Thus, the program meets the problem description successfully without any logical flaws.
