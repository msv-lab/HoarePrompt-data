Explanation: The program correctly splits the given list into two parts based on the integer L. It handles the specified edge cases where L is 0 (resulting in the first part as an empty list and the second part as the entire original list) and where L equals the length of the list (resulting in the first part being the entire original list and the second part as an empty list). Since the value of L is guaranteed to be within the range of valid indices for the list (i.e., 0 <= L <= len(lst)), there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**.
