Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` accurately fulfills the requirements stated in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`. The annotations confirm that `L` is always a non-negative integer and satisfies the condition `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. This means that the function will always be provided valid inputs.

2. **Splitting the List**: The function returns a tuple consisting of two parts:
   - The first part, `lst[:L]`, represents the first `L` elements of the list.
   - The second part, `lst[L:]`, consists of the elements from index `L` to the end of the list.
  
   This satisfies the requirement to split the list into two parts: one with length `L` and the second containing the remaining elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `L` is `0`, `lst[:0]` results in an empty list `[]`, and `lst[0:]` results in the entire original list, which meets the expected behavior described.
   - When `L` equals the length of `lst`, `lst[:len(lst)]` gives the whole list, and `lst[len(lst):]` results in an empty list `[]`. Again, this conforms to the expected behavior.

The function operates correctly for all valid cases according to the problem description, thoroughly handling different scenarios as annotated.

Therefore, the program meets the criteria outlined in the problem description, confirming its correctness.
