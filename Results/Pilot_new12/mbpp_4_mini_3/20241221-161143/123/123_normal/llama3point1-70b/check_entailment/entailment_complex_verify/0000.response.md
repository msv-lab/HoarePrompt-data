Based on the provided problem description, the program's functionality, and the annotated version of the code, I can confirm that the function `func_1` behaves as expected. The program correctly splits the list `lst` into two parts based on the integer `L`, adhering to the condition that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. 

The original assessment identified that the function handles edge cases appropriately, such as when `L` is 0 or when the length of `L` equals that of `lst`. As per the annotations, it accurately describes the state of the program before the function call and the output generated by the slicing operation. 

The overall logic outlined in the annotations matches the requirements set forth by the problem description, ensuring that the output is valid for all cases mentioned. 

Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains accurate. 

Final: **True**
