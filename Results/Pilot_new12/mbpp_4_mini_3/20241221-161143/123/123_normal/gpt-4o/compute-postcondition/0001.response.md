The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. `lst` is a list that can contain any elements, and `L` is a non-negative integer constrained by the condition that 0 <= L <= len(lst). After executing the function body, it returns a tuple consisting of two elements: the first element is a sublist of `lst` from the start of the list to index L (exclusive), and the second element is a sublist of `lst` from index L to the end of the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and to return a tuple containing two sublists divided at the index `L`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple of two sublists: the first from the start of `lst` to index `L` (exclusive), and the second from index `L` to the end of `lst`.**
