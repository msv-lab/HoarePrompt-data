Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the length `L` is greater than the length of the input list `lst`. If `L` is larger than the list, the slicing `lst[:L]` will take the whole list, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list. This does not comply with the requirement of splitting the list into two parts of length L and what remains. 

For example, calling `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` would result in `([1, 2, 3], [])`, which is not a valid split given that L is greater than the list length. The intended behavior should presumably not return a split when L exceeds the list length.

Thus, the function fails the requirement when `L` is larger than the size of the list.
