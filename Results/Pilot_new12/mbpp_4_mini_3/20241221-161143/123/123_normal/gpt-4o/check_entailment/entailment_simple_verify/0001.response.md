Based on the problem description, the program is expected to split a list into two parts based on a provided integer L, which signifies the length of the first part. The program's output should be a tuple containing these two parts.

Looking at the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

The function uses Python's slicing capabilities to achieve the required split. Given the assumptions in the original assessment regarding valid input, the function correctly handles the specified cases (when L is 0, greater than the length of the list, and when the list is empty). The expected behavior matches the supposed output described in the problem statement. The provided assertions validate the correct functionality of the code with a variety of input scenarios.

The annotated version reinforces this behavior by confirming the state of the program before the function call and stating that L is a non-negative integer within valid bounds.

Since both the original assessment and the annotated code provide consistent evidence that the function behaves as expected and meets the problem description, I find the original assessment to be accurate.

Final: **True**
