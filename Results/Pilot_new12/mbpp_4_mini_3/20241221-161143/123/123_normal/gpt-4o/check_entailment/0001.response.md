To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, we will analyze the function `func_1` against the problem description.

The function `func_1` is supposed to:
- Take in a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
- Split the list into two parts: the first part should contain the first `L` elements of the list, and the second part should contain the remaining elements.
- Return these two parts as a tuple.

```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

Now, let's break down the potential edge cases for the arguments provided to `func_1`:

1. **When L is 0**: The function should return two parts, the first part being an empty list and the second part being the entire list.
   - For example: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` should return `([], [1, 2, 3])`.

2. **When L is greater than the length of the list**: The function should return the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part.
   - For example: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` should return `([1, 2, 3], [])`.

3. **When the list is empty**: Regardless of the value of `L`, the function should always return two empty lists.
   - For example: `func_1([], 0)` should return `([], [])`, and `func_1([], 1)` should also return `([], [])`.

Let's evaluate the expected outcomes based on the specific cases highlighted:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` → Expected: `([], [1, 2, 3])`, Actual: `([], [1, 2, 3])` (Correct)
- `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` → Expected: `([1, 2, 3], [])`, Actual: `([1, 2, 3], [])` (Correct)
- `func_1([], 0)` → Expected: `([], [])`, Actual: `([], [])` (Correct)
- `func_1([], 1)` → Expected: `([], [])`, Actual: `([], [])` (Correct)

Since the function works correctly for these edge cases, the logic in `func_1` handles all described potential cases mentioned in the problem statement.

Given all the evaluations and edge cases considered, I find no examples where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description:

Correctness: **True**
