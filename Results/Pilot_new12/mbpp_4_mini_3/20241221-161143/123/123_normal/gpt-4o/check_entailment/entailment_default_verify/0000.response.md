The output hints specify that the function `func_1` is intended to accept a list and a non-negative integer `L`, where it is guaranteed that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. This implies that the function is expected to split the list correctly according to the specified conditions. The examples provided in the hints demonstrate the expected behavior of the function when the conditions are met.

The original assessment stated that the function does not handle cases where `L` exceeds the length of the input list `lst`, which was justified based on the assumption that such scenarios arise. However, the output hints clarify that the function is expected to operate correctly only under the guarantee that `L` is within valid bounds.

Since the hints assert that `L` will always be in the range `[0, len(lst)]`, the function `func_1` meets the problem description and behaves as intended according to the provided hints. Therefore, the issue presented in the original assessment does not hold, as it is presumed that invalid inputs for `L` will not be encountered given the input constraints.

Thus, I conclude that the original assessment was not accurate based on the guarantees stated in the output hints.

Final: **True**
