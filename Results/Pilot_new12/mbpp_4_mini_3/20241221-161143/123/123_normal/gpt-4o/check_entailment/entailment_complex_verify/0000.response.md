The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not handle cases where `L` is greater than the length of the input list `lst`. However, the annotated version clarifies that the function is expected to operate under the assumption that `L` will never exceed the length of `lst`. Therefore, the cases where `L` exceeds the length of the list are not relevant for assessment based on the problem description and provided constraints.

According to the annotations, the program does handle valid inputs correctly: when `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, it returns a tuple with the first part containing the first `L` elements and the second part containing the remainder of the list. Additionally, it states that the function outputs an empty list for the second part when `L` equals the length of `lst`, which is consistent with the behavior outlined in the problem description.

Thus, the original assessment is not accurate since it considers situations that are explicitly ruled out by the assumptions made about the input. Based on the provided annotations, the function meets the requirements as stated.

Final: **True**
