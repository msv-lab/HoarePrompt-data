Correctness: **True**

The program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically:

1. The function `func_1(lst, L)` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
2. It correctly splits the list into two parts:
   - The first part is extracted from the start of the list up to index `L` (exclusive), which is done using `lst[:L]`.
   - The second part consists of the remainder of the list starting from index `L` to the end, achieved using `lst[L:]`.
3. The function returns these two parts as a tuple.

Additionally, the function adheres to the constraint that `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. This means:
- If `L` is `0`, it will return an empty list for the first part and the entire list for the second part, which matches the requirement.
- If `L` is equal to the length of the list, the first part will include all elements and the second part will be empty, again aligning with the problem's expectations.

The assertions provided in the test cases confirm that the function returns the expected output for various valid inputs, showcasing its correctness across different scenarios. Since it operates correctly given the constraints specified, we can conclude that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
