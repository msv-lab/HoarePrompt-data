You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3) == ([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2) == (['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])
assert func_1(['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], 4) == (['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'])

def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the length `L` is greater than the length of the input list `lst`. If `L` is larger than the list, the slicing `lst[:L]` will take the whole list, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list. This does not comply with the requirement of splitting the list into two parts of length L and what remains. 

For example, calling `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` would result in `([1, 2, 3], [])`, which is not a valid split given that L is greater than the list length. The intended behavior should presumably not return a split when L exceeds the list length.

Thus, the function fails the requirement when `L` is larger than the size of the list.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. It returns a tuple containing two sublists: the first sublist is made up of the elements in `lst` from the beginning to index `L` (exclusive), and the second sublist consists of the elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. The function correctly handles cases where `L` is `0`, resulting in the first sublist being empty, or when `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, resulting in the second sublist being empty. The function does not perform any error handling for invalid values of `L`, but these are already guaranteed by the provided conditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
