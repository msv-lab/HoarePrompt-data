The problem description specifies that the function should take a list and an integer \( L \), and split the list into two parts where the first part has a length of \( L \). The function should return these parts in a tuple.

The original assessment claims that the function is incorrect because it does not handle cases where \( L \) exceeds the list length, which could lead to an unintended behavior since the expectation is to split the list. 

However, the annotations clarify that before calling the function, \( L \) is already constrained to be a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)} \). Given this constraint, the function will always behave correctly; it will either return a split where the first part is of length \( L \) and the second part is what remains, or return an empty second part if \( L \) is equal to the length of the list. 

Since the annotated code assures that the input will always meet the expected conditions, the original concern regarding cases where \( L \) is greater than the length of the list does not apply.

In conclusion, since the function meets the problem description by properly slicing the input list given the constraints specified in the annotations, the function is indeed correct, and the original assessment was inaccurate.

Final: **True**
