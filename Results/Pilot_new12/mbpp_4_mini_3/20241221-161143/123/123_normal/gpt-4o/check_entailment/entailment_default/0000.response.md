Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` properly splits the list into two parts based on the provided integer `L`, adhering to the problem description. It correctly handles edge cases, such as when `L` is 0 (resulting in an empty first sublist) and when `L` is equal to the length of the list (resulting in an empty second sublist). The assertions provided indicate that the function works as expected for various inputs, confirming that it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. There are no identified cases where the function fails to perform correctly.
