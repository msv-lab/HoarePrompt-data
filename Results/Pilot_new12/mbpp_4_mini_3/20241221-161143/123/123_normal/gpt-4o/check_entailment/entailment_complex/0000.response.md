Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Signature and Input**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of elements, and `L`, a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Splitting Logic**:
   - The function uses slicing to split the list:
     - `lst[:L]` creates the first part of the list, which includes elements from the start of the list up to but not including index `L`.
     - `lst[L:]` creates the second part, which includes elements from index `L` to the end of the list.
   - This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement to split the list into two parts at the index defined by `L`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `L` is `0`, the first sublist will be empty (`[]`), and the second sublist will contain the entire original list. This is a correct behavior as no elements are included in the first part.
   - If `L` equals `len(lst)`, the first sublist will contain all elements, and the second part will be empty (`[]`). This is also a correct behavior consistent with the problem description.

4. **Correctness of Assertions**:
   - The assertions included in the annotated program confirm that the function returns the expected tuple for various inputs, further demonstrating its correctness.

5. **Assumption of Valid Inputs**:
   - The program is designed under the assumption that the inputs will adhere to the stated constraints (i.e., `L` being a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of `lst`). Therefore, there is no need for error handling for invalid input scenarios, as these are guaranteed by the problem description.

In summary, since the function behaves as specified in the problem description across all potential cases and adheres to the guarantees about input validity, it is deemed correct.
