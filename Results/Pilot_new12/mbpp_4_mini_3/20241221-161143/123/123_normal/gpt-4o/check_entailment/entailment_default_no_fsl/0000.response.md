Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function as per the problem description. It takes a list and an integer L, and splits the list into two parts: the first part contains the first L elements of the list, and the second part contains the remaining elements. 

The program handles the edge cases as described:
1. If L is 0, the first sublist is empty, and the second sublist contains all elements of the original list.
2. If L is equal to the length of the list, the first sublist contains all elements, and the second sublist is empty.
3. It works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range of L (0 <= L <= len(lst)).

Therefore, there are no identified cases where the program fails to conform to the problem description or the expected output.
