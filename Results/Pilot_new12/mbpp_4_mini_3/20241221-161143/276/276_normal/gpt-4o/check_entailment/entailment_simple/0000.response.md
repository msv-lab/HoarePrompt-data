Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's why it meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` accepts two lists (`list1` and `list2`) and an integer (`n`) representing their size. The assumption is made that these inputs will always meet the specified conditions (both lists being of the same size and valid integers).

2. **Merging and Sorting**: The function correctly merges the two lists and sorts the combined list. This is essential for accurately determining the median.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The function differentiates between even and odd lengths of the merged list to compute the median. 
   - It accesses the middle elements based on whether the total count of elements is even or odd, applying the correct formula to compute the median accordingly.
   - For an even-length list, it calculates the average of the two middle elements, while for an odd-length list, it simply selects the middle element.

4. **Output**: The function returns the median, which fulfills the requirement of finding the median of two sorted lists.

Overall, the implementation effectively adheres to the problem's requirement to find and return the median of two sorted lists of the same size, ensuring it handles both even and odd cases correctly. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
