Correctness: **False**

The program fails to account for the fact that the two input lists should be of the same size as specified in the problem description. The function does not check for this condition and will produce incorrect results if the lists are of different sizes.

For example, consider the following test case:
```python
assert func_1([1, 2], [3, 4, 5], 3)  # Here list1 has 2 elements and list2 has 3 elements.
```
This would lead to an incorrect merging of the lists and an incorrect calculation of the median.

Therefore, the function does not strictly follow the problem description as it does not ensure that the lists are of the same size before attempting to calculate the median.
