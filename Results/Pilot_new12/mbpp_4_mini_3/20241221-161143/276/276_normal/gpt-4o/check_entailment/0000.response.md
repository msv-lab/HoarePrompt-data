Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the median of two sorted lists when the size of these lists is determined by the parameter `n`. Specifically, if the lengths of the input lists `list1` and `list2` are not equal to `n` (even if they are both sorted), the median calculation will be inaccurate. For instance, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 3)`, it will still merge the two lists to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and return `3.5` instead of correctly handling the `n` parameter to indicate that the lists should be a specific size. Thus, there are cases where the output will not reflect the correct median when given lists of lengths other than `n`.
