Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not enforce the requirement that both input lists must be of the same size. Even though the annotated version indicates that when the function is executed, the inputs `list1` and `list2` are assumed to be of the same size, the function itself lacks any checks to ensure this condition is met. As such, it can produce incorrect results if the input lists are of different sizes. The assessment correctly identifies this flaw in the implementation, which contradicts the problem description. Thus, the program fails to meet the specified requirements.
