Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The problem description explicitly requires that the two input lists must be of the same size. The program's implementation does not include any checks to enforce this condition, meaning it could produce incorrect results when given lists of different lengths. The annotated version confirms that `list1` and `list2` are assumed to be of the same size only for the purposes of evaluating the median, but the function lacks validation to ensure that this condition is met at runtime. Therefore, without proper constraints on input, the logic can fail in cases where the conditions are not satisfied, indicating a failure to meet the problem description's requirements.
