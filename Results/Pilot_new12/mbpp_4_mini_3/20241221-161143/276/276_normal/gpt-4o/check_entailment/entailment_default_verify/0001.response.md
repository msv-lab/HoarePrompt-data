Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program fails to ensure that the two input lists are of the same size, as specified in the problem description. Although the function correctly merges the lists and calculates the median, it does not include any checks to verify that the sizes of `list1` and `list2` are identical. This causes potential issues, as demonstrated in the test case provided in the original assessment where one list has a different number of elements than the other. Therefore, the function does not strictly adhere to the problem requirements, which leads to its classification as incorrect.
