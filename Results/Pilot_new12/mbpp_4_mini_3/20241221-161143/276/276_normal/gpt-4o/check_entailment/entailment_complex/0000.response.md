Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size as described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Signature and Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2`, along with an integer `n`. The problem requires the function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, which is fulfilled by the parameters.

2. **Merging and Sorting**:
   - The program merges `list1` and `list2` using `list1 + list2` and then sorts the combined list with `sorted()`. This step ensures that the median calculation is based on the correct merged dataset.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the middle index `mid` and checks if the total number of elements in the merged list is even or odd. For even lengths, it takes the average of the two middle elements to determine the median. For odd lengths, it directly accesses the middle element. This approach aligns perfectly with how medians are conventionally computed.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The assertions provided in the annotated program verify that the function returns the correct median for various test cases, showing that the implementation handles the median calculation correctly for both odd and even combined lengths.

Although the annotations mention that the function does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or have different sizes, the correctness assessment is based on the assumption that valid input will always be provided, per the specified instructions. Thus, the overall implementation adheres to the problem description accurately in computing the median from two sorted lists of the same size.
