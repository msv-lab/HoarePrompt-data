`merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. Since `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size and are defined as such, the `merged_list` will be a sorted list containing all the elements from both lists. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the operation.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining elements from `list1` and `list2`.**
