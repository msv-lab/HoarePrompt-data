Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining elements from `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `len(merged_list) // 2` which is the length of `list1` (or `list2`). The length of `merged_list` is even.***
