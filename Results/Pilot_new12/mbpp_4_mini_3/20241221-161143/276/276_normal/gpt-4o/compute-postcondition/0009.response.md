Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of the same size, and a positive integer `n` representing the size of these lists. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list. The function calculates and returns the median value of this merged list. If the merged list has an even number of elements, the median is computed as the average of the two middle elements. If the merged list has an odd number of elements, the median is simply the middle element. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or of different sizes, which could lead to errors. Additionally, while the parameter `n` is accepted, it is not utilized within the function, indicating potential for further implementation considerations.**
