The value of `mid` is assigned the value of half the length of `merged_list`. Since `merged_list` is a sorted list combining elements from `list1` and `list2`, the length of `merged_list` will be equal to the combined lengths of `list1` and `list2`. As both `list1` and `list2` are of the same size, and assuming `list1` and `list2` each have `m` elements, the length of `merged_list` would be `2m`. Therefore, `mid` will be equal to `m`, which represents the index of the middle element of the merged list.

The states of `list1`, `list2`, `n`, and `merged_list` are not altered by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining elements from `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `len(merged_list) // 2` which is the length of `list1` (or `list2`)**.
