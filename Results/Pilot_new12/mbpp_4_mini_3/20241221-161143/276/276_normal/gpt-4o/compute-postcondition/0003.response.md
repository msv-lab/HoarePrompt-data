The variable `median` is assigned the value of the average of the two middle elements of `merged_list`. Given that `mid` is equal to `len(merged_list) // 2`, the two middle elements are `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`. Since the length of `merged_list` is even, the `median` will be the average of these two values. 

The states of the other variables do not change. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining elements from `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `len(merged_list) // 2` which is the length of `list1` (or `list2`); `median` is the value `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`.**
