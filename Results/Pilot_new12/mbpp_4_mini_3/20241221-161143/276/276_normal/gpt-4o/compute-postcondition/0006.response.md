Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining elements from `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `len(merged_list) // 2`. If `merged_list` has an even number of elements, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements, `median` being the value `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`. If `merged_list` has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element of `merged_list`, where `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]`.***
