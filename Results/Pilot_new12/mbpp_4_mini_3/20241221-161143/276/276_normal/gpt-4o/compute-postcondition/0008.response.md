The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists of integers and have the same size. The function also accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the size of the lists. After executing the function body, it returns the median of the merged list formed by combining `list1` and `list2`. If the length of the merged list is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, it returns the middle element.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, of the same size, and a positive integer `n`. It returns the median of the merged list formed by `list1` and `list2`, calculated as the average of the two middle elements if the merged list length is even, or the middle element if it is odd.**
