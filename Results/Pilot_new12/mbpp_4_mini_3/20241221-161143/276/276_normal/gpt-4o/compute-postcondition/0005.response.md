The statement `median = merged_list[mid]` assigns the value of the element at index `mid` from the `merged_list` to the variable `median`. Given that `mid` is calculated using the expression `len(merged_list) // 2`, and since the length of `merged_list` is an odd number, `mid` will be an integer representing the index of the middle element in the sorted list. 

The preconditions regarding the lists, `n`, and the characteristics of `merged_list` remain unchanged, while the variable `median` is now assigned a specific value based on the contents of `merged_list`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining elements from `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `len(merged_list) // 2`; `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]` (the middle element of `merged_list`).**
