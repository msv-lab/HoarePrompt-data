#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers of the same size, and n is a positive integer representing the size of the lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining elements from `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `len(merged_list) // 2`. If `merged_list` has an even number of elements, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements, `median` being the value `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`. If `merged_list` has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element of `merged_list`, where `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is calculated as the average of the two middle elements if the length of the merged list is even, or the middle element if the length is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of the same size, and a positive integer `n` representing the size of these lists. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list. The function calculates and returns the median value of this merged list. If the merged list has an even number of elements, the median is computed as the average of the two middle elements. If the merged list has an odd number of elements, the median is simply the middle element. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or of different sizes, which could lead to errors. Additionally, while the parameter `n` is accepted, it is not utilized within the function, indicating potential for further implementation considerations.
