You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw when calculating the median. The variable `middle_index` is incorrectly defined as `size - 1`, which corresponds to the index of the last element in the merged list. 

In case of two sorted lists of the same size, say of size `n`, the correct middle index for calculating the median should be `n-1` or `n` depending on whether the total number of elements is odd or even. 

For example, if we have two sorted lists:

- `list1 = [1, 3]`
- `list2 = [2, 4]`
- both sizes = 2 (size is even)

The correct merged list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The correct median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

However, in the program, it tries to access indices with `middle_index`, leading to an incorrect median calculation, as it uses the last two elements of the merged list, which doesn't represent the middle elements properly.

Therefore, the logic does not handle finding the median correctly for both odd and even lengths of the merged array. 

Hence, the implementation does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are two sorted lists of the same size, and size is a positive integer that represents the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of the same size; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` and `list2`; `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. If `size` is even, then `median` is equal to `(merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2`. If `size` is odd, then `median` is equal to `merged_list[size - 1]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value calculated from 'merged_list', where if 'size' is even, the median is the average of 'merged_list[middle_index]' and 'merged_list[middle_index + 1]', and if 'size' is odd, the median is 'merged_list[size - 1]'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists, `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `size`, which represents the length of both lists. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list called `merged_list`. The function then computes and returns the median value of this merged list. If `size` is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values in `merged_list`. If `size` is odd, the median is simply the middle value of `merged_list`. However, the function assumes that both input lists are of the same size and sorted, but it does not handle edge cases such as when the sizes are not equal, empty lists, or non-sorted input lists. Additionally, the calculation of `middle_index` incorrectly does not account for the fact that the two middle indices in an even sized list should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`, leading to a potential out-of-bounds error in accessing those indices if `size` is not at least 2. Overall, the function primarily aims to return the statistical median of the combined sorted lists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
