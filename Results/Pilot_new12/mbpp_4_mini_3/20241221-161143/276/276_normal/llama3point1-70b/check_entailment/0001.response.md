Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw when calculating the median. The variable `middle_index` is incorrectly defined as `size - 1`, which corresponds to the index of the last element in the merged list. 

In case of two sorted lists of the same size, say of size `n`, the correct middle index for calculating the median should be `n-1` or `n` depending on whether the total number of elements is odd or even. 

For example, if we have two sorted lists:

- `list1 = [1, 3]`
- `list2 = [2, 4]`
- both sizes = 2 (size is even)

The correct merged list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The correct median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

However, in the program, it tries to access indices with `middle_index`, leading to an incorrect median calculation, as it uses the last two elements of the merged list, which doesn't represent the middle elements properly.

Therefore, the logic does not handle finding the median correctly for both odd and even lengths of the merged array. 

Hence, the implementation does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
