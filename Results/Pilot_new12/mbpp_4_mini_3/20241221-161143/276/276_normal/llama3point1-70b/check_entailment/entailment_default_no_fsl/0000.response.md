Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the median for all potential cases. Specifically, the calculation of the `middle_index` when the size is even is incorrect. The program currently sets `middle_index = size - 1` which causes it to access the wrong indices in the merged list to compute the median. For even sizes, the median should be calculated at indices `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`.

For example, if `size` is 4, the correct middle indices should be `1` and `2`. The program incorrectly accesses indices `3` and `4`, which can lead to an out-of-bounds error if `size` is not handled correctly. 

Additionally, while the problem description states the lists are of the same size and sorted, the code does not have checks for this assumption, meaning it could potentially fail if less than two elements are present in the lists during execution.

Thus, due to the erroneous index calculations and assumptions about input size, the program is deemed incorrect.
