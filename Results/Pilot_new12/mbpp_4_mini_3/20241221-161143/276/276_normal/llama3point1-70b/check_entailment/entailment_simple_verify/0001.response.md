The annotated version of the code explains the program's state before and after the function call, clearly describing how the program operates. 

Let's break it down:
- The function begins by merging the two sorted lists into `merged_list` and sorting that list.
- The `middle_index` is set as `size - 1`, which is indeed incorrect in the context of finding the median. The `middle_index` should be derived based on the effective total size, which is `2 * size`, since there are two lists.
- The annotation suggests that if `size` is even, it's attempting to find the median using the last two elements of the merged list, which again is a logical flaw. For an even size `n`, the indices the program accesses to compute the median should be `n-1` and `n` (i.e., `size` in this context should actually be doubled since we merged two lists).

The confusion arises because:
- The middle index for a sorted list of length `n` (where `n` is the total length after merging two lists) should reflect the positions corresponding to the middle elements correctly. 

As per the original assessment, it accurately identifies the central flaw which is indicative of a critical logical error in the median calculation. The code does not correctly handle both scenarios (even and odd sizes), which results in incorrect behavior when the function is called.

Therefore:

Final: **False**
