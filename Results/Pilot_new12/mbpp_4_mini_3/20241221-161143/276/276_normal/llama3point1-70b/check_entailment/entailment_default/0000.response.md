The provided function aims to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list and calculates the median based on the size provided.

However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. The calculation of `middle_index` is incorrect for finding the two middle values in an even-sized list. It uses `size - 1` for the first middle index, which doesn't correctly identify the middle indices. For an even list size `size`, the correct indices should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`.

2. The code assumes that the lists are always of the same size and sorted without handling the possibility that the input might not meet these assumptions, although we can assume valid input as per the instruction.

3. The function will not correctly compute the median when the size of the lists is even because of the wrong indexing, potentially leading to a list out-of-bounds error.

For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]` with `size` being 2, `middle_index` will be `1`. The function tries to access `merged_list[1]` and `merged_list[2]`, but `merged_list` will have indices `0` and `1` for a four-element list.

Overall, the logic of merging the lists and computing the median makes sense, but due to the indexing error, the implementation will lead to incorrect results for even-sized lists.

Correctness: **False**.
