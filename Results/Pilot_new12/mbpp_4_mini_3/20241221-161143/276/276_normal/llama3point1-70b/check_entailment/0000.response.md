To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we will look into how it computes the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Problem Analysis:
- The median of two sorted lists of the same size, when merged, should be computed correctly.
- If the size of each list is `n`, the merged list will have a total size of `2n`.

### Program Review:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)  # Merging and sorting the two lists
    middle_index = size - 1  # This is incorrect; it should be size - 1 for odd or size for even median computation
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2  # Accessing indices incorrectly
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]  # This case is also incorrect
    return median
```

### Identifying Issues:
1. The given index for the median calculation is incorrect. 
   - For even-sized lists, when `size` is the total elements, `middle_index` should refer to the middle elements of the merged list as `size - 1` and `size`.
   - The `if size % 2 == 0:` part tries to access `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`, which will fail for the largest index since that index may not necessarily be valid when merging two lists of size `n` each, which means accessing beyond the bounds of the list if `size` is interpreted as the individual list size.

### Example Case of Incorrectness:
Consider `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, and `size = 2`.

According to the program:
- `merged_list` should yield `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Expected median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. 
- However, the program misses correctly calculating and retrieving the appropriate indices, leading to an index out of bounds error or, even if the lists were the same size, it wouldnâ€™t correctly work as intended in all cases, thus not providing the expected median.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly implement the functionality to calculate the median, and will yield incorrect results or errors for certain inputs, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
