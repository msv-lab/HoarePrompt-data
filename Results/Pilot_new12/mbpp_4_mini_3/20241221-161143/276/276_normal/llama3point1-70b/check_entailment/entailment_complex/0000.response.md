Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Specifically, the calculation of `middle_index` when `size` is even is incorrect. 

In the case where `size` is even, the current program calculates `middle_index` as `size - 1` and attempts to find the median using `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`. However, for even-sized lists, the two middle indices should actually be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. Hence, the indices to access should be `(size // 2 - 1)` and `(size // 2)`, not skewing the access based on `size - 1`.

As a result, if `size` is less than 2, this will also lead to an out-of-bounds error when trying to access elements of `merged_list`. Additionally, if `size` is exactly 2, this calculation will incorrectly average the wrong two elements, which does not yield the correct median. 

Therefore, due to this logical error in the median calculation, the program does not fulfill the problem description's requirement of correctly finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size.
