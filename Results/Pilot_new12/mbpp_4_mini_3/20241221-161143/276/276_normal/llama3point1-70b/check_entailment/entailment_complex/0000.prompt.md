You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are two sorted lists of the same size, and size is a positive integer that represents the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of the same size; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` and `list2`; `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. If `size` is even, then `median` is equal to `(merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2`. If `size` is odd, then `median` is equal to `merged_list[size - 1]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value calculated from 'merged_list', where if 'size' is even, the median is the average of 'merged_list[middle_index]' and 'merged_list[middle_index + 1]', and if 'size' is odd, the median is 'merged_list[size - 1]'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists, `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `size`, which represents the length of both lists. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list called `merged_list`. The function then computes and returns the median value of this merged list. If `size` is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values in `merged_list`. If `size` is odd, the median is simply the middle value of `merged_list`. However, the function assumes that both input lists are of the same size and sorted, but it does not handle edge cases such as when the sizes are not equal, empty lists, or non-sorted input lists. Additionally, the calculation of `middle_index` incorrectly does not account for the fact that the two middle indices in an even sized list should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`, leading to a potential out-of-bounds error in accessing those indices if `size` is not at least 2. Overall, the function primarily aims to return the statistical median of the combined sorted lists.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
