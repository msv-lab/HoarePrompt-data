You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we will look into how it computes the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Problem Analysis:
- The median of two sorted lists of the same size, when merged, should be computed correctly.
- If the size of each list is `n`, the merged list will have a total size of `2n`.

### Program Review:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)  # Merging and sorting the two lists
    middle_index = size - 1  # This is incorrect; it should be size - 1 for odd or size for even median computation
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2  # Accessing indices incorrectly
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]  # This case is also incorrect
    return median
```

### Identifying Issues:
1. The given index for the median calculation is incorrect. 
   - For even-sized lists, when `size` is the total elements, `middle_index` should refer to the middle elements of the merged list as `size - 1` and `size`.
   - The `if size % 2 == 0:` part tries to access `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`, which will fail for the largest index since that index may not necessarily be valid when merging two lists of size `n` each, which means accessing beyond the bounds of the list if `size` is interpreted as the individual list size.

### Example Case of Incorrectness:
Consider `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, and `size = 2`.

According to the program:
- `merged_list` should yield `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Expected median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. 
- However, the program misses correctly calculating and retrieving the appropriate indices, leading to an index out of bounds error or, even if the lists were the same size, it wouldnâ€™t correctly work as intended in all cases, thus not providing the expected median.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly implement the functionality to calculate the median, and will yield incorrect results or errors for certain inputs, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are two sorted lists of the same size, and size is a positive integer that represents the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of the same size; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` and `list2`; `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. If `size` is even, then `median` is equal to `(merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2`. If `size` is odd, then `median` is equal to `merged_list[size - 1]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value calculated from 'merged_list', where if 'size' is even, the median is the average of 'merged_list[middle_index]' and 'merged_list[middle_index + 1]', and if 'size' is odd, the median is 'merged_list[size - 1]'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
