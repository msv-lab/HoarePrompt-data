#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are two sorted lists of the same size, and size is a positive integer that represents the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of the same size; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` and `list2`; `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. If `size` is even, then `median` is equal to `(merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2`. If `size` is odd, then `median` is equal to `merged_list[size - 1]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value calculated from 'merged_list', where if 'size' is even, the median is the average of 'merged_list[middle_index]' and 'merged_list[middle_index + 1]', and if 'size' is odd, the median is 'merged_list[size - 1]'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists, `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `size`, which represents the length of both lists. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list called `merged_list`. The function then computes and returns the median value of this merged list. If `size` is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values in `merged_list`. If `size` is odd, the median is simply the middle value of `merged_list`. However, the function assumes that both input lists are of the same size and sorted, but it does not handle edge cases such as when the sizes are not equal, empty lists, or non-sorted input lists. Additionally, the calculation of `middle_index` incorrectly does not account for the fact that the two middle indices in an even sized list should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`, leading to a potential out-of-bounds error in accessing those indices if `size` is not at least 2. Overall, the function primarily aims to return the statistical median of the combined sorted lists.
