The value of `middle_index` is assigned to be `size - 1`. The previous value of `size` is a positive integer, so the value of `middle_index` will be `positive integer - 1`, which is still a non-negative integer. The states of `list1`, `list2`, and `merged_list` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of the same size; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` and `list2`; `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`.**
