The `merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. Since both `list1` and `list2` are sorted and of the same size, the merging will result in a sorted list that contains all elements from both lists. The size of `merged_list` will be twice that of either `list1` or `list2`. 

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of the same size; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` and `list2`.**
