The code assigns the value of `median` as the average of two middle elements from `merged_list`. Since `size` is even, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`, which means it will refer to the element at position `size - 1` and `size` in the sorted `merged_list`. Therefore, `median` will be the average of these two specific elements.

The previous state indicates that:
- `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` and `list2`.
- `middle_index` can be calculated as `size - 1`, leading to access to `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`.

Thus, `median` ends up being the average of the two middle elements of the `merged_list`, while the states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of the same size; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` and `list2`; `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`; and `size` is even; `median` is equal to `(merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2`.**
