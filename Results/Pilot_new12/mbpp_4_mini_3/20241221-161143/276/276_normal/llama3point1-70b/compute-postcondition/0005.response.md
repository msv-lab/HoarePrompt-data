`median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[middle_index]`. The value of `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`, and since `size` is an odd integer, `middle_index` represents the index of the median element in the sorted `merged_list`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of the same size; `size` is a positive odd integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` and `list2`; `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`; `median` is equal to `merged_list[size - 1]`.**
