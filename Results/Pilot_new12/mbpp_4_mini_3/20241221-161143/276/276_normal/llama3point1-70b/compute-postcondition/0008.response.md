The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both sorted lists of the same size, and a parameter `size`, which is a positive integer representing the length of both lists. After executing the function body, it calculates the median value from a merged list formed by combining `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle values from the merged list. If `size` is odd, it returns the value of the last element in the merged list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists and their size, and return the median value based on the merged list of these two inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists, list1 and list2, and a positive integer size, returning the median value calculated from the merged list of these two lists, either as the average of the two middle values if size is even, or as the last element if size is odd.**
