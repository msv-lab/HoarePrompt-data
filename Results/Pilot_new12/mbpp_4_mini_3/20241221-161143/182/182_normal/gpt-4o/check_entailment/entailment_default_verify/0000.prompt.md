You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']
assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']

def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function and the problem description.

### Problem description:
The task is to write a function that extracts only the last character (rear index element) of each string in a given tuple.

### Program:
```python
assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']
assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']

def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]
```

### Evaluation:
1. The function `func_1(tup)` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `tup`.
2. For each string `s`, it retrieves the last character using `s[-1]`.
3. The resulting list contains these last characters for all strings in the tuple.

### Test Cases:
The program includes three assertions that test the function. Let's analyze each:

- For the first assertion `func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers'))`, it correctly returns `['s', 'r', 's']`.
- For the second assertion `func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People'))`, it correctly returns `['e', 'r', 'e']`.
- For the third assertion `func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go'))`, it correctly returns `['a', 't', 'o']`.

### Edge Cases:
A potential edge case that the program does not handle correctly is when an empty string is included in the tuple or when the tuple contains an empty element. For example:
- If we test `func_1(('', 'test'))`, it will raise an `IndexError` because `s[-1]` will attempt to access a character from an empty string.

Also, if we input a tuple with an empty string, say `func_1(('test', '', 'example'))`, the function will also raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `[-1]` on the empty string.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where a string is empty. Since it fails for at least one potential case, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple of strings. It returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will generate an empty entry in the resulting list for that string, as it does not handle such cases explicitly. Furthermore, if `tup` contains non-string elements, it would result in a TypeError when the function attempts to access `s[-1]`. Hence, the final state of the program after execution will be a list representing the last characters of the valid strings, including empty entries for empty strings, with possible exceptions if the input contains non-string types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
