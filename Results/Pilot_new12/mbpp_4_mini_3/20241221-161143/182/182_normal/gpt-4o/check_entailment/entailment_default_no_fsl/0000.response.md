Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the strings in the input tuple may be empty. If an empty string is present in the tuple, it will produce an empty entry in the resulting list without any indication of this being an issue, which violates the expectation of clear correctness as stated in the problem description. Additionally, if the tuple contains non-string elements, it will lead to a TypeError, which is not acceptable behavior according to the problem requirements. Therefore, the program does not meet the correctness criteria for every potential case.
