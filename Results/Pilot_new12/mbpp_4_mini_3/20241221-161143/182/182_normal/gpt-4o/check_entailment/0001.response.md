Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to extract the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the given tuple.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. The function `func_1(tup)` takes a tuple of strings as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `tup`.
3. For each string, it accesses the last character using `s[-1]`.
4. It constructs and returns a list containing these last characters.

The given test cases confirm the functionality:
- For the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the last characters are `['s', 'r', 's']`, which matches the assertion.
- For `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, the last characters are `['e', 'r', 'e']`, which also matches.
- For `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, the last characters are `['a', 't', 'o']`, which matches.

There are no missing edge cases or logic flaws, as the function handles tuples of strings adequately. Even if an empty string (which would not cause errors but return an empty character) or a tuple with one string (which would work seamlessly) is passed, the function will still behave as expected.

Since there are no cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude the correctness assertion is true.
