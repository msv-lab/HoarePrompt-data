Final: **True** 

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program effectively meets the problem description by extracting the last character from each string in the given tuple. The provided test cases confirm that the implementation behaves as intended, producing the expected results for valid input.

The annotations clarify the function's operation, stating that it returns a list of last characters and explicitly mentioning that it does not account for empty strings or non-string elements, implying that certain edge cases could lead to a TypeError. However, according to the problem description, we assume valid input (a tuple of non-empty strings), which the function handles correctly. Therefore, while there are particular situations where the function might fail (e.g., if given an empty string), we follow the logic in the assessment that such cases do not concern this evaluation due to the assumptions made regarding input validity.

Overall, the logic of the function and the assertions established in the original assessment are consistent with the behavior indicated in the annotations, thereby reinforcing the conclusion that the program is correct as per the provided problem description.
