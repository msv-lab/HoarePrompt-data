Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by defining the function `func_1` which processes a tuple of strings. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each string `s` in the tuple `tup`, extracting the last character of each string using `s[-1]`. 

This matches the requirement to "extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple." The assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate that the function works as expected for various input tuples, returning a list of the last characters from each string. 

Since the assumptions state that the input will always be valid (i.e., the tuple will only contain strings), the program consistently returns the correct output for all potential valid cases. Therefore, it correctly meets the problem description's criteria.
