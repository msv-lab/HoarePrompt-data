Final: **False**

The original assessment incorrectly states the program's correctness as **True**. While the function does return the last character of each string in the tuple as intended, it does not adequately handle the cases of empty strings or non-string elements correctly. The output hints indicate that if there are empty strings present in the tuple, the function will generate an empty entry in the resulting list. Furthermore, if the tuple contains any non-string types, a TypeError will be raised when the function attempts to access them.

These factors indicate that the implementation is not robust and does not fully meet the expectations set out in the problem description for all potential inputs. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the program's behavior does not ensure correct outcomes under all expected scenarios.
