Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` fulfills the requirements of the problem description. It accepts a tuple of strings and correctly returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple.

- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input tuple `tup` and accesses the last character via `s[-1]`. This satisfies the requirement to "extract only the rear index element of each string".
- The provided assertions in the code serve as tests that show the function is designed to provide the correct output for various tuples of strings, demonstrating that the function works as intended.
- The consideration about empty strings resulting in empty entries in the list and potential exceptions with non-string types, while noted in the annotations, are not relevant because the problem statement assumes valid input will always be provided. Thus, under the given assumptions, the function behaves correctly.

In conclusion, since the function produces the expected results as defined in the problem description for valid inputs, it is deemed correct.
