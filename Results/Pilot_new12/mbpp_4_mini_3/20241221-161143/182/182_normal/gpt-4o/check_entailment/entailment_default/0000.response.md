The provided function `func_1` is designed to extract the last character from each string in a tuple of strings. The output hints indicate that the function does indeed return a list of the last characters, but they also point out some significant edge cases that the code fails to handle.

1. **Empty Strings**: If any string in the input tuple is empty, the program will return an empty entry in the list for that string. This is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, which could imply that such cases should be handled differently. For example, if the input tuple is `('', 'test')`, the output would be `['', 't']`, which could be considered undesirable.

2. **Non-String Elements**: The function assumes that the input will be a tuple of strings. However, if any non-string element is present in the tuple (e.g., numbers or objects), the function will raise a `TypeError` when it tries to access the last character with `s[-1]`. This could cause the program to crash, contradicting the assumption of handling inputs safely, as described in the problem.

Given these potential issues suggested by the output hints, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The code does return the last characters for valid string entries but does not correctly handle cases for empty strings or non-string elements, which are significant edge cases.
