You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']
assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']

def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to extract the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the given tuple.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. The function `func_1(tup)` takes a tuple of strings as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `tup`.
3. For each string, it accesses the last character using `s[-1]`.
4. It constructs and returns a list containing these last characters.

The given test cases confirm the functionality:
- For the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the last characters are `['s', 'r', 's']`, which matches the assertion.
- For `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, the last characters are `['e', 'r', 'e']`, which also matches.
- For `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, the last characters are `['a', 't', 'o']`, which matches.

There are no missing edge cases or logic flaws, as the function handles tuples of strings adequately. Even if an empty string (which would not cause errors but return an empty character) or a tuple with one string (which would work seamlessly) is passed, the function will still behave as expected.

Since there are no cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude the correctness assertion is true.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple of strings. It returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will generate an empty entry in the resulting list for that string, as it does not handle such cases explicitly. Furthermore, if `tup` contains non-string elements, it would result in a TypeError when the function attempts to access `s[-1]`. Hence, the final state of the program after execution will be a list representing the last characters of the valid strings, including empty entries for empty strings, with possible exceptions if the input contains non-string types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
