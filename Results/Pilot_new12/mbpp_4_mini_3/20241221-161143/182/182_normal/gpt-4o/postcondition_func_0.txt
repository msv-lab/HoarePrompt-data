The function accepts a parameter `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple of strings. It returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will generate an empty entry in the resulting list for that string, as it does not handle such cases explicitly. Furthermore, if `tup` contains non-string elements, it would result in a TypeError when the function attempts to access `s[-1]`. Hence, the final state of the program after execution will be a list representing the last characters of the valid strings, including empty entries for empty strings, with possible exceptions if the input contains non-string types.
