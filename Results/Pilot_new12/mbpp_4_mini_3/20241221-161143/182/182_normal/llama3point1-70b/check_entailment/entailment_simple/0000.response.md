Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character (rear index element) from each string in that tuple. The use of list comprehension with `s[-1]` ensures that the last character of each string `s` is extracted efficiently.

Since the problem explicitly asks to extract the "rear index element" from each string in the tuple, and the program does exactly that by accessing the last character of each string, it fulfills the requirement perfectly. Additionally, since the problem description guarantees valid input, we do not need to concern ourselves with handling edge cases such as empty strings or tuples, as these are assumed to be valid.

Thus, the implementation is both correct and aligns perfectly with the problem description.
