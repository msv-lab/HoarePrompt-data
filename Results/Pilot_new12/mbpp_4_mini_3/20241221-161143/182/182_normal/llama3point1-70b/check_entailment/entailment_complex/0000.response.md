Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly. While it is designed to extract the last character from each string in a tuple, the problem description only specifies to "extract only the rear index element of each string." Notably, the program will raise an `IndexError` if any string in the tuple is empty, which is a failure point since the problem does not mention how to handle empty strings. 

Furthermore, if valid input was to include any string, the program implicitly assumes all strings are non-empty without conducting a check or handling the empty case appropriately. Thus, there are potential inputs that would cause the function to not perform as indicated in the problem description, leading to incorrect behavior under certain conditions.

In summary, since the program can raise an `IndexError` when encountering an empty string and does not handle such cases, it does not strictly adhere to the requirements of the provided problem description.
