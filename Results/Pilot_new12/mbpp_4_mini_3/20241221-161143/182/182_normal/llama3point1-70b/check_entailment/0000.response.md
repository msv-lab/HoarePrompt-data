Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly extracts the last character (the rear index element) of each string in the given tuple. It utilizes a list comprehension which efficiently iterates through each string in the input tuple `strings` and retrieves the last character using indexing `s[-1]`. This implementation will work for normal strings, and if the input consists of empty strings in the tuple, it will raise an `IndexError`, which would be an edge case not handled. However, since empty strings are strings, and accessing an index of an empty string is part of standard behavior, for non-empty strings, it will function correctly for all valid input where strings are not empty. Since the problem description does not indicate handling of empty strings or throwing specific exceptions, and valid inputs are presumed, the implementation fits the brief as correct.
