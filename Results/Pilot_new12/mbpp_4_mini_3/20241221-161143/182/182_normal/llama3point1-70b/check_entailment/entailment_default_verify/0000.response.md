Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but it overlooked critical aspects highlighted by the output hints. While the function does correctly extract the last character of each string in a tuple, it does not handle empty strings, which will raise an `IndexError`. The problem description does not specify that the function should handle empty strings, but given that the output hints emphasize the potential for errors when encountering them, the conclusion is that the program does not meet the robustness expected for varying inputs, in particular with empty strings.

Additionally, the function lacks type-checking, meaning if someone were to provide non-string elements in the tuple, the behavior would be undefined. This adds to the argument that the program is not fully correct as it does not handle all edge cases as implied by valid assumptions about input. Thus, the original assessment does not account for these critical issues and is inaccurate.
