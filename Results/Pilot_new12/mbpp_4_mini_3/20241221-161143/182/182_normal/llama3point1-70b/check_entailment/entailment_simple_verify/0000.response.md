Final: **True**

The program accurately meets the problem description, which states that the goal is to extract the last character of each string in a given tuple. The original assessment correctly points out that the list comprehension efficiently retrieves the last character using indexing, which works for valid non-empty strings.

The annotations further validate that the function operates as intended by stating, "The program returns a list of the last characters from each string in the tuple 'strings'." Given that the assessment assumes valid inputs and the annotated state reflects the programâ€™s intent and functionality accurately, the original assessment of correctness remains valid. Thus, the program is correct as per the specifications of the problem description.
