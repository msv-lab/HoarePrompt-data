Final: **False**

The original assessment stated the program's correctness as **True**, assuming the input strings would be non-empty and valid. However, the annotated version highlights a critical flaw: the program does not handle empty strings properly. If any string in the tuple is empty, accessing `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError`. This flaw contradicts the problem description, which presumes robust behavior even with edge cases. Hence, the assessment of correctness in the original evaluation is inaccurate because a fundamental requirement — handling empty strings — is not met, making the program incorrect for all possible cases.
