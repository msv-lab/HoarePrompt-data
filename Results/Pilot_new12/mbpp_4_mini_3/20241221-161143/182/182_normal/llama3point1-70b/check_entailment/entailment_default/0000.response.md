Explanation: The code is intended to extract the last character from each string in a given tuple. However, the output hints indicate that if any string in the tuple is empty, an `IndexError` will occur because the code tries to access the last character of each string without checking if the string is empty. This means that the code does not handle potential edge cases where the input might not be valid (e.g., empty strings in the tuple), which leads to an exception being raised. Furthermore, the function assumes that the input will always be a tuple of strings and does not perform any checks to verify that, which can result in undefined behavior if the input is not as expected.

Since the program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case, such as when encountering an empty string, the correctness is affected.

Correctness: **False**.
