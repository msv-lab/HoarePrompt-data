Correctness: **False**

The program does not work as expected for multiple potential cases. Specifically, if any string in the input tuple is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access the last character. The absence of a check for empty strings means that the function does not handle this scenario correctly, which directly violates the requirement of extracting the last character safely. Additionally, if the input is not a tuple or contains non-string elements, the behavior is also undefined as there is no type-checking implemented. 

For example, calling `func_1(())` should ideally return an empty list `[]` rather than throwing an error, and calling `func_1(('abc', '', 'def'))` would raise an `IndexError`, demonstrating incorrect handling of inputs as per the problem description. These cases show the function does not meet the requirements in all situations.
