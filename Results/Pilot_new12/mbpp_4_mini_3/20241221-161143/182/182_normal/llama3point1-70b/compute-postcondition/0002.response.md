Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `strings`, which is a tuple of strings, and returns a list of the last characters from each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the last character of each string without checking for emptiness. Additionally, if the input is not a tuple or contains non-string elements, the behavior is undefined as the function does not include any type-checking or error handling.**
