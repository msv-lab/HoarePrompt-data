The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter, `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It calculates and returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and minimum value in the list. Specifically, it finds the minimum value (`min_val`) and maximum value (`max_val`) in the list, computes the difference as `max_diff = max_val - min_val`, and returns this difference. However, the function does not handle edge cases such as when `arr` is empty, which would raise an error since `min()` and `max()` cannot operate on an empty sequence. Additionally, if all elements in `arr` are the same, the function will return zero, as `max_diff` would be zero. These cases are important to note as they affect the robustness of the function.
