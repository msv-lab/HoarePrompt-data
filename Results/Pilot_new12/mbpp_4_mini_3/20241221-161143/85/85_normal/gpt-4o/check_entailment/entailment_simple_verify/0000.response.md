Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate based on the problem description and annotations. The program successfully calculates the maximum difference between any two integers in a given array by finding the maximum and minimum values and returning their difference. 

The provided assertions confirm that the program behaves as expected for various scenarios, including normal, descending, and already sorted arrays. The annotations clearly state that the function correctly processes the input and performs the necessary calculations. Since all examined situations align with the problem requirements and the output is as expected, the assessment remains unchanged. The program is thus correctly implemented according to the specifications given in the problem description.
