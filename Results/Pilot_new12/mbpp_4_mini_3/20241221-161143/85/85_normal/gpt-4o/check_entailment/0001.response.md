Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the task of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. The function `func_1(arr)` takes an array (or tuple) of numbers as input.
2. It computes the minimum value in the array using `min(arr)`.
3. It computes the maximum value in the array using `max(arr)`.
4. The maximum difference is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value: `max_val - min_val`.
5. The function returns this difference.

The assertions provided in the program serve as tests that verify the correctness of the function with different input scenarios:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the difference between 5 (max) and 1 (min) is indeed 4.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the difference between 9 (max) and 1 (min) is indeed 8.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the difference between 3 (max) and 1 (min) is indeed 2.

Additionally, there are no edge cases in the provided problem description that are not handled by the function:
- It correctly calculates the maximum difference even if the array contains negative numbers.
- The implementation would also effectively handle cases where the array has only two elements, as it would still compute the difference correctly.

Given that all tested cases are correct and the function properly implements the logic required to find the maximum difference, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential input cases discussed. Hence, the correctness is affirmed as True.
