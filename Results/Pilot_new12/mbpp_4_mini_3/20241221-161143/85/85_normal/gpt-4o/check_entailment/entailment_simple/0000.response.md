Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` which takes a list of integers (which can be derived from the given tuples in the assertions). 

Here's how the program meets the described requirements:

1. **Finding Maximum and Minimum**: The function computes the minimum (`min_val`) and maximum (`max_val`) values from the input array `arr`. This is essential to determine the maximum difference, as specified.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Difference**: The program calculates the maximum difference by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value (`max_diff = max_val - min_val`).

3. **Returning the Result**: The computed maximum difference is returned, which adheres to the requirements of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

4. **Validation with Assertions**: The assertions given test cases confirm that the function produces the expected output for various inputs. For example:
   - For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum difference is correctly calculated as `5 - 1 = 4`.
   - For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
   - For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Since the function reliably computes the maximum difference as outlined in the problem description and passes all provided tests without exception, it can be stated that the program fulfills the required criteria accurately. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
