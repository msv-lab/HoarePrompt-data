You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the task of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. The function `func_1(arr)` takes an array (or tuple) of numbers as input.
2. It computes the minimum value in the array using `min(arr)`.
3. It computes the maximum value in the array using `max(arr)`.
4. The maximum difference is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value: `max_val - min_val`.
5. The function returns this difference.

The assertions provided in the program serve as tests that verify the correctness of the function with different input scenarios:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the difference between 5 (max) and 1 (min) is indeed 4.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the difference between 9 (max) and 1 (min) is indeed 8.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the difference between 3 (max) and 1 (min) is indeed 2.

Additionally, there are no edge cases in the provided problem description that are not handled by the function:
- It correctly calculates the maximum difference even if the array contains negative numbers.
- The implementation would also effectively handle cases where the array has only two elements, as it would still compute the difference correctly.

Given that all tested cases are correct and the function properly implements the logic required to find the maximum difference, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential input cases discussed. Hence, the correctness is affirmed as True.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the maximum difference between the maximum value `max_val` and the minimum value `min_val` in the list `arr`, where `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter, `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It calculates and returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and minimum value in the list. Specifically, it finds the minimum value (`min_val`) and maximum value (`max_val`) in the list, computes the difference as `max_diff = max_val - min_val`, and returns this difference. However, the function does not handle edge cases such as when `arr` is empty, which would raise an error since `min()` and `max()` cannot operate on an empty sequence. Additionally, if all elements in `arr` are the same, the function will return zero, as `max_diff` would be zero. These cases are important to note as they affect the robustness of the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
