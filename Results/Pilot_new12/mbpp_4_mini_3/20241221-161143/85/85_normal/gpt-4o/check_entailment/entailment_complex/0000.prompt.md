You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the maximum difference between the maximum value `max_val` and the minimum value `min_val` in the list `arr`, where `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter, `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It calculates and returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and minimum value in the list. Specifically, it finds the minimum value (`min_val`) and maximum value (`max_val`) in the list, computes the difference as `max_diff = max_val - min_val`, and returns this difference. However, the function does not handle edge cases such as when `arr` is empty, which would raise an error since `min()` and `max()` cannot operate on an empty sequence. Additionally, if all elements in `arr` are the same, the function will return zero, as `max_diff` would be zero. These cases are important to note as they affect the robustness of the function.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
