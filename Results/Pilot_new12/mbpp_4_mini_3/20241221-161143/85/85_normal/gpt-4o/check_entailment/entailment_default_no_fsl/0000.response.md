Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases described in the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the case when the input array `arr` is empty. When `arr` is empty, both `min()` and `max()` will raise a `ValueError` since they cannot operate on an empty sequence. This would result in the program crashing, which means it does not satisfy the requirement to find the maximum difference for every potential input case. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description comprehensively, leading to an incorrect classification.
