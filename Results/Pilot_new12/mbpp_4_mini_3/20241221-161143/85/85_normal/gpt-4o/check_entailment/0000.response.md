Correctness: **True**.

The given program successfully finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does this by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This approach correctly handles multiple scenarios, including:

1. **General Case**: For an array like (2, 1, 5, 3), the minimum is 1 and the maximum is 5, giving a difference of 4, which is correctly returned.
2. **Descending Order**: For an array like (9, 3, 2, 5, 1), the output is 8 because 9 (max) - 1 (min) = 8, which is also correctly returned.
3. **Already Sorted in Ascending Order**: For an array like (3, 2, 1), the max is 3 and the min is 1, hence the difference is 2, which is confirmed to be correct.

Additionally, the program handles edge cases such as arrays with duplicates or where all elements are the same (e.g., (1, 1, 1)), where the difference would rightly be 0. Since there are no potential cases where the program does not meet the requirement as specified in the problem description, it is determined to be correct.
