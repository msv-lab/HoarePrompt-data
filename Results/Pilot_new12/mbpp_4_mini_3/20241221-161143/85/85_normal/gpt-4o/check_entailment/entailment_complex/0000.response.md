Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description which asks for the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

Here's why the function is correct:

1. **Inputs**: The function accepts a single parameter, `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers.

2. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**: 
   - It correctly calculates the minimum value using `min(arr)` and the maximum value using `max(arr)`.
   - This ensures that the calculation of the maximum difference is based on the correct values present in the input list.

3. **Calculating the Difference**: 
   - The function computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values as `max_diff = max_val - min_val`.
   - This represents the maximum difference between any two elements in the list, as per the problem description.

4. **Returning the Result**: 
   - It returns this difference value, thus fulfilling the functional requirement.

5. **Robustness Assumption**: 
   - The function assumes valid input as stated. While it does not handle edge cases such as an empty list or identical elements, the correctness is evaluated based on the assumption that inputs will be valid and thus will not lead to errors.

Therefore, since the function correctly calculates the maximum difference as per the problem description under the defined assumptions about input validity, it is deemed correct.
