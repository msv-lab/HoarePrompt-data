Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations. The function `func_1` effectively computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the minimum and maximum values and calculating their difference. 

The annotations confirm that at the point of function execution, the input is a list of integers, which aligns with the expected behavior of the function. The various test cases provided demonstrate that the function successfully returns the correct maximum differences: 

1. For input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the output is `4`, which is correct.
2. For `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the output is `8`, also correct.
3. For `(3, 2, 1)`, the output is `2`.

The annotated concerns regarding edge cases (empty array and all elements being the same) are acknowledged, but since the context specifies that inputs provided to the function will always be valid according to the problem description, it does not detract from the correctness of the program in accordance with the stated requirements.

Overall, the program meets the problem's requirements, and the original assessment stands valid.
