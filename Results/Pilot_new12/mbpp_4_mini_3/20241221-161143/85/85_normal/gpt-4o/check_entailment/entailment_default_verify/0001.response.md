The provided program `func_1` accurately calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array (or tuple) by determining the minimum and maximum values and returning their difference. The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **True**, which I maintained until assessing the output hints.

However, the output hints highlighted significant issues that affect the robustness of the function:
1. The function does not handle the case where the input list (`arr`) is empty. In Python, calling `min()` or `max()` on an empty sequence will raise a `ValueError`, which is a critical flaw since the function may encounter such input.
2. If all elements in `arr` are the same, the function will return zero, which is contextually correct but might not be aligned with the typical understanding of "maximum difference" in certain situations (though this is more a matter of expectation than correctness).

Taking these output hints into account, it is clear that the function does not cater to all edge cases effectively, particularly the empty input scenario. Due to this oversight, I conclude that the program cannot be considered completely correct.

Final: **False**
