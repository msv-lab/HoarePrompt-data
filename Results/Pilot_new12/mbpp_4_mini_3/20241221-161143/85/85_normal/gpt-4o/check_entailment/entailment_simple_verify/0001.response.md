Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately evaluates the correctness of the program. The provided function `func_1` successfully calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, as specified in the problem description. 

The annotated version confirms that:
1. The input `arr` is indeed a list of integers at the point of function call.
2. The calculations for `min_val`, `max_val`, and subsequently `max_diff` are executed correctly, aligning with the intended functionality of finding the maximum difference.

All assertions in the program verify that the function performs as expected across various test cases â€” confirming the difference between maximum and minimum values is correctly computed. The presence of valid input is also a given assumption for this evaluation, which reinforces the correctness of the program.

Thus, both the original assessment and the annotations substantiate that the function works as intended in accordance with the problem description.
