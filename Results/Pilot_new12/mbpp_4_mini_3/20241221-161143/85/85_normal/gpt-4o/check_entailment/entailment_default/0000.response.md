The provided program correctly implements a function that finds the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum elements in a given array. The logic used in the function involves calculating the minimum and maximum values from the list and subtracting the minimum from the maximum.

However, the output hints note that the function does not handle the edge case of an empty input array (`arr`), which would raise an error when trying to compute the minimum and maximum of an empty sequence. This means that the function would fail if such an input were provided, therefore not meeting the problem description requirements for every potential case.

While one might argue that we assume valid input, the problem description does not explicitly state that inputs will always be valid or that the edge case of an empty list is irrelevant. Since the program does not account for this scenario, we must conclude that it does not fulfill the problem's requirements comprehensively.

Correctness: **False**.
