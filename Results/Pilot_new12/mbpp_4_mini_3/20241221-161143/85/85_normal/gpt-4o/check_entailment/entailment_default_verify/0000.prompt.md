You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program successfully finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does this by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This approach correctly handles multiple scenarios, including:

1. **General Case**: For an array like (2, 1, 5, 3), the minimum is 1 and the maximum is 5, giving a difference of 4, which is correctly returned.
2. **Descending Order**: For an array like (9, 3, 2, 5, 1), the output is 8 because 9 (max) - 1 (min) = 8, which is also correctly returned.
3. **Already Sorted in Ascending Order**: For an array like (3, 2, 1), the max is 3 and the min is 1, hence the difference is 2, which is confirmed to be correct.

Additionally, the program handles edge cases such as arrays with duplicates or where all elements are the same (e.g., (1, 1, 1)), where the difference would rightly be 0. Since there are no potential cases where the program does not meet the requirement as specified in the problem description, it is determined to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter, `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It calculates and returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and minimum value in the list. Specifically, it finds the minimum value (`min_val`) and maximum value (`max_val`) in the list, computes the difference as `max_diff = max_val - min_val`, and returns this difference. However, the function does not handle edge cases such as when `arr` is empty, which would raise an error since `min()` and `max()` cannot operate on an empty sequence. Additionally, if all elements in `arr` are the same, the function will return zero, as `max_diff` would be zero. These cases are important to note as they affect the robustness of the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
