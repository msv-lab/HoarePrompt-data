The variable `max_val` is assigned the value of the maximum number found in the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, and `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`.**
