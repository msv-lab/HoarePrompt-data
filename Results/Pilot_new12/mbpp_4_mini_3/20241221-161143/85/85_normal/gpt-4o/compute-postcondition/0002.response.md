The variable `max_diff` is assigned the value of `max_val - min_val`. The values of `min_val` and `max_val` are determined by the contents of `arr`, which is a list of integers. The actual values of `max_val` and `min_val` are unknown but `max_diff` will be a non-negative integer since `max_val` is the maximum value and `min_val` is the minimum value in the list. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`, and `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`, `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.**
