Final: **False**

The program does not handle the case of an empty list correctly, as it would raise a `ValueError` when attempting to compute `max()` and `min()` on it. The problem description requires a function that finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, which implies functionality for all valid inputs. While the original assessment correctly states that the program works for non-empty lists of integers, it fails to consider the input constraints fully, including the empty list scenario. Since an empty input leads to an error rather than a valid output, it does not meet the problem's requirements comprehensively.
