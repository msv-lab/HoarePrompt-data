The code provided correctly implements the function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by using the expressions `max(arr)` and `min(arr)`. According to the output hints, the function does return the expected result that is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. However, the hints correctly outline that an empty list would raise a `ValueError` since `max()` and `min()` cannot operate on an empty list. 

Since the function does not handle the case of an empty list and will throw an error, this means that the function does not work correctly for **every potential case** as mentioned in the problem description. Although it assumes valid inputs, the program doesn't implement checks or error handling that would ensure robustness, particularly against empty lists.

Thus, the program is not universally correct.

Correctness: **False**.
