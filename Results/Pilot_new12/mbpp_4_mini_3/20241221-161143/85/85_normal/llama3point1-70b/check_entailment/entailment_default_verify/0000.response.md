Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the edge case of an empty list, which would result in a `ValueError` when attempting to call `max()` or `min()` on it. According to the problem description, the function should correctly find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array; however, if that array is empty, it fundamentally fails since there are no elements to compare. The output hints further confirm this by stating that the function will raise a `ValueError` when the list is empty, underscoring the fact that it does not fulfill the requirements as outlined in the problem description.
