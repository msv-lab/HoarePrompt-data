Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the program's correctness is **True** is accurate. The given function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in an array by returning the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This behavior adheres to the problem description, which requires finding the maximum difference.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program is designed to work with a list of integers and accurately describes the expected output. The acknowledgment that the program will raise a `ValueError` for an empty list is valid, but the assumption is made that the input to the program will always be valid based on the problem conditions provided. 

Furthermore, the function will produce correct results for non-empty lists, as demonstrated by the various test scenarios mentioned in the original assessment. Since there is no evidence of incorrect behavior for valid inputs, I conclude that the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Thus, the final determination of correctness remains **True**.
