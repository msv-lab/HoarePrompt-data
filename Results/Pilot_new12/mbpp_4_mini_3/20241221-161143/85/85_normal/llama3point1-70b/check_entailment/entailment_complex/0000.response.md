Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and correctly computes the maximum difference between two elements by subtracting the minimum value in the list from the maximum value. This directly addresses the problem statement's requirement.

2. **Behavior with Valid Inputs**: Under the assumption provided that the input will always be valid (a list of integers and never empty), the program will always successfully compute the desired output â€“ the maximum difference.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: While the annotations note that the function does not handle cases of empty lists, non-integer values, or non-list inputs, the assumption that the input will always be valid means these edge cases are not a concern for our verification.

4. **Output Consistency**: The function serves the intended purpose of finding the maximum difference based on the inputted list, and the way it accomplishes this aligns with the logical requirement of the task.

Overall, since the function adheres to the stated problem description under the assumptions given, it is considered correct.
