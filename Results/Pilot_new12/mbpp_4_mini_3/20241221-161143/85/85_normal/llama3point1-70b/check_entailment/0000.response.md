Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not account for the case when the input array `arr` is empty. In such a scenario, calling `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` will raise a `ValueError` since there are no elements to derive a maximum or minimum from. According to the problem description, the function should be able to handle finding the maximum difference between any two elements, but an empty list does not have two elements, leading to a failure in the program. 

Thus, the function does not correctly address all potential input cases, specifically the edge case of an empty array.
