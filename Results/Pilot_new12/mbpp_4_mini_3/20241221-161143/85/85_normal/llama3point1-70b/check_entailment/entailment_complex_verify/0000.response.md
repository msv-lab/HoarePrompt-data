Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not handle the case of an empty input array. According to the problem description, the function is expected to find the maximum difference between any two elements, which cannot be performed if there are no elements in the input list. The annotations confirm that calling `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError`, thereby illustrating that the function does not correctly address all potential input cases, particularly the edge case of an empty array. Hence, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
