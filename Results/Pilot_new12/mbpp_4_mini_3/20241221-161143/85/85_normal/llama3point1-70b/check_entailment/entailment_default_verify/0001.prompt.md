You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in an array by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This aligns with the problem description, which requires finding the maximum difference.

To validate this, let's consider a few scenarios:

1. For an input array `[1, 2, 3]`, the max is `3` and the min is `1`, resulting in a difference of `2`.
2. For an input array `[-1, 0, 1]`, the max is `1` and the min is `-1`, resulting in a difference of `2`.
3. For an input array `[5, 5, 5]`, where all elements are the same, the difference should be `0`, aligning with the expectation that the maximum difference is still valid.
4. An empty array should raise an error since `max()` and `min()` cannot be called on it.

The only limitation in the code occurs with an empty input array, which would raise a `ValueError` due to the use of `max()` and `min()` functions on it. However, based solely on the problem's description about calculating the maximum difference, for non-empty arrays the program functions correctly.

Since we do not have any example of a non-empty input producing an incorrect result, I conclude that the function is correct for valid inputs. Thus, the final determination of correctness is True.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in that list. If the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` because `max()` and `min()` cannot be performed on an empty list. This function does not handle cases where `arr` contains non-integer values or is not a list at all, which could lead to additional runtime errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
