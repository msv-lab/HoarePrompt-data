Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the output hints. Specifically, it does not manage the scenario where the input list is empty, which raises a `ValueError` due to the use of `max()` and `min()` functions. An empty list is a valid potential input that could occur based on the problem description, thus making the program incorrect by not accounting for it. Additionally, the program does not handle non-integer values which could also lead to runtime errors. Therefore, since the program fails in at least one possible case, it does not meet the correctness criteria.
