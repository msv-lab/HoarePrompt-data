Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(arr)` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The goal of the problem is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The program accomplishes this by calculating the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the array using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions.

Reasons why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Max and Min Calculation**: By using `max(arr)`, the function retrieves the highest element in the array, and `min(arr)` retrieves the lowest element. The difference between these two values represents the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the list.

2. **Valid Input Assumption**: As per the instructions, we are assuming that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of integers). Since the function relies on this assumption, it will return the correct maximum difference under the conditions specified.

3. **Efficiency**: This implementation is efficient in terms of time complexity (O(n)) since it only passes through the list a couple of times to find the maximum and minimum.

Overall, the program fulfills the requirement to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the provided array, thus it is correct in its functionality as per the problem description.
