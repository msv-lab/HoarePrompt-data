Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided program correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in a valid input array of integers. The annotations confirm that at the moment before the function call, the input is indeed a list of integers, which aligns with the assumptions made in the assessment. The function directly computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in this list, showcasing its correctness as per the problem description.

All test scenarios mentioned in the original assessment validate that, for valid inputs (non-empty lists of integers), the function produces the correct maximum difference. Thus, based on the annotated version and the original assessment's reasoning, the conclusion remains that the program is correct for the intended purpose of finding the maximum difference in a provided list of integers.
