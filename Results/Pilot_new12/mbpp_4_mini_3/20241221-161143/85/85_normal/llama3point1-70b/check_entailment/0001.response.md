Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in an array by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This aligns with the problem description, which requires finding the maximum difference.

To validate this, let's consider a few scenarios:

1. For an input array `[1, 2, 3]`, the max is `3` and the min is `1`, resulting in a difference of `2`.
2. For an input array `[-1, 0, 1]`, the max is `1` and the min is `-1`, resulting in a difference of `2`.
3. For an input array `[5, 5, 5]`, where all elements are the same, the difference should be `0`, aligning with the expectation that the maximum difference is still valid.
4. An empty array should raise an error since `max()` and `min()` cannot be called on it.

The only limitation in the code occurs with an empty input array, which would raise a `ValueError` due to the use of `max()` and `min()` functions on it. However, based solely on the problem's description about calculating the maximum difference, for non-empty arrays the program functions correctly.

Since we do not have any example of a non-empty input producing an incorrect result, I conclude that the function is correct for valid inputs. Thus, the final determination of correctness is True.
