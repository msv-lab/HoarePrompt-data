The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in that list. If the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` because `max()` and `min()` cannot be performed on an empty list. This function does not handle cases where `arr` contains non-integer values or is not a list at all, which could lead to additional runtime errors.
