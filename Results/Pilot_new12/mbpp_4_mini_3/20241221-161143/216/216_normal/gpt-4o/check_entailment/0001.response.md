Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input list contains negative numbers. For example, the input `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]` would return `False`, but these numbers do form a consecutive sequence when considering the numbers in the entire range. The function only checks the order of positive integers and fails to account for negative values and zero, which may lead to incorrect results. Thus, it does not meet the problem description requirements for every potential case.
