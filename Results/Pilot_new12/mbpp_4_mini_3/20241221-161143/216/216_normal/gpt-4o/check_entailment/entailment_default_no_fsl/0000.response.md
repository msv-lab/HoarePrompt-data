Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the presence of duplicate integers in the input list, which can affect the determination of whether the integers are consecutive. For example, the input `[1, 2, 2, 3]` should return `False` because the presence of the duplicate `2` indicates that there are not unique consecutive numbers, yet the function would incorrectly return `True` as it would evaluate the gaps and find none. This oversight means that the function does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description for every potential case.
