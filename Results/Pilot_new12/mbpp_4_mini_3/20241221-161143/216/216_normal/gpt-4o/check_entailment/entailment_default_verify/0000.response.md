Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle cases with duplicates or negative numbers. According to the output hints and the problem description, the function should ensure that only unique, consecutive integers are considered as valid input. The presence of duplicates means that the elements cannot be strictly consecutive, leading to incorrect results. For instance, the input `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` should return `False`, but the current implementation would return `True`. Additionally, when assessing negative integers, the function does not accurately capture the requirement for consecutive integers as specified. Therefore, the program does not meet the necessary conditions outlined in the problem description, confirming that it is incorrect.
