You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the list `lst` is empty and contains no elements.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not an empty list.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of consecutive integers. The loop will fully execute if `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements, and there are no gaps between consecutive integers in `lst_sorted`. If the list has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `lst_sorted` contains the same elements as `lst`.
    return True
    #The program returns True if lst_sorted has at least 2 elements and contains no gaps between consecutive integers. If lst_sorted has less than 2 elements, it returns True because the loop does not execute and lst_sorted contains the same elements as lst.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It returns False if the list is empty or if there are gaps between consecutive integers in the sorted version of the list. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, it returns True since there can be no gaps to evaluate. If the sorted list has at least 2 elements and there are no gaps between consecutive integers, it returns True. Additionally, it does not handle the presence of duplicate integers in the input list, which could also affect the determination of consecutive integers; this is a potential oversight in its functionality. Overall, the function checks for gaps between integers and evaluates the consecutive nature of the integer list while addressing edge cases related to the list's length.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
