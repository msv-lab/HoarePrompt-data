The provided Python function `func_1` aims to verify whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. Now, let's analyze the program in conjunction with the output hints and consider different scenarios to determine its correctness.

1. **Functionality Check**:
   - The function first checks if the list is empty and returns `False`.
   - It sorts the list and then verifies whether each consecutive number (in the sorted list) has an absolute difference of 1, indicating they are consecutive.
   - The function returns `True` if all consecutive elements meet this criterion.

2. **Evaluation of Examples**:
   - The assertions provided test various scenarios:
     - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output is `True` (correct).
     - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`, the output is `False` (correct, since there's a gap between 3 and 5).
     - For the input `[1, 2, 1]`, the output is `False` (correct, as it checks for distinct consecutive numbers).

3. **Output Hints Analysis**:
   - The hints underscore that the function evaluates gaps between integers and takes care of the list's length. However, it mentions a potential oversight regarding handling duplicate integers.
   - The current implementation does not account for duplicates; thus, a list like `[1, 2, 2, 3]` will incorrectly return `True`, despite it containing non-distinct elements.

4. **Identifying Issue**:
   - An important edge case arises with lists containing duplicates or non-distinct integers. For instance, given `lst = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, the function would return `True`, while it contradicts the problem description, which implies a check for consecutive numbers should consider uniqueness.

Given this analysis, the program does not align with the original problem description in every potential case, particularly regarding how it handles duplicates in the input list.

Correctness: **False**.
