Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description, as it fails to accurately determine whether the given list contains consecutive numbers for all possible scenarios. 

1. The program sorts the list and checks for gaps between numbers. This is a correct approach for determining consecutive numbers.
2. However, there is an issue with the case where the list contains a single number. According to the problem description, a list containing a single number (e.g., `[1]`) should technically be interpreted as having consecutive numbers, as there's no other number to compare it to.
3. The implementation currently returns `True` for lists with less than two elements (including the empty list), which is misleading because an empty list should return `False`, and a single-element list should logically return `True`.

Thus, since the implementation does not correctly handle all edge cases related to the definition of "consecutive numbers," it does not satisfy the problem description completely.
