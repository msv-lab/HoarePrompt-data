Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to handle the case where the list contains negative or duplicate numbers properly. For instance, if the input list is `[-1, 0, 1, 2]`, it incorrectly returns `True` because when sorted, it gives `[ -1, 0, 1, 2]` and the differences between consecutive elements are not equal to 1, which should result in `False`. Another case is if the input is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, it would also incorrectly return `True`, when it should return `False` because consecutive unique elements are required. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements for all potential cases and is incorrect.
