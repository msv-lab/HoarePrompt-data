You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to handle the case where the list contains negative or duplicate numbers properly. For instance, if the input list is `[-1, 0, 1, 2]`, it incorrectly returns `True` because when sorted, it gives `[ -1, 0, 1, 2]` and the differences between consecutive elements are not equal to 1, which should result in `False`. Another case is if the input is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, it would also incorrectly return `True`, when it should return `False` because consecutive unique elements are required. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements for all potential cases and is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the list `lst` is empty and contains no elements.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not an empty list.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of consecutive integers. The loop will fully execute if `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements, and there are no gaps between consecutive integers in `lst_sorted`. If the list has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `lst_sorted` contains the same elements as `lst`.
    return True
    #The program returns True if lst_sorted has at least 2 elements and contains no gaps between consecutive integers. If lst_sorted has less than 2 elements, it returns True because the loop does not execute and lst_sorted contains the same elements as lst.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It returns False if the list is empty or if there are gaps between consecutive integers in the sorted version of the list. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, it returns True since there can be no gaps to evaluate. If the sorted list has at least 2 elements and there are no gaps between consecutive integers, it returns True. Additionally, it does not handle the presence of duplicate integers in the input list, which could also affect the determination of consecutive integers; this is a potential oversight in its functionality. Overall, the function checks for gaps between integers and evaluates the consecutive nature of the integer list while addressing edge cases related to the list's length.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
