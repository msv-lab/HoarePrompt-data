Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description because it fails to handle the presence of duplicate integers in the input list. According to the problem description, the function should check whether the list contains consecutive numbers. However, if the input list contains duplicates (e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3]`), the current implementation will incorrectly return `True` since it does not account for duplicates.

In more detail, the logic of the function sorts the list and checks if every consecutive element differs by 1. If duplicates are present, this condition can still be satisfied, even though the presence of duplicates means the integers are not truly consecutive.

For example, the input list `[1, 2, 2, 3]` would result in `[1, 2, 2, 3]` when sorted, and the gaps check would pass (because `2 - 1 = 1` and `3 - 2 = 1`), causing the function to erroneously return `True`. Thus, this oversight conflicts with the requirement of determining whether the list contains consecutive integers without duplicates.

Therefore, since the program fails in this scenario, it does not fulfill the problem description correctly.
