The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly handle the case where the input list contains negative numbers, specifically using the example of `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]` which it was claimed would incorrectly return `False`. This assertion is incorrect because the provided program, when given `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]`, would correctly sort the list and detect that it contains consecutive integers as all the pairs of adjacent numbers differ by exactly 1.

Additionally, the program correctly handles the scenarios provided in the assertions, returning `True` for a list with strictly consecutive integers and `False` for lists that do not meet that condition.

The annotated version confirms that:
1. The function checks for empty lists and returns `False`, which is correct behavior.
2. It sorts the list and verifies that adjacent sorted integers differ by 1, which effectively checks for consecutiveness.
3. It also notes the handling of lists with lengths fewer than 2, returning `True` as expected since they do not have gaps.

Despite the potential oversight regarding duplicates, the program still effectively meets the problem description by ensuring that each integer check occurs sequentially.

Based on this analysis, the original assertion about the program's correctness was unfounded. The program adheres to the problem description and handles the stated inputs properly, including those with negative numbers.

Final: **True**
