According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it 2, and `lst_sorted` must have at least 4 elements (since the length must be greater than `i + 1` to prevent an index out of range error).

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, i is 2**
