According to the code, the loop execution depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop will execute for `len(lst_sorted) - 1` iterations. For this loop to execute, `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than 1, meaning that `lst_sorted` must contain at least 2 elements. 

Before the loop starts, `lst` is a list of integers, which may have 0, 1, or more elements, and `lst_sorted` is its sorted version. The sorted version will only have elements if `lst` contains elements, and for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure `lst_sorted` has sufficient elements.

After considering these points, the necessary states to adjust are that `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements, and to track the loop's index, `i` starts at 0.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` must be a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
