The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function checks a series of conditions related to the elements of this list. 

- If `lst` is empty, the function returns `False`.
- If there are gaps between consecutive integers in the sorted version of `lst`, the function returns `False`.
- If `lst_sorted` has less than 2 elements, it returns `True` because there are no gaps to check.
- If `lst_sorted` contains at least 2 elements and has no gaps between consecutive integers, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and determine if it contains no gaps between consecutive integers or if it's an empty list, while also handling small list cases appropriately.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers. It returns False if the list is empty or if there are gaps between consecutive integers; otherwise, it returns True if the list has at least 2 elements with no gaps or if it contains less than 2 elements.**
