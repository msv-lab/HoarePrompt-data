Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of consecutive integers. The loop will fully execute if `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements, and there are no gaps between consecutive integers in `lst_sorted`. If the list has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `lst_sorted` contains the same elements as `lst`.**
