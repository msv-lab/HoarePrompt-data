According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop iterates from 0 to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements, `len(lst_sorted)` is at least 2.

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, the new value of `i` must still be less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. Therefore, `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1**
