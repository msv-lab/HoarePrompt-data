The variable `lst_sorted` is assigned the value of `sorted(lst)`, which is a sorted version of `lst`. Since `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` will be a new list that contains the same integers as `lst`, but in ascending order. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`**.
