You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the list `lst` is empty and contains no elements.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not an empty list.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of consecutive integers. The loop will fully execute if `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements, and there are no gaps between consecutive integers in `lst_sorted`. If the list has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `lst_sorted` contains the same elements as `lst`.
    return True
    #The program returns True if lst_sorted has at least 2 elements and contains no gaps between consecutive integers. If lst_sorted has less than 2 elements, it returns True because the loop does not execute and lst_sorted contains the same elements as lst.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers. It returns False if the list is empty or if there are gaps between consecutive integers; otherwise, it returns True if the list has at least 2 elements with no gaps or if it contains less than 2 elements.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False, indicating that the list `lst` is empty and contains no elements.

Case_2: The program returns False, indicating that the difference between the second element `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and the first element `lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1.

Case_3: The program returns False

Case_4: The program returns False

Case_5: The program returns True if lst_sorted has at least 2 elements and contains no gaps between consecutive integers. If lst_sorted has less than 2 elements, it returns True because the loop does not execute and lst_sorted contains the same elements as lst.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
