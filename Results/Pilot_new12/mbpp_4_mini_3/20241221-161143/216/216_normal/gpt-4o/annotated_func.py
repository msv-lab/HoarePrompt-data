#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the list `lst` is empty and contains no elements.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not an empty list.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of consecutive integers. The loop will fully execute if `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements, and there are no gaps between consecutive integers in `lst_sorted`. If the list has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `lst_sorted` contains the same elements as `lst`.
    return True
    #The program returns True if lst_sorted has at least 2 elements and contains no gaps between consecutive integers. If lst_sorted has less than 2 elements, it returns True because the loop does not execute and lst_sorted contains the same elements as lst.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It returns False if the list is empty or if there are gaps between consecutive integers in the sorted version of the list. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, it returns True since there can be no gaps to evaluate. If the sorted list has at least 2 elements and there are no gaps between consecutive integers, it returns True. Additionally, it does not handle the presence of duplicate integers in the input list, which could also affect the determination of consecutive integers; this is a potential oversight in its functionality. Overall, the function checks for gaps between integers and evaluates the consecutive nature of the integer list while addressing edge cases related to the list's length.
