The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It sorts the list and checks if all elements in the sorted list are consecutive integers with no duplicates. The function returns `True` if these conditions are met; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that if `lst` is empty, the function will also return `True`, since an empty list has no elements that violate the consecutive and uniqueness conditions. This behavior of treating an empty list as valid may not be clear from the annotations.
