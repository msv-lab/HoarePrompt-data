#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if all elements in the sorted list 'lst' are consecutive integers with no duplicates, false otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It sorts the list and checks if all elements in the sorted list are consecutive integers with no duplicates. The function returns `True` if these conditions are met; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that if `lst` is empty, the function will also return `True`, since an empty list has no elements that violate the consecutive and uniqueness conditions. This behavior of treating an empty list as valid may not be clear from the annotations.
