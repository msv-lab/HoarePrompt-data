The `sort()` method will sort the list `lst` in ascending order. The specific order will depend on the initial values of the integers in the list. Since the initial state specifies that `lst` is a list of integers but does not provide its specific contents, the output state can only describe it in general terms. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`lst` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.**
