Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly satisfy the problem description in certain cases. The problem description requires that the function checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. However, the annotated program has an issue regarding the treatment of an empty list.

According to the problem description, the function needs to check if a list contains consecutive numbers. When the function is called with an empty list, the current implementation will return `True`, which does not align with a logical interpretation of what "consecutive numbers" should be. An empty list should not be considered as having consecutive numbers, as there are no elements to indicate consecutiveness.

Additionally, the program correctly identifies if the sorted list consists of unique integers, but it fails to address the logical expectations around an empty list, thus making the program incorrect based on the problem requirements. The intended behavior should be clarified to potentially return `False` for an empty list.

Hence, the function does not consistently follow the requirements of the problem description, which leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
