You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program based on the provided problem description, we can analyze the logic of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description Analysis
The function is supposed to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. This typically means that for a list of numbers, after sorting, each number should differ from the next by exactly 1, and no number should be repeated.

### Program Logic Breakdown
- The function first sorts the list.
- Then it checks two conditions:
  1. The difference between each successive pair of elements in the sorted list is exactly 1.
  2. The length of the list should be the same as the length of the set of the list (to ensure there are no duplicates).

### Potential Issues
1. **Empty List**: An empty list is a case that is not explicitly covered. An empty list does not have any numbers, hence can be considered as not containing consecutive numbers.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with a single number (like `[5]`) does not have consecutive numbers, but it also could be argued it does not violate the consecutive requirement as there's nothing to compare against.
3. **Negative Numbers**: The logic does not address negative numbers. For example, a list like `[-2, -1, 0, 1]` contains consecutive 'numbers' but has a gap, so logically would not satisfy a condition checking for "consecutive" numbers.
4. **Diverse Range**: A list like `[1, 2, 3, 5]` will fail as it has a gap between 3 and 5. However, the program does check for this.

### Conclusion
Given these observations, especially noting that an empty list may produce an unintended true value because it does not break the condition (since there are no elements to contradict the definition of "consecutive"), the program fails to correctly handle this edge case by not returning false for an empty input.

Thus, we find a potential case where the program does not work correctly.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It sorts the list and checks if all elements in the sorted list are consecutive integers with no duplicates. The function returns `True` if these conditions are met; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that if `lst` is empty, the function will also return `True`, since an empty list has no elements that violate the consecutive and uniqueness conditions. This behavior of treating an empty list as valid may not be clear from the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
