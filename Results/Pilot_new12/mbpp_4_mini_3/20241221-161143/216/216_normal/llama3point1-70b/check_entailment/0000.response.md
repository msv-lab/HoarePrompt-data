To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze if it correctly checks for consecutive numbers in a given list according to the problem description.

### Problem description
We need to check if a provided list contains consecutive numbers. This implies that the numbers in the list should follow one another without any gaps.

### Program Analysis
The function implementation does the following:
1. It sorts the given list.
2. It checks two conditions:
   - The difference between each consecutive pair of numbers is exactly 1.
   - The length of the list remains the same as the length of the set of the list (to ensure there are no duplicate numbers).

### Potential Problems
- If the list is empty, the function will return `True`, but an empty list should likely be treated as not containing consecutive numbers.
- If the list contains just one element, the function will return `True`, which might not be the expected behavior since a single number cannot be considered "consecutive" by itself.
- If the list contains negative numbers or numbers that are not integers, this program might yield unexpected results outside the intended range of natural numbers.

### Test Cases
1. **Empty list**: `func_1([])` → should return `False`, but the code would return `True`.
2. **Single element**: `func_1([5])` → should return `False`, but the code would return `True`.
3. **Regular case**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4])` → returns `True` as expected.
4. **Non-consecutive numbers**: `func_1([1, 2, 4])` → returns `False` as expected.
5. **With duplicates**: `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3])` → returns `False` as expected.
6. **Negative numbers**: `func_1([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1])` → returns `False`, which might be incorrect as `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]` technically has sequences -3 to -2, -2 to -1, -1 to 0, and 0 to 1, but they are not just a singular consecutive series.

### Conclusion
Considering the above points, the program does not correctly handle edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the stated problem requirement is:

Correctness: **False**.
