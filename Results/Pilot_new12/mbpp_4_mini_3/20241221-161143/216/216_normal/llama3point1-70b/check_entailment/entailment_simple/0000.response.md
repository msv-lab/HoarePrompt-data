Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers as stated in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Sorting**: The list is sorted to arrange the numbers in increasing order. This ensures that when we check for consecutive elements, we are comparing them in the correct sequence.

2. **Consecutiveness Check**: The expression `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between each consecutive element is exactly 1. This ensures that the numbers are consecutive.

3. **Duplicate Check**: The condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` checks for duplicates in the list. Using a set automatically removes any duplicate values, so if the length of the set is less than the original list, it indicates there are duplicate numbers.

4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns True only if both conditions (consecutiveness and no duplicates) are satisfied. This directly aligns with the requirement to determine if the list contains consecutive numbers.

Thus, the program correctly implements the functionality as described, and adheres to the conditions outlined in the problem description under all valid scenarios.
