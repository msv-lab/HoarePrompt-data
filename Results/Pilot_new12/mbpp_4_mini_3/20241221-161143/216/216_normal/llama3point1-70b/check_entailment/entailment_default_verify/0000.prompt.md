You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze if it correctly checks for consecutive numbers in a given list according to the problem description.

### Problem description
We need to check if a provided list contains consecutive numbers. This implies that the numbers in the list should follow one another without any gaps.

### Program Analysis
The function implementation does the following:
1. It sorts the given list.
2. It checks two conditions:
   - The difference between each consecutive pair of numbers is exactly 1.
   - The length of the list remains the same as the length of the set of the list (to ensure there are no duplicate numbers).

### Potential Problems
- If the list is empty, the function will return `True`, but an empty list should likely be treated as not containing consecutive numbers.
- If the list contains just one element, the function will return `True`, which might not be the expected behavior since a single number cannot be considered "consecutive" by itself.
- If the list contains negative numbers or numbers that are not integers, this program might yield unexpected results outside the intended range of natural numbers.

### Test Cases
1. **Empty list**: `func_1([])` → should return `False`, but the code would return `True`.
2. **Single element**: `func_1([5])` → should return `False`, but the code would return `True`.
3. **Regular case**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4])` → returns `True` as expected.
4. **Non-consecutive numbers**: `func_1([1, 2, 4])` → returns `False` as expected.
5. **With duplicates**: `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3])` → returns `False` as expected.
6. **Negative numbers**: `func_1([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1])` → returns `False`, which might be incorrect as `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]` technically has sequences -3 to -2, -2 to -1, -1 to 0, and 0 to 1, but they are not just a singular consecutive series.

### Conclusion
Considering the above points, the program does not correctly handle edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the stated problem requirement is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It sorts the list and checks if all elements in the sorted list are consecutive integers with no duplicates. The function returns `True` if these conditions are met; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that if `lst` is empty, the function will also return `True`, since an empty list has no elements that violate the consecutive and uniqueness conditions. This behavior of treating an empty list as valid may not be clear from the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
