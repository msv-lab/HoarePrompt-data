To determine the correctness of the given program based on the provided problem description, we can analyze the logic of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description Analysis
The function is supposed to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. This typically means that for a list of numbers, after sorting, each number should differ from the next by exactly 1, and no number should be repeated.

### Program Logic Breakdown
- The function first sorts the list.
- Then it checks two conditions:
  1. The difference between each successive pair of elements in the sorted list is exactly 1.
  2. The length of the list should be the same as the length of the set of the list (to ensure there are no duplicates).

### Potential Issues
1. **Empty List**: An empty list is a case that is not explicitly covered. An empty list does not have any numbers, hence can be considered as not containing consecutive numbers.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with a single number (like `[5]`) does not have consecutive numbers, but it also could be argued it does not violate the consecutive requirement as there's nothing to compare against.
3. **Negative Numbers**: The logic does not address negative numbers. For example, a list like `[-2, -1, 0, 1]` contains consecutive 'numbers' but has a gap, so logically would not satisfy a condition checking for "consecutive" numbers.
4. **Diverse Range**: A list like `[1, 2, 3, 5]` will fail as it has a gap between 3 and 5. However, the program does check for this.

### Conclusion
Given these observations, especially noting that an empty list may produce an unintended true value because it does not break the condition (since there are no elements to contradict the definition of "consecutive"), the program fails to correctly handle this edge case by not returning false for an empty input.

Thus, we find a potential case where the program does not work correctly.

Correctness: **False**
