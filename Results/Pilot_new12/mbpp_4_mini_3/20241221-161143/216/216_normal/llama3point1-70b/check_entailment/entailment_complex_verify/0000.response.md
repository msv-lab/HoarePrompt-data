Final: **False**

The program incorrectly handles edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists, returning `True` for these cases when it should return `False`. According to the problem description, a list should contain consecutive numbers, which implies that an empty list cannot be considered as containing consecutive numbers, and a single number also does not meet the criteria of having consecutive numbers. The annotations support this interpretation, clearly stating that the function returns `True` for an empty list, which contradicts the expected behavior as outlined in the original assessment. Therefore, the original assessment accurately identifies that the program does not meet the problem description.
