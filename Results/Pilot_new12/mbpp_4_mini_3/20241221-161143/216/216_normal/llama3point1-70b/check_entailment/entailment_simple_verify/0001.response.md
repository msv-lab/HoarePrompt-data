The original assessment identified that the function `func_1` does not handle certain edge cases correctly, particularly an empty list which could yield a result indirectly supporting that an empty list is considered as containing consecutive numbers. This aligns well with how the function is structured, returning `True` for an empty list as there are no elements to contradict the call.

The annotation confirms that the purpose of the program is to sort the list and then check if each element is consecutive without duplicates. However, the assessment correctly noted the failure to handle edge cases consistently with the problem description's implied requirements—especially the notion of consecutive sequences starting at any point and involving negative numbers.

Given the assumptions stated about input validity—that the function is assumed to always receive a valid input—it does not absolve the function of its implicit shortcomings per the problem description around edge cases.

- Empty List: The function does not consider an empty list to be non-consecutive but rather returns `True`, contradicting the notion of containing consecutive numbers.

Overall, the conclusion of the original assessment being **False** stands, as the function does not meet the broader implied requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
