Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case of an empty list, as it treats it as valid and returns `True`, which does not match the expectation that there should be consecutive numbers present in the list. The output hints confirm this behavior and align with the code's logic. According to the problem description, for the list to contain consecutive numbers, it should have at least one number. The fact that an empty list returns `True` indicates that the implementation does not satisfy the requirement in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
