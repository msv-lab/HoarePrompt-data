Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case of an empty list. While the output hints imply that an empty list will return `True`, this behavior is not typically expected when checking for consecutive numbers. According to standard definitions, a list is expected to contain at least one number to be considered as having consecutive sequences. An empty list does not satisfy this condition meaningfully. Hence, the function should return `False` for an empty list instead of `True`. Additionally, if the list contains only one number (e.g., `[5]`), while technically it has no elements that violate the consecutive condition, the reasoning aligns more closely with needing at least two elements to define "consecutiveness." Therefore, the output of the function is not consistent with intuitive definitions, making it incorrect.
