To determine the correctness of the provided program, letâ€™s first analyze the problem description and the program code.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program uses `set(lst)` which will convert the list to a set, automatically removing all repeated elements. However, the problem specifically requires finding the sum of **non-repeated** elements, meaning elements that occur exactly once in the list, not just unique elements.
  
2. The use of `set` will not help in calculating the sum of non-repeated elements correctly, as it simply discards duplicates. For example:
   - In the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the number `1` is repeated, and thus should not be included in the sum. The non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, whose sum is `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`, not `21` as asserted.

3. Other assertions also suggest incorrect expected results based on the definition of non-repeated elements:
   - For `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`, the non-repeated number is `9` and `2`, summing to `11`, not `71`.
   - For `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]`, the non-repeated number is `12` and `2`, summing to `14`, not `78`.

**Conclusion:**
The program fails to adhere to the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements. Therefore, the provided input cases will yield incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**.
