The original assessment correctly identifies that the implemented function `func_1(lst)` does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem specifically asks for the sum of non-repeated elements, meaning only those elements that appear exactly once in the list should be included in the sum. 

The function, as it is currently written, uses `set(lst)`, which returns all unique elements in the list, regardless of how many times each element appears. Therefore, when the original assessment states that the function does not correctly fulfill the requirements, it is accurate. 

The annotated code also supports the original assessment, as it confirms that the function is returning the sum of unique integers and not addressing the specific request for non-repeated elements.

Thus, my final assessment remains consistent with the original evaluation:

Final: **False**
