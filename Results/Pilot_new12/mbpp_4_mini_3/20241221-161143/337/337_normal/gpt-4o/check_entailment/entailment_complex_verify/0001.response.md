The problem description clearly states that the goal is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This means we only want to include those elements that appear exactly once in the list.

The original function implementation:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```
creates a set from the list which removes duplicates, thus retaining only unique elements. However, this does not align with the requirement to sum only non-repeated elements. 

For instance, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`. The function, however, calculates the sum of all unique elements from the list, which includes `1`, resulting in a total that incorrectly counts it; hence the output will be `21`, contrary to the expected sum of non-repeated elements which is `20`.

The annotations also clarify that the function is summing unique integers, which reinforces the conclusion that the implementation does not match the requirements of the problem description. The statements in the annotations regarding the input being a list of integers and returning the sum of unique integers support the original assessment that the intended behavior is not achieved.

Therefore, upon reviewing the annotated code and the original assessment, the conclusion remains that the function does not meet the problem description's requirements.

Final: **False**
