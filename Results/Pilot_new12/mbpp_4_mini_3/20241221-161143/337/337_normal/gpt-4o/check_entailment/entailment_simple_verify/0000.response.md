The annotated version of the code, along with the analysis provided in the original assessment, does not change the conclusion regarding the correctness of the program. 

The problem description explicitly asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The original assessment correctly points out that the program, which uses a set to find the sum, only identifies unique elements, not non-repeated ones. This crucial distinction leads to incorrect results because repeated elements, such as `1` in the first test case, should not be included in the sum.

The annotations confirm that the program's operation simply sums the unique integers without considering their counts. Hence, while the state annotations indicate the input is a list of integers, they do not account for the necessity of identifying which integers are repeated.

Thus, the original assessment accurately reflects that the program does not meet the problem requirements, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.

Final: **False**
