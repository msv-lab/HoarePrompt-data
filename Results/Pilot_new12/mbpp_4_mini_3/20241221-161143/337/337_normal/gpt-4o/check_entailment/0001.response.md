To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first analyze the problem and then the code implementation.

The problem requires writing a function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This means that we want to sum only those elements that appear exactly once in the list.

Looking at the program:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

The `set(lst)` creates a set from the list which inherently removes duplicates, meaning it keeps only unique elements. Thus, `sum(set(lst))` computes the sum of all unique elements in the list, not just the non-repeated ones.

We can illustrate this problem with an example. Consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`:

- The non-repeated elements in this case are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` (as `1` is repeated).
- The correct sum of non-repeated elements should be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`.

However, the function calculates the sum of unique elements (1 is not included since it is repeated):

- The unique elements would be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, and `sum({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})` equals `21`.

This is incorrect as it does not follow the problem's requirement of summing only non-repeated elements.

Due to this issue, we have identified a failure case where the logic does not satisfy the condition of summing only non-repeated elements. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements mandated by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
