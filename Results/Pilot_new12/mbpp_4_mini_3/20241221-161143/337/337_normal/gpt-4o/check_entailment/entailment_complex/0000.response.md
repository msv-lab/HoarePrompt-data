Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1(lst)` computes the sum of unique integers in the list by converting the list to a set, which removes duplicates, and then summing the values. However, the problem description specifically states that the function should find the sum of non-repeated elements. Non-repeated elements are those that appear exactly once in the list, while the function currently sums all unique elements regardless of their occurrence counts.

For example, in the test case `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])`, the correct sum of non-repeated elements (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) should yield 20, but the function would return 21 since it adds all unique numbers (1 is unique in this context because it only considers distinct values). Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirement of the problem description to only sum elements that are truly non-repeated. 

In conclusion, the implementation does not align with the problem specification regarding the definition of "non-repeated" elements.
