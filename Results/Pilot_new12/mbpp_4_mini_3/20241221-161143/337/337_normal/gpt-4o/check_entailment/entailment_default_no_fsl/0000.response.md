Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` does not provide the correct solution for the problem description of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. Instead, it computes the sum of unique elements, which is not the same. For example, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, and their sum should be `20`, but the function returns `21` by summing the unique elements, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`.

Additionally, consider the output of the second example, `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]`. The non-repeated elements are `1`, `9`, `2`, and `45`, and their sum should be `57`, but the function incorrectly returns `71`.

These inconsistencies demonstrate that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion of correctness being **False**.
