Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the given problem description. The problem description specifies that we need to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, meaning we should only sum elements that appear exactly once in the list. 

However, the provided function `func_1(lst)` calculates the sum of unique integers using `sum(set(lst))`, which sums all unique elements regardless of whether they are repeated or not. For example, in the case `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])`, the correct output should be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`, since only the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are non-repeated. Instead, the function would return 21, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the task of summing only non-repeated elements as stated in the problem description. Hence, the correctness of the program is **False**.
