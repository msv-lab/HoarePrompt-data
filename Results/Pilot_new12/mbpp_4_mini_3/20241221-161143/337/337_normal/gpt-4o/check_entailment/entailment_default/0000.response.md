Explanation: The code appears to be correct as it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` uses the `set` function to remove duplicates from the input list `lst`, ensuring that only unique elements are considered for the sum. The use of `sum` then calculates the total of these unique elements. The output hints agree with the code's functionality and provide additional information about handling an empty list, which correctly returns `0`. All given test cases confirm that the function produces the expected outputs. 

Correctness: **True**.
