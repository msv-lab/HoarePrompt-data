You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first analyze the problem and then the code implementation.

The problem requires writing a function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. This means that we want to sum only those elements that appear exactly once in the list.

Looking at the program:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
```

The `set(lst)` creates a set from the list which inherently removes duplicates, meaning it keeps only unique elements. Thus, `sum(set(lst))` computes the sum of all unique elements in the list, not just the non-repeated ones.

We can illustrate this problem with an example. Consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`:

- The non-repeated elements in this case are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` (as `1` is repeated).
- The correct sum of non-repeated elements should be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`.

However, the function calculates the sum of unique elements (1 is not included since it is repeated):

- The unique elements would be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, and `sum({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})` equals `21`.

This is incorrect as it does not follow the problem's requirement of summing only non-repeated elements.

Due to this issue, we have identified a failure case where the logic does not satisfy the condition of summing only non-repeated elements. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements mandated by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers, and it computes the sum of unique integers present in the list. The function effectively removes any duplicates in the list before summing the values. If the input list is empty, the function will return `0`, as there are no integers to sum.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
