#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
    #The program returns the sum of unique integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers, and it computes the sum of unique integers present in the list. The function effectively removes any duplicates in the list before summing the values. If the input list is empty, the function will return `0`, as there are no integers to sum.
