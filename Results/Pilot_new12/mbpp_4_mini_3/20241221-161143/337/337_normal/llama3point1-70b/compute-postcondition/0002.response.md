Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It computes and returns the sum of all integers in `lst` that appear exactly once. If there are no integers that meet this criterion, the function will return `0`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`. Edge cases such as an empty list will also result in a return value of `0`, since there are no integers to sum. Additionally, any input list containing only duplicated integers will also return `0`.**
