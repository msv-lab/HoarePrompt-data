Explanation: The given function appears to accurately compute the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. The function iterates over each element in the list and checks if its count in the list equals 1. If so, it includes it in the sum. The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles cases like an empty list by returning `0` and also returns `0` when there are no unique elements. Given that every potential case outlined in the problem description is accounted for, the function seems to be implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
