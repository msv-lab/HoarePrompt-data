Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate as it thoroughly evaluates the function `func_1` against the problem description. The function correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements in a list as per the requirements. The annotated version reinforces this by confirming that the function calculates the sum of integers appearing exactly once and handles edge cases appropriately, such as empty lists and lists containing only duplicates.

The test cases provided in the original assessment demonstrate that the function consistently returns the expected output for a variety of scenarios, confirming its correctness. Although there is a noted performance concern due to the time complexity, it does not impact the functionality or correctness of the solution regarding the problem description. Therefore, the assessment holds, and the program is indeed correct in its output for valid input as specified.
