Based on the problem description, the program is designed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The program achieves this by iterating through the list and summing only the elements that appear exactly once.

The original assessment agrees with this by stating that the implementation checks for non-repeated elements by using `lst.count(i) == 1` and that the `sum` function accurately computes the total. It also correctly points out that this implementation handles edge cases effectively, returning `0` for both empty lists and lists with only duplicated integers.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding. It explicitly states that before the function call, `lst` is a list of integers and outlines that the function returns the sum of integers that appear exactly once. It also reinforces that input lists containing only duplicated integers will return `0`, thus aligning with the problem description.

Therefore, combining the insights from the original assessment and the annotations indicates that the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem statement. The logic is sound, and the edge cases have been fairly evaluated.

Final: **True**
