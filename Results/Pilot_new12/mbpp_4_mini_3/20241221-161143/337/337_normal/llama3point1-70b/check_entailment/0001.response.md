To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to examine the function `func_1` and the requirements.

The problem requests a function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. This means that we want to find elements in the list that appear exactly once and then sum those elements.

Here's the provided program again for reference:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

Now, let's evaluate this code against various test cases to see if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Case: `lst = [1, 2, 3]`**
   - Non-repeated elements: 1, 2, 3
   - Expected sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
   - Result from the function: 6 (correct)

2. **Input Case: `lst = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`**
   - Non-repeated elements: 2
   - Expected sum: 2
   - Result from the function: 2 (correct)

3. **Input Case: `lst = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4]`**
   - Non-repeated elements: 2, 3, 4
   - Expected sum: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
   - Result from the function: 9 (correct)

4. **Input Case: `lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]`**
   - Non-repeated elements: 1
   - Expected sum: 1
   - Result from the function: 1 (correct)

5. **Input Case: `lst = []` (empty list)**
   - Non-repeated elements: none
   - Expected sum: 0
   - Result from the function: 0 (correct)

6. **Input Case: `lst = [5, 5, 5]`**
   - Non-repeated elements: none
   - Expected sum: 0
   - Result from the function: 0 (correct)

The program checks each element in the list and uses `lst.count(i)` to determine if that element is non-repeatedâ€”defined as appearing exactly once. This approach works for the provided test cases.

### Potential Performance Issue
However, it is worth noting that `lst.count(i)` inside the generator expression is inefficient, particularly for large lists, because it performs a full scan of `lst` for each unique element, yielding O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case. While this is not a correctness issue, it is a performance issue which might not be in line with practical requirements for larger inputs.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the examples, the function `func_1` produces the correct output for all mentioned cases and meets the requirements of the problem description. Since every example tested returns the expected result, I cannot find any case where the function fails.

Correctness: **True**
