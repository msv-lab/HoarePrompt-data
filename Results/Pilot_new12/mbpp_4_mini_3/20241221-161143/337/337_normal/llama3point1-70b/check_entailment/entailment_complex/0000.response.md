Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst)` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is described as a list of integers.
2. **Logic**: The function uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of elements `i` in `lst` that appear exactly once (`lst.count(i) == 1`).
3. **Return Value**: If there are no non-repeated elements in the list, the sum function will return `0`, which is consistent with the requirement that the function should return `0` if there are no integers that meet the criterion.
4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function also handles edge cases correctly:
   - An empty list will return `0`, since there are no elements to sum.
   - A list containing only duplicated integers will also result in `0`, as there are no unique elements to sum.

Thus, the function operates as expected and adheres to the requirements stated in the problem description, confirming its correctness.
