You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to examine the function `func_1` and the requirements.

The problem requests a function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. This means that we want to find elements in the list that appear exactly once and then sum those elements.

Here's the provided program again for reference:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

Now, let's evaluate this code against various test cases to see if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Case: `lst = [1, 2, 3]`**
   - Non-repeated elements: 1, 2, 3
   - Expected sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
   - Result from the function: 6 (correct)

2. **Input Case: `lst = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`**
   - Non-repeated elements: 2
   - Expected sum: 2
   - Result from the function: 2 (correct)

3. **Input Case: `lst = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4]`**
   - Non-repeated elements: 2, 3, 4
   - Expected sum: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
   - Result from the function: 9 (correct)

4. **Input Case: `lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]`**
   - Non-repeated elements: 1
   - Expected sum: 1
   - Result from the function: 1 (correct)

5. **Input Case: `lst = []` (empty list)**
   - Non-repeated elements: none
   - Expected sum: 0
   - Result from the function: 0 (correct)

6. **Input Case: `lst = [5, 5, 5]`**
   - Non-repeated elements: none
   - Expected sum: 0
   - Result from the function: 0 (correct)

The program checks each element in the list and uses `lst.count(i)` to determine if that element is non-repeatedâ€”defined as appearing exactly once. This approach works for the provided test cases.

### Potential Performance Issue
However, it is worth noting that `lst.count(i)` inside the generator expression is inefficient, particularly for large lists, because it performs a full scan of `lst` for each unique element, yielding O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case. While this is not a correctness issue, it is a performance issue which might not be in line with practical requirements for larger inputs.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the examples, the function `func_1` produces the correct output for all mentioned cases and meets the requirements of the problem description. Since every example tested returns the expected result, I cannot find any case where the function fails.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It computes and returns the sum of all integers in `lst` that appear exactly once. If there are no integers that meet this criterion, the function will return `0`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`. Edge cases such as an empty list will also result in a return value of `0`, since there are no integers to sum. Additionally, any input list containing only duplicated integers will also return `0`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
