Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst` and checks whether the count of each element is exactly one using `lst.count(i) == 1`. 

This means that only non-repeated elements (elements that appear exactly once) are included in the summation. The `sum()` function then adds up these non-repeated elements, producing the desired output, which is the sum of non-repeated elements in the list.

The implementation adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description, and as long as valid input (a list of integers) is provided, it will always return the correct sum of non-repeated elements.
