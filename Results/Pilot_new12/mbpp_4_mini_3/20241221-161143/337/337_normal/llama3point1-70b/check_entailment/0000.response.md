Correctness: **True**.

The program iterates through the given list and uses a generator expression to accumulate the sum of elements that appear only once (non-repeated) in the list. The condition `lst.count(i) == 1` correctly checks for non-repeated elements, and the `sum` function accurately computes the total. 

This implementation will work for all potential cases, such as:
- An empty list, which will correctly return 0.
- A list where all elements are non-repeated.
- A list with a mix of repeated and non-repeated elements.

Since I cannot find any edge cases where this implementation would fail to meet the problem description, the code is correct.
