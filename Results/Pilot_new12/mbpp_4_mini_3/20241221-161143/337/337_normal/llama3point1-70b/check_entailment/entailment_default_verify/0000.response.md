Based on the problem description, the program is intended to calculate the sum of non-repeated (i.e., elements that appear exactly once) integers in a given list. The provided implementation uses a generator expression that correctly identifies elements that do not repeat by checking `lst.count(i) == 1`, and then sums these elements.

The output hints reaffirm this functionality by stating that the function returns `0` if there are no non-repeated integers, and that it also correctly handles an empty list by returning `0`. Additional details confirm that the input list is not modified by the function, which aligns with the problem description.

The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense, as there is no evidence of failure in solving the stated problem under the constraints provided. It successfully handles various cases concerning the presence of repeated or non-repeated elements.

Since the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints do not indicate any discrepancies, the original assessment appears accurate.

Final: **True**
