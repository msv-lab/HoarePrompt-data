Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies and sums non-repeated elements in a given list as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why it is correct.

- The function `func_1` iterates through the list `lst`, checking the count of each element using `lst.count(i)`. It only includes those elements in the sum that appear exactly once.
- The output hints confirm that the function returns the sum of integers appearing exactly once in `lst`, and if none exists, it returns `0`. This matches the requirements specified in the problem description.
- Additionally, cases such as empty lists or lists of duplicated integers are correctly handled by returning `0`, as indicated in the output hints.

Since the program behaves as expected across all described scenarios, we can conclude it is correct in adherence to the problem's requirements.
