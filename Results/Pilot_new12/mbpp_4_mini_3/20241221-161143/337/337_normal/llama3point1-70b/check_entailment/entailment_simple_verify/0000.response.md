Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the required functionality of summing non-repeated elements in the list. The generator expression used (`(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)`) correctly filters the elements that appear exactly once. The annotations confirm that the program's logic is sound and the return value is indeed the sum of those non-repeated integers.

Additionally, the program has been evaluated against various potential scenarios (such as empty lists or lists containing only non-repeated elements), and it performs correctly in all cases. Since the input is guaranteed to be a valid list of integers (based on the annotations), the program fulfills the problem description without error. This solidifies the correctness of the implementation.
