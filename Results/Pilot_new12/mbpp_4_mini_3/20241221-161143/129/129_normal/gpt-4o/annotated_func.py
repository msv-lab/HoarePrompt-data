#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode code point of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `char`, which is expected to be a one-character string. It returns the Unicode code point corresponding to the character provided. If the input is not a single character (e.g., an empty string or a string with more than one character), the behavior of the function may be undefined, as the function does not include validation to ensure `char` meets the expected criteria. Hence, while the intention is to convert a single character to its Unicode code point, the function does not handle such edge cases properly, leading to potential errors in those scenarios.
