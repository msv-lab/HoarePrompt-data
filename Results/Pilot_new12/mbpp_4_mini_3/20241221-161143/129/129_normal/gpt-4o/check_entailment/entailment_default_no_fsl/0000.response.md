Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` is intended to return the ASCII (or Unicode) value of a single character. However, it does not include validation to ensure that the input `char` is indeed a single character string. According to the output hints, if the input is not a one-character string (e.g., an empty string, a string with multiple characters, or even a non-string type), the behavior of the function may be undefined. 

An example of a case where the program fails is when the input is an empty string `func_1('')`, which could lead to unexpected behavior since there is no character to evaluate. This lack of error handling for cases outside the expected input leads to the conclusion that the program does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case. Hence, it is considered incorrect.
