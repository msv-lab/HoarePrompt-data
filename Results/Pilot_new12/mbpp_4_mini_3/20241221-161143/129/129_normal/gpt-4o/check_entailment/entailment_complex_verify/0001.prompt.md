You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly calculates and returns the ASCII value of a given character using the `ord()` function. The provided assertions confirm that it returns the expected values for uppercase characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. 

To verify correctness for edge cases, we consider:
1. The function should handle all valid single-character inputs, including lowercase letters, digits, punctuation marks, and special characters.
2. The function should raise an appropriate error for invalid inputs, such as empty strings or multi-character strings.

However, testing with valid single characters shows the function operates correctly. For example:
- `func_1('a')` returns 97
- `func_1('1')` returns 49
- `func_1('!')` returns 33

The function does not account for empty strings or multi-character strings, but given the problem description's focus on a single character, this is not an oversight. Hence, it meets the requirements. Since no invalid cases that violate the functionality specified in the problem description can be found, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode code point of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `char`, which is expected to be a one-character string. It returns the Unicode code point corresponding to the character provided. If the input is not a single character (e.g., an empty string or a string with more than one character), the behavior of the function may be undefined, as the function does not include validation to ensure `char` meets the expected criteria. Hence, while the intention is to convert a single character to its Unicode code point, the function does not handle such edge cases properly, leading to potential errors in those scenarios.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
