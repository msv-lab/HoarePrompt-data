Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `ord` function to return the ASCII (Unicode) value of a character. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not include validation for the input `char`, meaning it can accept a string that's not a single character (like an empty string or a string with more than one character), which leads to undefined behavior. For example, if the input is an empty string `''`, the function will return an error since `ord` expects a string of length 1. This fails to meet the correctness requirements outlined in the problem description.
