Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the intended behavior of returning the ASCII value of a single character using the built-in `ord` function. The annotations confirm that the function is designed to accept a valid single-character string and that the assertions validate its correctness for specific characters ('A', 'R', 'S'), which meet the problem description. While the function does not handle edge cases where the input might not be a single character, the problem statement specifies that we assume valid input will always be provided. Given these conditions, the function correctly fulfills its purpose as described in the problem statement.
