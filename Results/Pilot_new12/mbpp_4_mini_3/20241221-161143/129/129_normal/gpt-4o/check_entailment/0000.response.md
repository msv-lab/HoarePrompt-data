Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly utilizes the `ord` function to return the ASCII value of the input character. The assertions provided confirm that the function works for the specific characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Additionally, there are no apparent edge cases present that could cause the function to misbehave, as the `ord` function is designed to work correctly with any string of a single character.

For any single character input, whether it be an uppercase letter (e.g., 'A', 'Z'), a lowercase letter (e.g., 'a', 'z'), a digit (e.g., '0', '9'), or any other character (e.g., '@', '#', etc.), the function will successfully return the corresponding ASCII value, making it robust for a wide range of inputs.
