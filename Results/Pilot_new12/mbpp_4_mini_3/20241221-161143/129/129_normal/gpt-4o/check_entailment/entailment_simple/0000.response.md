Correctness: **True**

The program accurately fulfills the problem description, which specifies that a function should be created to find the ASCII value of a character. The function `func_1(char)` employs the built-in `ord()` function, which returns the Unicode code point for the given character. Since ASCII values are equivalent to the Unicode code points for characters in the ASCII range (0-127), the implementation correctly derives the ASCII value of any single character input.

The program includes assertions that test the function with valid input characters ('A', 'R', and 'S') and expects the correct ASCII values (65, 82, and 83, respectively). These assertions confirm that the function behaves as intended for the provided test cases.

In conclusion, since the function correctly computes the ASCII value of a single character string as specified in the problem description, the program is correct, and the response can confidently state that the correctness is **True**.
