Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly calculates and returns the ASCII value of a given character using the `ord()` function. The provided assertions confirm that it returns the expected values for uppercase characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. 

To verify correctness for edge cases, we consider:
1. The function should handle all valid single-character inputs, including lowercase letters, digits, punctuation marks, and special characters.
2. The function should raise an appropriate error for invalid inputs, such as empty strings or multi-character strings.

However, testing with valid single characters shows the function operates correctly. For example:
- `func_1('a')` returns 97
- `func_1('1')` returns 49
- `func_1('!')` returns 33

The function does not account for empty strings or multi-character strings, but given the problem description's focus on a single character, this is not an oversight. Hence, it meets the requirements. Since no invalid cases that violate the functionality specified in the problem description can be found, the program is considered correct.
