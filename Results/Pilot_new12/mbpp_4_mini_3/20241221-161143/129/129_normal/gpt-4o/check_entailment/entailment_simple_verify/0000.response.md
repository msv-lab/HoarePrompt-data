Final: **True** 

The program correctly implements the requirement to find the ASCII value of a character using the `ord` function. The original assessment accurately reflects the functionality of the program and is supported by the annotations provided. The assertions verify that the program works for the specified characters, confirming its correctness in producing the expected ASCII values. 

Additionally, the assumption that valid input will always be provided is valid in the context of the problem description. Therefore, based on the provided information and annotations, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
