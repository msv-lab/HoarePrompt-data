Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` correctly calculates and returns the ASCII value of a given single character using the `ord()` function. The program's assertions confirm the expected values for the provided test cases. The annotations reinforce this correctness, indicating that prior to the function invocation, the input is assured to be a single character string, and the function appropriately returns its ASCII value.

The consideration of edge cases, including the function's handling of valid inputs, further supports the correctness of the program given the problem description focuses exclusively on a single character. Since the input is assumed to be valid as specified, and the function behaves as expected for all valid cases tested, the original assessment stands correct. Thus, the final assessment is **True**.
