Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements set out in the problem description. It correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character string as input and returns the ASCII value (Unicode code point) of that character using the `ord()` function. 

The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for valid single character inputs, returning the correct ASCII values for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. 

Additionally, since we are assuming valid input as per the problem statement, the absence of input validation does not affect the correctness of the program under the assumption that the input will always be valid. Therefore, for any valid single-character string input, the function will reliably return the correct ASCII value, aligning with the problem description.
