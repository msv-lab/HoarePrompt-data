#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ASCII value of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value as an integer. The function doesn't explicitly handle cases where the input is not a single character (e.g., empty strings or strings longer than one character), which could result in unexpected behavior. The overall effect of executing this function is that it provides the ASCII value corresponding to the input character, but it assumes correct input without validation.
