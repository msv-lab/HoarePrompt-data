Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that accepts a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. 

1. The function's parameter `char` is explicitly stated to be a single character string, which aligns with the requirement of finding the ASCII value of a character.
2. The `ord(char)` function call retrieves the ASCII value of the provided character, fulfilling the return requirement of the problem description.

Since the program adheres to the specified requirements without any assumptions about invalid inputs, it is correct. Thus, it consistently produces the expected outcomeâ€”returning the ASCII value of the input character.
