Correctness: **True**. 

The function consistently returns the ASCII value of the provided character. It utilizes the built-in `ord()` function, which accurately translates any valid single-character string input into its corresponding ASCII value. Given that the problem description specifies the need to find the ASCII value of a character, and the implementation adheres to this requirement by correctly handling valid inputs (including letters, numbers, and symbols), the program is considered correct. Additionally, it is defined to take a single character as specified in the problem description, which further supports its correctness. 

All the expected edge cases have been accounted for: any valid character provided will yield its corresponding ASCII value correctly. For example, `func_1('A')` returns 65 and `func_1('a')` returns 97, demonstrating the function works as described. No cases where it fails to do what is expected can be identified.
