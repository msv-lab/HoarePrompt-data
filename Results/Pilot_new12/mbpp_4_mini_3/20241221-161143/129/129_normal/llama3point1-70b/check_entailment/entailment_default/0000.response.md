Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. However, according to the problem description, the function is expected to work specifically with a single character. The output hints indicate a flaw in the function, as it does not handle cases where the input is an empty string or a string longer than one character. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as raising an error or returning an incorrect ASCII value.

For example, if the input is an empty string `""`, `ord("")` would result in an error. Similarly, for inputs like `"ab"` or `"12"`, the function does not ensure that the input is limited to just one character, affecting its validity according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
