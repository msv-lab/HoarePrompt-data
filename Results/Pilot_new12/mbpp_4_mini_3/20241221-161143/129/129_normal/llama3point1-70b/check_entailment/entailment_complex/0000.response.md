Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that accepts a single character string as an argument and returns the ASCII value of that character using the built-in `ord()` function. The implementation aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the function must find and return the ASCII value of a character.

Hereâ€™s why the program is considered correct:

1. **Input Specification**: The function is designed to take a single character, which is expected according to the problem description. While it does not explicitly handle input validation, we assume the input will always be valid as per the given instructions.

2. **Output Specification**: The function correctly returns the ASCII value as an integer using `ord()`, which is precisely what the problem requires.

3. **Assumed Input Validity**: The problem statement indicates that it is acceptable to assume valid input. Since the only input type expected is a single character (and we assume it will not be an empty string or a multi-character string), the current implementation fulfills the function's purpose.

In summary, the program meets the requirements set forth by the problem description without any logical flaws, and it operates under the assumptions specified, which validates its correctness.
