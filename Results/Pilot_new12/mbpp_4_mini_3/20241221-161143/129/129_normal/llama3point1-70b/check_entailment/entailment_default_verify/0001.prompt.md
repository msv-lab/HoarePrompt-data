You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
def func_1(char: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly adhere to the problem description's parameter specification. The function `func_1` is expected to accept a single character as input. However, it does not enforce this restriction, meaning that it can also accept strings longer than one character or even empty strings. In such cases, the behavior of `ord()` may not align with the expected output described in the problem statement, which implicitly assumes the input will strictly be a single character.

For example:
- If we call `func_1("a")`, it correctly returns `97`, which is the ASCII value of `'a'`.
- If we call `func_1("ab")`, the program would still run but would raise a TypeError when `ord()` is called, as multiple characters are not supported.
- If we call `func_1("")`, it would lead to an `IndexError` since there is no character to extract.

Thus, a single input case like an empty string or a multi-character string demonstrates that the function does not operate correctly under the conditions outlined in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value as an integer. The function doesn't explicitly handle cases where the input is not a single character (e.g., empty strings or strings longer than one character), which could result in unexpected behavior. The overall effect of executing this function is that it provides the ASCII value corresponding to the input character, but it assumes correct input without validation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
