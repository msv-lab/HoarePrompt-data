Final: **True**

The original assessment's conclusion of correctness is supported by the problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` is designed to return the ASCII value of a given single character string, which aligns perfectly with the stated problem description. 

The annotations confirm that before the function call, the input `char` is indeed a single character string, and the return statement `return ord(char)` correctly utilizes the `ord()` function to obtain the ASCII value. The provided reasoning also emphasizes that the program correctly handles valid single-character inputs, which includes letters, numbers, and symbols.

Overall, since the program meets the requirements posited in the problem description and is supported by the annotations at every relevant state, the original assessment of correctness is accurate. Thus, the final determination of the program's correctness is **True**.
