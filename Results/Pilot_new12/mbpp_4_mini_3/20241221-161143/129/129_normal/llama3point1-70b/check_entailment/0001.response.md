Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly adhere to the problem description's parameter specification. The function `func_1` is expected to accept a single character as input. However, it does not enforce this restriction, meaning that it can also accept strings longer than one character or even empty strings. In such cases, the behavior of `ord()` may not align with the expected output described in the problem statement, which implicitly assumes the input will strictly be a single character.

For example:
- If we call `func_1("a")`, it correctly returns `97`, which is the ASCII value of `'a'`.
- If we call `func_1("ab")`, the program would still run but would raise a TypeError when `ord()` is called, as multiple characters are not supported.
- If we call `func_1("")`, it would lead to an `IndexError` since there is no character to extract.

Thus, a single input case like an empty string or a multi-character string demonstrates that the function does not operate correctly under the conditions outlined in the problem description.
