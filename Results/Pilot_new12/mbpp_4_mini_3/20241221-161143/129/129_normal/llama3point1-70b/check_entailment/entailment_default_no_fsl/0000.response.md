Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string. For example, if the input is an empty string or a string longer than one character, the function will still attempt to calculate the ASCII value using the `ord()` function, which leads to incorrect behavior. According to the output hints, the function assumes the input will always be valid, but since the prompt requires it to work for all potential cases—including invalid inputs—the lack of input validation makes the program incorrect. For instance, calling `func_1("")` or `func_1("abc")` would not yield the expected behavior, which violates the requirements outlined in the problem description.
