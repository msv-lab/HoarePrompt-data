#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter 'numbers', which is a list of integers. It returns a new list containing only the even integers from the input list. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function does not handle non-integer elements in 'numbers' and will raise a TypeError if such elements are present.
