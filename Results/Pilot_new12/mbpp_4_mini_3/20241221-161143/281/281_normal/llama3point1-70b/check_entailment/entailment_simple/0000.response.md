Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function that finds even numbers from a given list of integers. The list comprehension within the function iterates through each integer in the input list (`numbers`) and checks if the integer is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. If the condition is met, the integer is included in the returned list.

This meets the requirements of the problem description, which asks the function to identify and return all even numbers from the provided list. Since the function only processes valid input (a list of integers) as specified and returns the correct result according to the conditions established, it adheres to the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct.
