Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over all the elements in the provided list and checks if each number is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This is the standard approach to filter even numbers, and it will work for all integer inputs, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. 

The code also handles edge cases such as:
- An empty list, which would correctly return an empty list.
- A list that contains only odd numbers, which would return an empty list.
- A list that includes both even and odd numbers, which would return a list of only the even numbers from the input.

Since there are no examples where the program fails to find even numbers from a list of integers, the program is considered correct.
