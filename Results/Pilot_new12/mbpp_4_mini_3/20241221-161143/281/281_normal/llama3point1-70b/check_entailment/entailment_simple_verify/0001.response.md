Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality to find even numbers in a list of integers, as described in the problem. The annotations confirm that before entering the function, `numbers` is indeed a list of integers, and the function returns only the even integers from that list.

The program handles various edge cases appropriately, including:
- An empty list returns an empty list.
- A list with only odd numbers returns an empty list.
- A list with both even and odd numbers returns a list of even numbers.

The reasoning in the original assessment about the standard approach to filter even numbers using a list comprehension and the correctness of the calculation of evenness (via `% 2 == 0`) is valid and well-supported by the annotations provided.

Therefore, there is sufficient evidence from the annotations and the original assessment to conclude that the program is indeed correct.
