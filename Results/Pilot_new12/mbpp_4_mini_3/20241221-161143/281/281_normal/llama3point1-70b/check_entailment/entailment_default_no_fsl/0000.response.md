Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle non-integer elements in the list. According to the output hints, if the input list contains non-integer elements, the function will raise a TypeError. This means the function does not work correctly for every potential case, specifically when non-integer elements are present in the input list. Therefore, the function fails the correctness criteria established in the problem description.
