Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from that list. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function parameter `numbers` is described as a list of integers. The problem description does not specify handling for non-integer types or empty lists, implying that we can assume the input will always be valid integers, as per the assumptions stated.

2. **List Comprehension**: The use of list comprehension (`[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]`) efficiently filters through the list to select only the even numbers, satisfying the requirement to return even numbers.

3. **Return Value**: If the input list contains even integers, it will return a new list with those integers. If there are no even integers or if the list is empty, the function will correctly return an empty list, which aligns with typical expected behavior for such functions.

4. **Correctness Across Potential Cases**: The function will always produce the correct output for the specified inputs (i.e., a list of integers) as described. Non-integer handling is not required by the problem, and since we assume valid input, we don't focus on those cases.

Overall, the program meets the problem's specifications by returning a list of even integers from a valid list of integers. Therefore, the conclusion is that the implementation is correct.
