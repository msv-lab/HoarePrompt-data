Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers by using a list comprehension that checks each number to see if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). It will include only those numbers in the resulting list. This approach covers all potential cases, including negative even numbers, zero, and handles empty lists correctly by returning an empty list. Given the problem description, the implementation meets the requirements accurately.
