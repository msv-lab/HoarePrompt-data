#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of all even integers from the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all the even integers from the input list. It effectively filters out any odd integers. The final output will be an empty list if there are no even integers in the input list. Additionally, if the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list as well.
