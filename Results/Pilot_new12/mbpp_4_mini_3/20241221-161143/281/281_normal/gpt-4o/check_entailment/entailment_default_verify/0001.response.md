Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a given list of integers. It effectively filters out odd integers using the condition `num % 2 == 0`, and the assertions provided confirm that the function produces the expected results for various input cases.

The output hints align well with both the problem description and the functionality of the program, stating that the function will return a new list containing only even integers, and it will return an empty list when there are no even integers or when the input list is empty. These expectations have been validated through the assertions and the outputs they provide.

Since there are no discrepancies between the problem description, the program implementation, and the output hints, the program's correctness stands confirmed.
