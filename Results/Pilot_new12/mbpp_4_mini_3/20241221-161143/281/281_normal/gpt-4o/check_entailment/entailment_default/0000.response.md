Explanation: The program correctly implements a function that provides a list of even numbers from the input list of integers. The list comprehension `return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` efficiently filters out odd integers and retains even ones. The output hints confirm that the function does exactly as described, including returning an empty list if there are no even integers or if the input list is empty. Since the output of the provided assertions matches the expected results, the function is valid for all potential cases outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
