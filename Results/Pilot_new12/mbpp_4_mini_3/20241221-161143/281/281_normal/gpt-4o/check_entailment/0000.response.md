Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly finds even numbers from a list of numbers. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to filter out and return only the numbers that are even (i.e., those for which the modulus operation `num % 2` results in zero). The assertion tests provided also indicate that the function behaves as expected for the test cases given.

- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it returns `[2, 4]`, which is correct.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, it returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, also correct.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, it returns `[8, 12]`, which is again correct.

Given that these test cases cover a reasonable range of possible inputs and the logic implemented in `func_1` adheres to the problem's requirement of identifying even numbers, no potential cases were found where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Thus, the code is correct and fulfills the problem description.
