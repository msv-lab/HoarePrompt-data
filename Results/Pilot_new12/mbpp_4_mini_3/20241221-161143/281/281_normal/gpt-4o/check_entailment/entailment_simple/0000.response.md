Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(numbers)` is designed to find and return even numbers from a list of integers. Hereâ€™s an explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single input argument, `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers. According to the problem description, we assume that the input is always valid, so we do not need to handle invalid inputs.

2. **Function Logic**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the list. For each `num`, it checks if `num % 2 == 0`, which determines if the number is even:
   - If this condition is true, the number is included in the resulting list.
   - If false, it is excluded.

3. **Output**: The function returns a list containing only the even numbers from the original list. This directly satisfies the requirement of the problem, which is to "find even numbers from a list of numbers."

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works as intended for various test cases:
   - It returns `[2, 4]` when given `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - It returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]` when given `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`.
   - It returns `[8, 12]` when given `[8, 12, 15, 19]`.

All assertions pass, confirming that the implementation consistently fulfills the requirement stated in the problem description. Since the program correctly finds even numbers from a list and the inputs are assumed valid, the correctness of the program is duly affirmed as **True**.
