Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function that returns all even numbers from a given list of integers. The list comprehension used in `func_1` effectively filters the input list by checking if each number is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder). 

The output hints confirm that the function will return a new list with even integers, which matches the expected behavior outlined in the problem description. It will return an empty list if there are no even integers in the input list or if the input list itself is empty.

All provided assertions in the program example pass, confirming that the function performs correctly for the given inputs. Since there are no identified edge cases or discrepancies in the program's behavior based on the hints and descriptions, it can be assumed that the function meets the requirements for every potential case as described.
