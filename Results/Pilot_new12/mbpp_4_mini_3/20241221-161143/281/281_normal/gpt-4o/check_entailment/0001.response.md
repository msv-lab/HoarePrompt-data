Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from the provided list of integers. It iterates through each number in the input list, checking if the number is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0` and returns a list of those numbers.

The assertions provided as test cases have the following expected outputs, which are consistent with the function's logic:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the even numbers are `[2, 4]`, which is as expected.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, the even numbers are `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, which matches the output.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, the even numbers are `[8, 12]`, consistent with the output.

The function handles various input cases correctly, including lists of even numbers, mixed numbers, and zero (which is even). Since there are no edge cases or other inputs where the function does not perform as expected, the program can be deemed correct.
