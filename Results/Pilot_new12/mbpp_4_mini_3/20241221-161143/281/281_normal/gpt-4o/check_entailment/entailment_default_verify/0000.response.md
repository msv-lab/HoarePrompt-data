Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description by correctly identifying and returning even numbers from a list. The function `func_1` utilizes a list comprehension effectively to filter even integers, and the provided assertions validate its correctness against sample inputs. 

Additionally, the output hints reinforce that the function handles all specified cases correctly: it returns an empty list if no even integers are present or if the input list is empty. Hence, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and meets the criteria for correctness.
