Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to find even numbers from a list of integers. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(numbers)` correctly uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `numbers` and checks if the number is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). It includes all even numbers in the returned list.

2. **Output**: The function returns a new list that contains only the even integers from the original input list. According to the problem description, this is exactly what is requiredâ€”finding and returning even numbers.

3. **Handling Different Scenarios**: The function handles various scenarios properly:
   - If the input list contains only odd numbers, the result will be an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
   - If the input list itself is empty, the function will also return an empty list, aligning with the stated requirement.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests that confirm the function's output for specific cases. They demonstrate that the function works correctly for multiple input scenarios.

In summary, the program adheres to the problem's requirements to find and return even numbers from a list of integers, hence it is deemed correct.
