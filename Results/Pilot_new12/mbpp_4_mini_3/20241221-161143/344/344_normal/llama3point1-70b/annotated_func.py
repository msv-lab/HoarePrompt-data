#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of sorted integers, and value is an integer that needs to be inserted into sorted_list while maintaining the order.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers, `value` is an integer to be inserted, the index `i` is the length of `sorted_list`, indicating `value` is to be appended to the end of the list.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of 'sorted_list', which is the number of sorted integers it contains before the insertion of 'value'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of sorted integers, and `value`, an integer that needs to be inserted into `sorted_list` while preserving the order. The function iterates through `sorted_list` to find the first index `i` where the element is greater than or equal to `value`. It returns this index, indicating where `value` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If all elements in `sorted_list` are less than `value`, the function returns the length of `sorted_list`, indicating that `value` should be appended at the end. Potential edge cases include the scenarios with an empty `sorted_list` and when `value` is less than all elements, equal to the smallest element, or greater than all elements. The function handles these cases correctly by returning the appropriate indices or length as needed.
