The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of sorted integers, and `value`, which is an integer that needs to be inserted into `sorted_list` while maintaining the order. After executing the function body, the following cases occur:

- Case_1: If the first element of `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns index 0, indicating that `value` can be inserted at the start of the list.
  
- Case_2: If the insertion point for `value` is found at index 1, the function returns that index.

- Case_3: If the function determines that the insertion point for `value` is at index 2, it returns that index.

- Case_4: If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, the function returns the length of `sorted_list`, indicating the number of sorted integers present before the insertion.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sorted integers and an integer `value`, and return the index at which `value` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order, with special handling for different conditions based on the relationship between `value` and the elements in `sorted_list`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `sorted_list`, which is a list of sorted integers, and an integer `value`, and returns the index at which `value` can be inserted to maintain order. The function handles cases where `value` fits at the beginning, between existing elements, or at the end of the list.**
