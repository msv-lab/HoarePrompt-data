Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers and `value` is an integer to be inserted. Since the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`, if `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns the index `i`, which is currently 1, indicating the position where `value` can be inserted to maintain order.***
