Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of sorted integers, and `value`, an integer that needs to be inserted into `sorted_list` while preserving the order. The function iterates through `sorted_list` to find the first index `i` where the element is greater than or equal to `value`. It returns this index, indicating where `value` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If all elements in `sorted_list` are less than `value`, the function returns the length of `sorted_list`, indicating that `value` should be appended at the end. Potential edge cases include the scenarios with an empty `sorted_list` and when `value` is less than all elements, equal to the smallest element, or greater than all elements. The function handles these cases correctly by returning the appropriate indices or length as needed.**
