To analyze the code provided, observe that the loop iterates over `sorted_list`, checking each value against `value`. The loop continues until either a value in `sorted_list` is found that is greater than or equal to `value`, or all elements in `sorted_list` have been checked. 

If the loop executes a number of times equal to the length of `sorted_list`, then it implies that all elements of `sorted_list` have been less than `value`. In this case, since no return has occurred, it indicates `value` should be appended to the end of `sorted_list`.

Thus, letâ€™s summarize the output states after all iterations of the loop have finished based on this logic.

Output State: **`sorted_list` is a list of sorted integers, `value` is an integer to be inserted, the index `i` is the length of `sorted_list`, indicating `value` is to be appended to the end of the list.**
