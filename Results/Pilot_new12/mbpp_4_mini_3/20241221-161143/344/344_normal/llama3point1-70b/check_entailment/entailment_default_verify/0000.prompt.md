You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the description, we need to analyze the function.

The problem description states: "Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order."

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function aims to return the index at which `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `sorted_list`.
2. **Looping through the Sorted List**: The program correctly iterates through each element in `sorted_list` and checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `value`. If it finds such an element, it returns the index of that element.
3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - If `sorted_list` is empty, the function correctly returns `0`, which is the correct insertion point for any value.
   - If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, the loop will complete without finding an index to return, and the function will return `len(sorted_list)`, which is the correct insertion point.
   - If `value` is less than or equal to the first element of `sorted_list`, the function will return `0`, which is also correct.
4. **Potential Case**: One potential issue arises when the `sorted_list` contains duplicate values. Consider a case where `sorted_list = [2, 2, 2]` and `value = 2`. The expected insertion point is `0`, but the function returns `0` correctly. However, if `value` were `1`, the expected insertion point would be `0` because the value should be inserted before all occurrences of `2`, which is what the function would return.
5. **Additional Checks**: The function does not have any safeguards against non-sorted lists or incompatible data types for comparison, but the problem description does not specify whether the input will always be a sorted list.

### Conclusion:
The function behaves correctly for every situation it is expected to handle according to the problem description. There are no evident cases where it fails to deliver the right insertion point for a valid input of `sorted_list`.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of sorted integers, and `value`, an integer that needs to be inserted into `sorted_list` while preserving the order. The function iterates through `sorted_list` to find the first index `i` where the element is greater than or equal to `value`. It returns this index, indicating where `value` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If all elements in `sorted_list` are less than `value`, the function returns the length of `sorted_list`, indicating that `value` should be appended at the end. Potential edge cases include the scenarios with an empty `sorted_list` and when `value` is less than all elements, equal to the smallest element, or greater than all elements. The function handles these cases correctly by returning the appropriate indices or length as needed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
