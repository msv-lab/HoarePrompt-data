Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the described functionality of locating the appropriate insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Here's why it fulfills the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Iteration through the sorted list**: The program uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the `sorted_list`. It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`.

2. **Condition check**: When the condition `sorted_list[i] >= value` is met, it returns the index `i`. This index represents the correct insertion point for `value` such that the order of the sorted list is maintained. If `value` is found to be less than or equal to an element, it should be inserted before that element.

3. **Handling the case where `value` is greater than all elements**: If the loop completes without finding a suitable insertion index (which means `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`), the function returns `len(sorted_list)`. This correctly indicates that `value` should be appended to the end of the list.

4. **Correct output in all cases**: The function effectively covers all scenarios, whether `value` is lesser than, equal to, or greater than the elements in the sorted list.

Thus, the program correctly provides the right insertion point for a value in sorted order, as required by the problem description.
