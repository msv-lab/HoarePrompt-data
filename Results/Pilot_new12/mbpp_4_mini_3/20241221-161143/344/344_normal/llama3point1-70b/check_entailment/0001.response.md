To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to assess whether it correctly identifies the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list.

The function `func_1` iterates through each element in the `sorted_list` and checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`. If it finds such an element, it returns the index of that element, which indicates where the `value` should be inserted to maintain sorted order. If no element is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns the length of the list, which signifies that the `value` should be placed at the end.

Let's consider some test cases to validate the function:

1. **Test Case 1: Empty List**
   - Input: `([], 5)`
   - Output: `0` (expected)
   
2. **Test Case 2: Single Element List (Value Less Than Element)**
   - Input: `([10], 5)`
   - Output: `0` (expected)
   
3. **Test Case 3: Single Element List (Value Greater Than Element)**
   - Input: `([10], 15)`
   - Output: `1` (expected)
   
4. **Test Case 4: Value Matches Element in List**
   - Input: `([10, 20, 30], 20)`
   - Output: `1` (expected)
   
5. **Test Case 5: All Elements Greater than Value**
   - Input: `([10, 20, 30], 5)`
   - Output: `0` (expected)
   
6. **Test Case 6: Value Greater than All Elements**
   - Input: `([10, 20, 30], 35)`
   - Output: `3` (expected)
   
7. **Test Case 7: Insert in Between Elements**
   - Input: `([10, 20, 30], 25)`
   - Output: `2` (expected)

Now, let's analyze if there are any edge cases or potential issues that the code does not handle properly. 

One potential edge case is if the input `sorted_list` contains duplicate values. For example:

1. **Duplicate Values**
   - Input: `([10, 10, 20], 10)`
   - Expected Output: The function can return either of the indices `0` or `1` (both are valid). However, if the behavior is inconsistent, it might not be correct.

The current implementation will return index `0`, because it finds the first `10` and stops searching, which is acceptable based on the problem description. 

After analyzing various edge cases, including lists with duplicates and variations in size, I find no inconsistencies or missed cases.

Given all the checks, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly identifies the right insertion point for any specified value in all scenarios presented.
