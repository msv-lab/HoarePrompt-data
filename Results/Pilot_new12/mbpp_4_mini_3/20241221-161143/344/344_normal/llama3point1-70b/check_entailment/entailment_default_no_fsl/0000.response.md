Correctness: **True**

The provided function correctly implements the logic required to find the appropriate insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list of integers. It iterates through the `sorted_list` and checks for the first index `i` where the element is greater than or equal to the `value`. This accurately captures the requirements of maintaining sorted order.

The output hints explain that the function handles various edge cases correctly, including:
1. An empty `sorted_list`, where the function returns `0`.
2. When `value` is less than the smallest element, equal to the smallest element, or greater than all elements, returning the appropriate indices or the length of the list.

Since all potential edge cases are managed appropriately, the function fulfills the problem's requirements. Thus, we conclude it is correct in all scenarios as specified.
