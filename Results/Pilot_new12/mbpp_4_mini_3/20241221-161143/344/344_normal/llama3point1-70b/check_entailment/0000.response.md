To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the description, we need to analyze the function.

The problem description states: "Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order."

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function aims to return the index at which `value` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `sorted_list`.
2. **Looping through the Sorted List**: The program correctly iterates through each element in `sorted_list` and checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `value`. If it finds such an element, it returns the index of that element.
3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - If `sorted_list` is empty, the function correctly returns `0`, which is the correct insertion point for any value.
   - If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, the loop will complete without finding an index to return, and the function will return `len(sorted_list)`, which is the correct insertion point.
   - If `value` is less than or equal to the first element of `sorted_list`, the function will return `0`, which is also correct.
4. **Potential Case**: One potential issue arises when the `sorted_list` contains duplicate values. Consider a case where `sorted_list = [2, 2, 2]` and `value = 2`. The expected insertion point is `0`, but the function returns `0` correctly. However, if `value` were `1`, the expected insertion point would be `0` because the value should be inserted before all occurrences of `2`, which is what the function would return.
5. **Additional Checks**: The function does not have any safeguards against non-sorted lists or incompatible data types for comparison, but the problem description does not specify whether the input will always be a sorted list.

### Conclusion:
The function behaves correctly for every situation it is expected to handle according to the problem description. There are no evident cases where it fails to deliver the right insertion point for a valid input of `sorted_list`.

Correctness: **True**.
