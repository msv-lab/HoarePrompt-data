Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program successfully implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The provided annotations further validate this by clearly outlining the expected behavior of the function. 

The annotations confirm that the function:

- Accepts a sorted list and a value.
- Utilizes `bisect.bisect_right` to find the appropriate insertion index without modifying the original list.
- Handles cases where the value is less than, between, or greater than elements in the list accurately.

The assertions provided in the code cover significant cases, and the function behaves as expected in each scenario. Therefore, based on the analysis of the annotations and the original assessment, the program is deemed correct.
