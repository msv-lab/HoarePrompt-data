Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program correctly implements a function to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list using the `bisect.bisect_right` function. 

The provided annotations effectively describe the states of the program, specifically confirming that the `sorted_list` is sorted and the `value` to be inserted is appropriately handled. The assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various test cases, where it correctly identifies the index for insertion to maintain sorted order.

All test cases examined align with the expected output based on the function's intended behavior. Therefore, the program meets the problem description requirements, and the annotated version corroborates the original assessment.
