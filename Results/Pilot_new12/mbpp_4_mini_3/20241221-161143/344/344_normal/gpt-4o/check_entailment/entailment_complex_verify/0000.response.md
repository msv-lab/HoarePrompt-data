Final: **True** 

The program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness. The function `func_1` correctly utilizes `bisect.bisect_right` to find the right insertion point of a specified value in a sorted list, as confirmed by the provided test cases. The annotations clearly describe how the function operates, indicating that it handles edge cases effectively and maintains the sorted order of the list. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains validated.
