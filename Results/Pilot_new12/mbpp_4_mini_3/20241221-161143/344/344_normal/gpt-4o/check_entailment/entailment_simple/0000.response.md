Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` library to determine the correct insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a sorted list and a value as input and returns the index where the value can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. This aligns perfectly with the problem requirement to locate the right insertion point.

2. **Correctness of Return Values**: The asserts provided test specific scenarios:
   - For the input `([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the expected output is `4`, which is correct as `6` should be inserted at the end of the list.
   - For the input `([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the expected output is `2`, which correctly indicates the position before `4` where `3` can be inserted.
   - For the input `([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the expected output is again `4`, confirming that `7` should be at the end.

3. **Use of `bisect_right`**: The usage of the `bisect_right` method means that if the value to insert already exists in the list, the method will return an index that is right after the last occurrence of that value. This behavior is consistent with the notion of "insertion points" as it gives the next position for insertion without disrupting the order.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the functionality outlined in the problem description, thus the correctness evaluation is **True**.
