Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

Here's why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right` to determine the correct index for insertion. This is exactly what the problem description asks for â€” finding the appropriate index to insert a value while maintaining the sorted order of the list.

2. **Handling of Equal Values**: The use of `bisect.bisect_right` ensures that if the specified value to be inserted is equal to an existing value in the list, the insertion point will be after all occurrences of that value. This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement that the insertion point maintains the order.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases, such as:
   - Inserting a value smaller than the smallest element (returns index 0).
   - Inserting a value larger than the largest element (returns the index equal to the length of the list).
   - Inserting a value that fits in the middle of the sorted list at the right position.

4. **No Modification of Original List**: The function does not modify the original sorted list, which is an implicit requirement when just finding an insertion point.

Overall, the implementation adheres strictly to the problem description, and the assertions included provide further validation that the function works as intended for various scenarios. There are no edge cases presented by the problem description that the implementation fails to address.
