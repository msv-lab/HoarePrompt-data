Correctness: **True**.

The program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function returns the index at which the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order. 

Examining the provided test cases:
1. For the input `([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the function correctly returns `4`, meaning `6` should be placed after `5`.
2. For the input `([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, it returns `2`, indicating `3` should be inserted between `2` and `4`.
3. For the input `([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the result is again `4`, confirming that `7` should be appended at the end of the list.

The function handles all cases correctly, returning the precise index for insertion in all scenarios based on the sorted order. Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem description.
