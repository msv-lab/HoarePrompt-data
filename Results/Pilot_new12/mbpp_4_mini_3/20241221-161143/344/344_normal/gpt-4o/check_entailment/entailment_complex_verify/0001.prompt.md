You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly utilizes the `bisect.bisect_right` method to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The `bisect_right` method returns the index at which the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order, effectively indicating where to place the value if it were to be added to the list.

Let's analyze the provided assertions:
- For the input `[1, 2, 4, 5]` with the value `6`, `bisect_right` returns `4`, which is correct since `6` should be placed after `5`.
- For `[1, 2, 4, 5]` with the value `3`, it returns `2`, indicating that `3` should be placed between `2` and `4`, which is also correct.
- For the input `[1, 2, 4, 5]` with the value `7`, it returns `4`, showing that `7` would be placed after `5`, consistent with the sorted order.

Since these examples cover various cases (greater than all, between two elements, and greater than the last element in the list) and I cannot think of any other edge cases where this implementation would fail, the function can be considered correctly implemented.

Hence, the final conclusion is that the program correctly solves the problem as stated.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of elements sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is the element to be inserted.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index at which the 'value' can be inserted in 'sorted_list' while maintaining the sorted order, using bisect.bisect_right
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of elements (`sorted_list`) and a value (`value`) to be inserted. It returns the index at which this value can be inserted into the list to maintain the list's sorted order. The function ensures that if `value` is equal to existing elements in the list, it returns the index to insert `value` after those elements. It effectively utilizes the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module for this purpose. This function does not modify the original list; it only computes and returns the insertion index. Edge cases such as inserting `value` less than all existing elements or greater than all elements are handled correctly by returning appropriate indices (0 and the length of the list, respectively).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
