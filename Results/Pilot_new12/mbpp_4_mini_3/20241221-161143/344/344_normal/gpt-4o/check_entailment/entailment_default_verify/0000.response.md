Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method to find the insertion index for a specified value in a sorted list. The test cases provided validate the functionality of the program: 

1. The insertion point for the value `6` is correctly returned as `4`, indicating that it should be placed after `5`.
2. For the value `3`, the program returns `2`, which is the correct insertion point between `2` and `4`.
3. Lastly, for the value `7`, it returns `4`, which is accurate, as `7` should go at the end of the list. 

Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function maintains the sorted order and does not modify the original list, effectively handling edge cases. Therefore, based on the provided information, the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.
