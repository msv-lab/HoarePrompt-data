Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right` to determine the appropriate insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The program's behavior aligns with the problem description, as evidenced by the annotated version. The annotations confirm that the `sorted_list` is indeed sorted in non-decreasing order and that the `value` is meant to be inserted into this list. 

The assertions in the program further demonstrate the correctness of `func_1` across various scenarios, confirming that it handles cases where the value is less than, between, and greater than the elements in the list. The annotations reinforce that the return value is intended to indicate the insertion point while maintaining the listâ€™s sorted order.

Overall, since the function passes all provided assertions and adheres to the problem requirements, the conclusion that the program is correct remains valid.
