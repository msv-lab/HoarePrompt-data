Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function to determine the appropriate insertion index for a value in a sorted list. 

- The function's behavior is consistent with the requirements: it places the value after any existing values equal to it, thus maintaining the sorted order.
- The assertions demonstrate the basic expected behavior:
  - Inserting `6` into the list `[1, 2, 4, 5]` returns `4`, which is the correct index as `6` is greater than all current elements.
  - Inserting `3` returns `2`, indicating that `3` fits between `2` and `4`.
  - Inserting `7` also correctly returns `4`, placing `7` after all other elements.

The output hints confirm that edge cases are properly handled: 
- If the `value` is less than all existing elements, it returns `0`.
- If the `value` is greater than all existing elements, it correctly returns the length of the list.

The assumption that inputs will be valid negates concerns about handling incompatible types or empty lists. Therefore, the program is designed to satisfy the problem description for all valid potential cases.
