Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly utilizes the `bisect.bisect_right` method to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The `bisect_right` method returns the index at which the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order, effectively indicating where to place the value if it were to be added to the list.

Let's analyze the provided assertions:
- For the input `[1, 2, 4, 5]` with the value `6`, `bisect_right` returns `4`, which is correct since `6` should be placed after `5`.
- For `[1, 2, 4, 5]` with the value `3`, it returns `2`, indicating that `3` should be placed between `2` and `4`, which is also correct.
- For the input `[1, 2, 4, 5]` with the value `7`, it returns `4`, showing that `7` would be placed after `5`, consistent with the sorted order.

Since these examples cover various cases (greater than all, between two elements, and greater than the last element in the list) and I cannot think of any other edge cases where this implementation would fail, the function can be considered correctly implemented.

Hence, the final conclusion is that the program correctly solves the problem as stated.
