Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the intended functionality of locating the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The usage of `bisect.bisect_right` is appropriate, as it ensures that the function returns the correct index for insertion while maintaining the sorted order. 

The output hints align perfectly with both the problem description and the behavior of the function, confirming that edge cases are handled correctly. For example, the function properly returns `0` when inserting a value less than the smallest element and returns the length of the list when inserting a value greater than all existing elements, which is validated by the provided assertions.

Therefore, the function meets the requirements as outlined, and thus it is correct.
