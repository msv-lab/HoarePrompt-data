The given program aims to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order using the `bisect` module.

The implementation uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function to determine the index at which the `value` can be inserted into `sorted_list` such that the order of the list is maintained. According to the output hints, the function correctly handles cases where the `value` is equal to existing elements in the list by returning the index after those elements. The function should also accurately return indices for edge cases, such as when the `value` is less than all elements (which results in index 0) or greater than all elements (which results in the length of the sorted list).

Looking closely at the provided assertions:
- For the input `(1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, the index `4` is correct since `6` should be placed at the end.
- For the input `(1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, the index `2` is correct as `3` should be inserted between `2` and `4`.
- For the input `(1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, the index `4` is correct since `7` should also be placed at the end.

All assertions return expected results, confirming that the program functions as described in the problem statement. The added edge cases are also appropriately handled since the function does not modify the original list, only computes the insertion index.

Thus, after reviewing both program logic and output hints, the program adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description and correctly handles all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
