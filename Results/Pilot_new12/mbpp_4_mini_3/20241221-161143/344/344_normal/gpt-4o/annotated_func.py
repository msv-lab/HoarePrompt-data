#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of elements sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is the element to be inserted.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index at which the 'value' can be inserted in 'sorted_list' while maintaining the sorted order, using bisect.bisect_right
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of elements (`sorted_list`) and a value (`value`) to be inserted. It returns the index at which this value can be inserted into the list to maintain the list's sorted order. The function ensures that if `value` is equal to existing elements in the list, it returns the index to insert `value` after those elements. It effectively utilizes the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module for this purpose. This function does not modify the original list; it only computes and returns the insertion index. Edge cases such as inserting `value` less than all existing elements or greater than all elements are handled correctly by returning appropriate indices (0 and the length of the list, respectively).
