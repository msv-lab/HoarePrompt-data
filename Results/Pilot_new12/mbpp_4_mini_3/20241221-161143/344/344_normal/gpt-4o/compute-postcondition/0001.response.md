The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list` and `value`. `sorted_list` is a list of elements that are sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value` is the element to be inserted. After executing the function body, it returns the index at which `value` can be inserted in `sorted_list` while maintaining the sorted order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list and a value, and return the appropriate index for inserting that value to keep the list sorted.

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list and a value, and returns the index at which the value can be inserted in the sorted list while maintaining the sorted order.**
