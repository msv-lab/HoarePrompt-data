#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is equal to 2 * n * (n + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n` and generates a list of the first `n` even numbers. It then computes the sum of the cubes of these even numbers (`even_numbers`). The final result returned by the function is this sum, `cube_sum`. The comments suggest that `cube_sum` can also be expressed mathematically as `2 * n * (n + 1)`, which is a concise formula for the output, although this relationship should be explicitly validated through the function's calculations. The function does not handle any potential edge cases for `n` being 0, which would return `0`, as the summation of cubes of an empty list should yield `0`. Overall, the function effectively calculates the cube sum of even numbers up to `2n` when `n` is a positive integer or returns `0` when `n` is `0`.
