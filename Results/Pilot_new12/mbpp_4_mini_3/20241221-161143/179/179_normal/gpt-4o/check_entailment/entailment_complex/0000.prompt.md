You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is equal to 2 * n * (n + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n` and generates a list of the first `n` even numbers. It then computes the sum of the cubes of these even numbers (`even_numbers`). The final result returned by the function is this sum, `cube_sum`. The comments suggest that `cube_sum` can also be expressed mathematically as `2 * n * (n + 1)`, which is a concise formula for the output, although this relationship should be explicitly validated through the function's calculations. The function does not handle any potential edge cases for `n` being 0, which would return `0`, as the summation of cubes of an empty list should yield `0`. Overall, the function effectively calculates the cube sum of even numbers up to `2n` when `n` is a positive integer or returns `0` when `n` is `0`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
