Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge case when `n` is 0. According to the problem description, the cube sum of the first `0` even natural numbers should be `0`, as there are no even numbers to sum. However, the current implementation does not explicitly check for this case, and it will return a sum of `0` correctly due to the list comprehension creating an empty list, but this behavior is not validated in the assertions provided. The assertions given only test positive values of `n`.

Thus, although the code works for `n > 0`, it does not demonstrate that it correctly handles every potential case as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it does not have an assertion or test to confirm the output for `n = 0`. Without this validation, we must conclude that the program is incorrect for not explicitly addressing all cases outlined in the problem description.
