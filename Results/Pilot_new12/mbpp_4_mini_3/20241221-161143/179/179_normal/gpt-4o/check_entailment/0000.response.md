Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. However, it does not handle the case when `n` is zero. According to the problem description, if `n=0`, the function should ideally return `0` since there are no even natural numbers to consider. 

If we call `func_1(0)`, the program will produce an empty list for `even_numbers` (`[]`), and the sum of cubes of the empty list will be `0`, which is correct. However, since the code does not include any test cases or assertions for `n=0`, it cannot be deemed fully correct.

Additionally, the cube sum results provided in the assertions do not consider this edge case, making the program incomplete. Hence, it is not correct for every potential case regarding cube sums.
