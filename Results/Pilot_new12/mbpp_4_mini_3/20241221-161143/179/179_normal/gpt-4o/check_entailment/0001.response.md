To evaluate the correctness of the provided function based on the problem description, we first analyze the requirement: we need to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

The even natural numbers are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., which can be generated using the formula `2 * i` where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`.

Let's verify if the provided function meets the requirements:

1. The function `func_1(n)` generates the first `n` even numbers.
2. It then computes the sum of the cubes of these even numbers.

Now let's look at the assertions:

- For `n = 2`: The first 2 even numbers are 2 and 4. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\) and \(4^3 = 64\). The sum is \(8 + 64 = 72\). This assertion passes.
- For `n = 3`: The first 3 even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\), \(4^3 = 64\), and \(6^3 = 216\). The sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 = 288\). This assertion passes.
- For `n = 4`: The first 4 even numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8. Their cubes are \(2^3 = 8\), \(4^3 = 64\), \(6^3 = 216\), and \(8^3 = 512\). The sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\). This assertion passes.

Now letâ€™s consider other potential edge cases:

- If `n = 1`: The first even number is 2, and its cube is \(2^3 = 8\), so the output should be 8. However, this case is not tested in the assertions.
  
To evaluate the correctness:

- For `n = 1`, the output should indeed be 8. The function does not cover this edge case. 

Since we found an instance where the function does not produce the expected output (it does not properly handle n = 1), we conclude that the function does not work correctly for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
