The annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The function `func_1(n)`:

1. Generates the first `n` even natural numbers using the expression `[(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. 
2. Computes the sum of the cubes of these even numbers using the expression `sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
3. Returns the computed sum.

Now, let's analyze the assertions given:

- For `func_1(2)`, the first two even natural numbers are `2` and `4`, and their cubes are `2^3 = 8` and `4^3 = 64`. Thus, the cube sum is `8 + 64 = 72`, which matches the assertion.
- For `func_1(3)`, the first three even natural numbers are `2`, `4`, and `6`. Their cubes are `8`, `64`, and `216`, respectively, giving a cube sum of `8 + 64 + 216 = 288`, which also matches the assertion.
- For `func_1(4)`, the first four even natural numbers are `2`, `4`, `6`, and `8`. Their cubes are `8`, `64`, `216`, and `512`, respectively, yielding a cube sum of `8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`, confirming the assertion.

Additionally, the comments correctly convey that when `n` is 0, the function would return `0`, which aligns with the understanding that the sum of cubes of an empty list is indeed `0`.

The formula provided in the comments about the relationship between the cube sum and `2 * n * (n + 1)` is mathematically misleading regarding cubing even numbers. The program correctly implements the calculation instead of using this incorrect formula directly. 

Thus, since the function adheres to the problem description by accurately calculating the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers for the valid input cases (including returning `0` when `n` is `0`), the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
