Explanation: The provided program is intended to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The function generates the first `n` even numbers correctly by computing `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. It then calculates the cube of each number in this list and sums them up, which is handled correctly with `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`.

However, the output hints reveal that the function does not explicitly handle the case when `n` is `0`. According to the description, when `n` is `0`, the function should return `0`, as there are no even natural numbers to consider. However, the code does not address this edge case, and as a result, calling `func_1(0)` would lead to an empty list and thus return `0`, which is logically correct but not explicitly handled by the code. Yet, since the program's logic holds for positive integers as expected and it effectively calculates the sum of cubes for `n > 0`, it does not produce incorrect results.

Thus, while the code behaves as desired for positive integers and defaults to returning `0` correctly for `n = 0`, no explicit check was placed for this scenario. However, since we assume valid input per description and the function yields the correct output for all expected cases, we conclude the function is essentially correct.

Correctness: **True**.
