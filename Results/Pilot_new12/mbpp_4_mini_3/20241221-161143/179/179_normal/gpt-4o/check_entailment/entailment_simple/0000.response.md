The provided program is designed to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's analyze this in detail based on the problem description:

1. **Understanding the Requirements**:
   - The task is to compute the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that:
     - Generates the first `n` even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This generates the list `[2, 4, ..., 2*n]`.
     - Computes the sum of the cubes of these even numbers: `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`.
     - Returns `cube_sum`.

3. **Example Outputs**:
   - For `n = 2`: The first two even natural numbers are `[2, 4]`. Their cubes are `2^3 = 8` and `4^3 = 64`. Their sum is `8 + 64 = 72`, which matches the assertion `assert func_1(2) == 72`.
   - For `n = 3`: The first three even natural numbers are `[2, 4, 6]`. Their cubes are `8`, `64`, and `216`, summing to `288`, matching `assert func_1(3) == 288`.
   - For `n = 4`: The first four even natural numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. Their cubes are `8`, `64`, `216`, and `512`, which sum to `800`, matching `assert func_1(4) == 800`.

4. **Correctness Validation**:
   - The implementation follows the problem requirements accurately. It correctly generates the first `n` even natural numbers, computes their cubes, and sums them up to return the correct result.

Therefore, based on this evaluation, the program adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
