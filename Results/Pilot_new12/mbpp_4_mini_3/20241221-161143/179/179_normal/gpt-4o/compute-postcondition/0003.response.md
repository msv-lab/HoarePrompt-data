The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it calculates `cube_sum`, which is equal to \(2 \times n \times (n + 1)\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the value of `cube_sum` computed as \(2 \times n \times (n + 1)\).

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a non-negative integer, and returns the value of cube_sum calculated as 2 * n * (n + 1).**
