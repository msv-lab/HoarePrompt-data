The code creates a list of even numbers by multiplying each integer in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) by 2. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the value of `even_numbers` will be a list containing `2`, `4`, up to `2 * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `even_numbers` is a list of even numbers equal to `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2 * n]` (where the last element is `2 * n`).**
