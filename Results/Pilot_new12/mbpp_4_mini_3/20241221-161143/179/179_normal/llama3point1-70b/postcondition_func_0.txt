The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 to `n * 2`. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0, since there are no even integers in that range. The function effectively handles the specified range of even integers as described, without any additional checks for negative inputs, as `n` is assumed to be non-negative.
