Explanation: The code is designed to calculate the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers by generating a range of even numbers from 2 to `n * 2` and summing their cubes. The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior, affirming that it handles non-negative integers appropriately and returns 0 for an input of 0, which is consistent with the problem description. Since the function correctly computes the cube sum for all valid non-negative integers, and there are no edge cases noted that would cause it to fail, the program adheres to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
