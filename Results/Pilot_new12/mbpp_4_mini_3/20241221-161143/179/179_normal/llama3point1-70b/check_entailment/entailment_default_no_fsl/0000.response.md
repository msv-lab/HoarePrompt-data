Correctness: **True** 

The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The program initializes a range from 2 to `n * 2`, stepping by 2, which accurately captures all even numbers within that range. The use of a generator expression within the `sum` function ensures that the cubes of these even integers are computed and accumulated correctly.

The output hints confirm that for an input of `0`, the function will return `0`, which is the expected behavior since there are no even integers to sum. For any positive integer `n`, the code correctly computes the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even numbers. 

Given the assumption that `n` will always be a non-negative integer, the function handles all possible cases defined by the problem description. Therefore, there are no cases where the function does not work as expected.
