Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first 'n' even natural numbers. The range used in the function starts from 2 and goes up to `n * 2 + 1` with a step of 2, which generates the first 'n' even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., up to the `n`-th even number (2n). The cubes of these numbers are then summed together using the `sum()` function.

To illustrate why the function is correct, let's consider a few examples:

- For `n = 1`, the sum of the first 1 even natural number (which is 2) cubed is \(2^3 = 8\). The function returns 8.
- For `n = 2`, the even numbers are 2 and 4, so the sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\). The function returns 72.
- For `n = 3`, the even numbers are 2, 4, and 6; thus, the sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\). The function returns 288.

The function accounts for all edge cases such as:
- If `n` is 0, it returns 0 because there are no even numbers to sum (as the range would be empty).
- If `n` is a positive integer, it correctly sums the cubes of the first 'n' even numbers.

Since the function passes various tests and handles different input scenarios as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the function is correct.

Hence, the answer is:
Correctness: **True**
