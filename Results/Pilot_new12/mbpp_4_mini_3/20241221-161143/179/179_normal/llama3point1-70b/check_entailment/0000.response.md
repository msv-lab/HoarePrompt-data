Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

The logic used in the code involves generating even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2` by using a range that increments by 2, which correctly captures the first `n` even natural numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 2n). 

The comprehension `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` generates the cubes of these even numbers, and the `sum()` function accurately aggregates these cubes. 

For any positive integer `n`, this approach yields the expected result, and all potential corner cases (including when `n` is 0, where it rightly returns 0) are handled properly. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description in all valid cases.
