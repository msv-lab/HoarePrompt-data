Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to calculate the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers, but it does so incorrectly. Specifically, the issue arises from how the range for summing the cubes is defined:

1. The program uses `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)`, which generates all even numbers from 2 up to (and including) `n * 2`. For example, if n = 3, this range yields [2, 4, 6].
2. However, the task is to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers, which are [2, 4, 6] for n = 3. Since there are exactly n even natural numbers, the program will correctly compute the sum of these numbers for n >= 1. But the proper range to use should actually stop at `2 * n`, which is achieved by using `range(2, 2 * n + 1, 2)`.

Despite generating even numbers correctly, there is a misconception regarding what "first n even natural numbers" means. The correct function should consider only n terms, which means the range should be anchored to generate only those first n terms.

Thus, the program does not consistently fulfill the requirement as stated in the problem description, which ultimately leads to it not being considered correct.
