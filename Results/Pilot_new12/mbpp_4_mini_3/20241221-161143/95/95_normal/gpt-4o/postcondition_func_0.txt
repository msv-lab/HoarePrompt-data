The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string, and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within that string `s`. The function correctly handles cases where 'std' appears multiple times, including overlapping occurrences. It effectively returns 0 if 'std' does not exist in `s` or if `s` is empty. There are no constraints or special handling for different types of strings passed in, meaning the function assumes `s` is a valid string. The incoming string can contain any characters, and the output will always be a non-negative integer representing the count of 'std'.
