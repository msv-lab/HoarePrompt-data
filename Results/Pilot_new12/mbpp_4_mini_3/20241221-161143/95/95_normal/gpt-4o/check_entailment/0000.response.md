Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string. The implementation uses Python's built-in `count` method for strings, which is well-suited for this task. It accurately handles various cases, including:

1. Strings with multiple non-overlapping occurrences of 'std' (e.g., 'letstdlenstdporstd' returns 3).
2. Strings with a single occurrence (e.g., 'truststdsolensporsd' returns 1).
3. Strings that contain 'std' at the beginning or end (e.g., 'stds' returns 1).
4. Empty strings, which correctly return 0 occurrences.

All test cases provided confirm that the function behaves as expected, and no edge cases are missed. Thus, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
