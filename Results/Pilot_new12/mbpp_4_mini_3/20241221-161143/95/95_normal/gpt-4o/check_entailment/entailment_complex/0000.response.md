Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and uses the built-in string method `count` to determine the number of occurrences of the substring 'std'. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the relevant features that confirm the correctness:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The use of `s.count('std')` effectively counts all non-overlapping occurrences of 'std' in the string `s`. This aligns with the requirement to count how many times 'std' appears.

2. **Correct Handling of Different Cases**:
    - The function correctly returns 0 when the input string is empty (`func_1('') == 0`).
    - It correctly returns counts > 0 for various strings where 'std' appears multiple times (e.g., `func_1('letstdlenstdporstd') == 3` indicates 'std' appears three times).
    
3. **Validity of Input**: The description states that the input string will always be valid. The implementation does not require additional error handling (e.g., datatype validation) since it assumes the input will be a string.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases appropriately, which are verified by the provided assertions.

The overall implementation meets the criteria set out in the problem description without any discrepancies. Thus, it can be confidently stated that the program is correct.
