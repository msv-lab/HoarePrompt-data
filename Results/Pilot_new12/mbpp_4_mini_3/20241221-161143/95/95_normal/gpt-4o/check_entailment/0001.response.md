Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in various input strings. I analyzed the test cases provided:

1. 'letstdlenstdporstd' should return 3, as 'std' occurs three times.
2. 'truststdsolensporsd' should return 1, as 'std' occurs once.
3. 'makestdsostdworthit' should return 2, as 'std' occurs twice.
4. 'stds' should return 1, as the substring 'std' appears once at the start.
5. An empty string '' should return 0, as there are no occurrences.

Additionally, the function uses Python's built-in string method `count`, which reliably counts non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring. There are no edge cases present that would lead to incorrect behavior in any of the described scenarios, confirming that the implementation fulfills the problem requirements.
