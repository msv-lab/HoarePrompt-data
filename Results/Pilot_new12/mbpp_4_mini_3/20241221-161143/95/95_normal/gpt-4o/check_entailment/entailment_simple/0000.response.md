Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string `s`. 

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. The function uses Python's built-in string method `count()`, which accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring ('std' in this case).
2. The assertions provided test various cases:
   - The first assertion checks for 3 occurrences in 'letstdlenstdporstd'.
   - The second checks for 1 occurrence in 'truststdsolensporsd'.
   - The third checks for 2 occurrences in 'makestdsostdworthit'.
   - The fourth checks for 1 occurrence with the string 'std' itself.
   - The last assertion checks that an empty string returns a count of 0.
3. Each assertion aligns with the expected output outlined in the problem description, demonstrating that the function fulfills the requirement of counting occurrences of 'std'.

Since all these aspects confirm that the function performs according to the requirements stated in the problem description, the correctness of the program is valid.
