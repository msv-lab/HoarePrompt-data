Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is intended to count the occurrences of the substring 'std' within the provided string `s`. However, the output hints claim that the function handles cases where 'std' appears multiple times, including overlapping occurrences. This is not accurate because the string method `count()` does not account for overlapping substrings.

For instance, if we test the input string 'stdstd', the expected output should be 2 because 'std' occurs starting from index 0 and then starting from index 3. However, using `s.count('std')` will return 1 for this input, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, specifically overlapping occurrences of 'std'.
