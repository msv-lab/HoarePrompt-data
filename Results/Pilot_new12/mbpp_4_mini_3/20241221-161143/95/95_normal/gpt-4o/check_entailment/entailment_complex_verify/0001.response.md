Final: **True**

The program `func_1` accurately counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string, as demonstrated by the provided test cases. The annotations support this conclusion, confirming that the function correctly identifies both the presence and absence of the target substring. All assertions have been verified against the expected outcomes, validating the function's correctness.

The explanation accompanying the original assessment accurately details the functionality of `func_1`, emphasizing the reliability of the built-in method `count` for this specific scenario. Since there are no edge cases or special handling requirements specified in the problem description, the function's behavior remains aligned with the expectations laid out.

Thus, the original assessment of the programâ€™s correctness is upheld as accurate.
