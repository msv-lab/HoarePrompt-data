To assess the correctness of the provided function `func_1`, we need to analyze the problem description, the code implementation, and the given output hints.

The problem description states that the function should count the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string.

The code implementation is:
```python
def func_1(s: str) -> int:
    return s.count('std')
```

The output hints describe the function accurately: it counts occurrences of 'std', including handling cases for overlapping occurrences, and returns 0 for an empty string or if 'std' is not present. 

Key observations:
1. The function uses `s.count('std')`, which is a built-in method that counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string. This means that if the string has overlapping occurrences of 'std', such as "stdstd", only the first occurrence will be counted, which is not what the problem description requires in terms of potentially counting overlapping instances.

2. The output hints mention that the function counts overlapping occurrences, which is inaccurate since the `count` method does not consider overlaps.

Given this discrepancy, there is a potential case where the implementation does not conform to the problem's requirements. 

For example:
- For the input `"stdstd"`, which contains two overlapping occurrences of 'std', the function would return 2 instead of 3, which would be expected if the function counted overlapping instances.

Based on this analysis, the program does not satisfy the problem description in the case of overlapping occurrences.

Correctness: **False**.
