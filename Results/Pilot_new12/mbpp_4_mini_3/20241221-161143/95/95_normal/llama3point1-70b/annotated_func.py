#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.count('std')
    #The program returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns an integer representing the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the string `s`. It handles cases where `s` is empty or does not contain 'std' by returning 0, as the `count` method will yield 0 in such scenarios. The function does not alter the input string `s`.
