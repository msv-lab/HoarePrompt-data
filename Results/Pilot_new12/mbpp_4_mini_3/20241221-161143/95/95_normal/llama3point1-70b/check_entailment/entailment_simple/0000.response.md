Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string.
  
2. **Count Method**: Inside the function, the method `s.count('std')` is used. This method counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' within the string `s`. 

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the result of this count, which directly corresponds to what is required by the problem description: to count how many times the string 'std' appears in the given string.

4. **Assumptions on Input**: The problem states we can assume that input will be valid. Therefore, we do not need to handle any invalid inputs or edge cases (like non-strings or empty strings) as per the given constraints. 

Thus, the function consistently meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, making it correct.
