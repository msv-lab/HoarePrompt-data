Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string `s`. The Python method `s.count('std')` does exactly what the problem description specifies: it counts the non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'std' and handles cases such as when the input string is empty or does not contain 'std' by returning 0, which is the expected behavior. 

Since the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases and does not leave any edge cases unhandled, it is deemed correct.
