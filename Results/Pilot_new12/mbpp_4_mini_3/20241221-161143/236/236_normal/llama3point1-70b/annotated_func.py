#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers or comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'nums' is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers or elements that can be compared. It returns `True` if the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `nums` may be empty or contain non-comparable elements, which could lead to unintended results. In the context of empty lists, it will return `True`, as an empty list is considered sorted by convention. Overall, the function effectively checks for sortedness but lacks comprehensive handling for edge cases.
