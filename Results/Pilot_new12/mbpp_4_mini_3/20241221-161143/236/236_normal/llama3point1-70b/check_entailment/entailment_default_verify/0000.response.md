Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly checks whether the specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the input list `nums` to its sorted version. The use of the equality operator ensures that it returns `True` only when the order and values of elements in `nums` match those of `sorted(nums)`. 

The program handles edge cases appropriately, including:
- It returns `True` for an empty list, which is the correct behavior since an empty list is conventionally considered sorted.
- It also returns `True` for a single-element list, and for lists with equal elements.

While it's noted in the output hints that the function does not handle cases with non-comparable elements, the assumption is that the input will be validâ€”a condition that elevates the correctness of the program in this context. Therefore, given the consistent performance of the program against the conditions and expectations set forth in the problem description, the assessment of correctness remains justified.
