Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list (`nums`) as input and checks if it is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. 

- If `nums` is sorted, the comparison (`nums == sorted(nums)`) will return `True`.
- If `nums` is not sorted, it will return `False`.
- For an empty list, the function will also return `True` since an empty list is considered sorted by convention.

The annotations mention that the function does not handle edge cases, but the assumption that the input will always be valid means it suffices for the correctness of the function as per the given requirements. It effectively serves the purpose of checking whether the list is sorted as specified in the problem description. 

Thus, the function meets the criteria set by the problem description under the provided assumptions about input validity.
