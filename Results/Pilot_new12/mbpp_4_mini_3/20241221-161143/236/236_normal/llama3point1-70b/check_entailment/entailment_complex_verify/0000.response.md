Final: **True** 

The original assessment that the program is correct is accurate based on both the problem description and the provided annotations. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted equivalent. The annotations confirm that it handles edge cases, such as returning `True` for empty lists and lists with one element. Additionally, the assumption that the input will always be a valid list of comparable elements means that the lack of comprehensive handling for edge cases (like non-comparable elements) does not affect the correctness of the function within its given constraints. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the program effectively fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
