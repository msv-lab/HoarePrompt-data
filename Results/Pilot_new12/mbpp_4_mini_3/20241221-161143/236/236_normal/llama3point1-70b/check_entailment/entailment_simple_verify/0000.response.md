Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The program checks whether the list `nums` is sorted by comparing it directly to its sorted version with `sorted(nums)`. The annotated version confirms that before the function call, `nums` is expected to be a list of integers or comparable elements, which aligns with the problem description. 

The annotations clarify that the program returns a boolean value indicating whether `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order, further supporting the original assessment. Edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with all equal elements are handled properly according to the problem description. Since every aspect of the program adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem, the correctness of the program remains validated.
