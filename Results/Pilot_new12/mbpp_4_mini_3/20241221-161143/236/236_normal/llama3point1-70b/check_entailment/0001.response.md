Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to a new sorted version of the list. Here's a breakdown of how the function behaves with different inputs:

1. **Empty List**: `func_1([])` returns `True` because an empty list is considered sorted.
2. **Single Element List**: `func_1([1])` returns `True` since a single element is also considered sorted.
3. **Sorted List**: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `True`, and similarly for any other sorted lists like `func_1([1, 1, 2])`.
4. **Unsorted List**: `func_1([3, 2, 1])` returns `False` correctly detecting that the list is not sorted.
5. **Mixed Types**: The function also correctly handles lists of comparable types and can differentiate between sorted and unsorted lists.

Since the function performs correctly across all the examined scenarios, I conclude that it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, it is correct in its implementation and logic.

Thus, the code works as expected for all potential input cases, making it correct.
