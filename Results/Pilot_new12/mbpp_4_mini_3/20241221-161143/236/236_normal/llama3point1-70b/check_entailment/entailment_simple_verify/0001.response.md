Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies the function `func_1` as behaving correctly according to the problem description, which is to check if a specified list is sorted. The annotations confirm that the function returns a boolean indicating whether the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version. 

The breakdown provided in the original assessment outlines various scenarios—empty lists, single element lists, sorted and unsorted lists—which all demonstrate the function's correctness. The program is designed to take inputs that are lists of integers or comparable elements, as stated in the annotation, and it performs its check accurately.

Since the function behaves as expected across all examined cases and the annotations align with the original assessment, I conclude that the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. Thus, the original assessment remains valid.
