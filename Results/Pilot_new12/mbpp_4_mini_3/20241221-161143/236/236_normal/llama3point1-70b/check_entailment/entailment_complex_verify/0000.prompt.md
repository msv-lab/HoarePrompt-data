You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It compares the list `nums` directly with its sorted version (using `sorted(nums)`), and since the equality operator will return `True` only if the elements and their order in `nums` match those in the sorted version, it accurately identifies whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Additionally, it handles edge cases correctly:
- An empty list is considered sorted.
- A list with one element is also considered sorted.
- Lists with equal elements are considered sorted.

Since all input cases correctly return whether the list is sorted according to the problem description, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers or comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'nums' is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers or elements that can be compared. It returns `True` if the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `nums` may be empty or contain non-comparable elements, which could lead to unintended results. In the context of empty lists, it will return `True`, as an empty list is considered sorted by convention. Overall, the function effectively checks for sortedness but lacks comprehensive handling for edge cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
