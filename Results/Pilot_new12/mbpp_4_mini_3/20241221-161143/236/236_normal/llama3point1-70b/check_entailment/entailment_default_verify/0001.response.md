Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly determines whether a given list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of the same list. It handles essential cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, sorted lists, and unsorted lists appropriately according to the problem description. 

While the output hints mention that the function does not handle non-comparable elements, it's stated that the function is expected to receive valid input that does not cause errors. Given this assumption and the fact that the function performs correctly for all specified input types, including returning `True` for empty lists, the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

Thus, the function demonstrates the required functionality as expected, justifying the conclusion of correctness.
