Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It compares the list `nums` directly with its sorted version (using `sorted(nums)`), and since the equality operator will return `True` only if the elements and their order in `nums` match those in the sorted version, it accurately identifies whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Additionally, it handles edge cases correctly:
- An empty list is considered sorted.
- A list with one element is also considered sorted.
- Lists with equal elements are considered sorted.

Since all input cases correctly return whether the list is sorted according to the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
