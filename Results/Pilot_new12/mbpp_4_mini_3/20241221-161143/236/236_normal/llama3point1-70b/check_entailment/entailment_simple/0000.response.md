Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that checks if a specified list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function achieves this by comparing the input list `nums` to the result of `sorted(nums)`, which is a built-in Python function that returns a new list containing the elements of `nums` in sorted order. If `nums` is equal to its sorted version, it means that `nums` was originally sorted, and the function returns `True`. If the two lists are not equal, it returns `False`.

Since the program strictly adheres to the requirements of checking whether the list is sorted and provides the correct boolean output based on this check, it fulfills the problem description accurately. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
