Correctness: **False**

The program correctly checks if the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order for valid inputs. However, the output hints suggest that the function does not handle cases where `nums` may contain non-comparable elements, which raises concerns about its correctness. 

For example, if `nums` contains both integers and strings (e.g., `nums = [1, 2, '3']`), the function will fail to sort properly and will raise a TypeError. This indicates that the function lacks comprehensive handling for edge cases regarding the comparability of elements in the list.

Additionally, the output hints mention that it handles empty lists by returning `True`, which is consistent with conventional definitions of sortedness. However, since it does not deal with non-comparable elements, the function fails in this aspect, making it incorrect.
