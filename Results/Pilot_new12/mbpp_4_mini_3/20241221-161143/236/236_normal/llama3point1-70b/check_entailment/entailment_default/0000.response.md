The code provided defines a function `func_1` that checks if a list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to the result of `sorted(nums)`. The output hints clarify that the function returns `True` for an empty list, which is considered sorted by convention.

The function handles valid input (a list) correctly and accurately determines sortedness. However, it lacks specific handling for cases where the list may contain non-comparable elements. While we assume that the input will always be valid, the hint suggests that this could lead to unintended results if the list contains incompatible types. 
However, since the assumption is that user input will be valid (as specified in the task), edge cases like non-comparable elements can be disregarded for this task. Thus, it will work correctly for the expected input types.

Based on the above analysis, I conclude that the function meets the problem description's requirements effectively.

Correctness: **True**.
