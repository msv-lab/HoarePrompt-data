You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to a new sorted version of the list. Here's a breakdown of how the function behaves with different inputs:

1. **Empty List**: `func_1([])` returns `True` because an empty list is considered sorted.
2. **Single Element List**: `func_1([1])` returns `True` since a single element is also considered sorted.
3. **Sorted List**: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `True`, and similarly for any other sorted lists like `func_1([1, 1, 2])`.
4. **Unsorted List**: `func_1([3, 2, 1])` returns `False` correctly detecting that the list is not sorted.
5. **Mixed Types**: The function also correctly handles lists of comparable types and can differentiate between sorted and unsorted lists.

Since the function performs correctly across all the examined scenarios, I conclude that it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, it is correct in its implementation and logic.

Thus, the code works as expected for all potential input cases, making it correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers or elements that can be compared. It returns `True` if the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `nums` may be empty or contain non-comparable elements, which could lead to unintended results. In the context of empty lists, it will return `True`, as an empty list is considered sorted by convention. Overall, the function effectively checks for sortedness but lacks comprehensive handling for edge cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
