Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers or elements that can be compared. It returns `True` if the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `nums` may be empty or contain non-comparable elements, which could lead to unintended results. In the context of empty lists, it will return `True`, as an empty list is considered sorted by convention. Overall, the function effectively checks for sortedness but lacks comprehensive handling for edge cases.**
