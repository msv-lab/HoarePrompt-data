Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this using a simple loop that compares each element with the next one to ensure that the current element is not greater than the next. If any element is found to be greater than the following element, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. 

The function returns `True` if it completes the loop without finding any such case, indicating that the list is sorted.

The assertions included in the code serve as test cases that confirm the function's behavior:
1. An ascending sorted list returns `True`.
2. A list that is not sorted (with elements out of order) returns `False`.
3. Another unsorted list also returns `False`.

Since all provided scenarios comply with the problem requirements and no edge cases are left unhandled, the function is deemed correct according to the given problem description.
