Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description, which is to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Iterating Through the List**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through the list `lst` up to the second-to-last element. For each element at index `i`, it compares the current element `lst[i]` with the next element `lst[i + 1]`.

2. **Checking Order**: It checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If it finds any case where an element is greater than its successor, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.

3. **Return True for Sorted Lists**: If the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements (i.e., the `if` condition is never satisfied), the program concludes that the list is sorted and returns `True`.

4. **Handles Edge Cases**: The function behaves correctly for lists with fewer than two elements (i.e., empty lists or single-element lists), returning `True` since they are trivially sorted.

Overall, the logic correctly checks for non-decreasing order and meets the specifications laid out in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
