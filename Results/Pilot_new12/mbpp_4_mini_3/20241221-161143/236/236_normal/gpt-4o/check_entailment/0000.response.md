To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the given code step-by-step.

The problem requires a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.

The program contains the function `func_1(lst)` which checks if the list `lst` is sorted:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis of the Function:
1. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the next one.
2. If any element is greater than the following element, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.
3. If it completes the iteration without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

### Consideration of Edge Cases:
- An empty list should be considered sorted: `func_1([])` should return `True`.
- A single-element list should also be sorted: `func_1([5])` should return `True`.
- Lists with duplicate elements should be treated as sorted. For example, `func_1([1, 1, 1])` should return `True`.
- The function should correctly identify sorted lists, including those with negative numbers and mixed values, such as `func_1([-5, 0, 1, 2])`, which should return `True`.

### Checking against the examples:
- For the assert statements:
  - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True`: correct.
  - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False`: correct.
  - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False`: correct.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly identifies whether a list is sorted based on all potential test cases and meets the problem requirements for all tested scenarios. I can't find a case where the function fails to work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
