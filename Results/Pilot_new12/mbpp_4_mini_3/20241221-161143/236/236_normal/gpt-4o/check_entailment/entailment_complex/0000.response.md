Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` adheres to the problem description, which requires it to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The implementation works as follows:
1. It iterates through the list `lst` using a loop from the first element to the second-to-last element.
2. Within the loop, it compares each element `lst[i]` with the next element `lst[i + 1]`.
3. If it finds any instance where an element is greater than the subsequent element (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such instance, or if the list has fewer than two elements, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

This implementation covers all potential cases as described:
- **Sorted Lists**: It correctly identifies sorted lists, such as `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`.
- **Unsorted Lists**: It correctly identifies unsorted lists, like `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` and `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`.
- **Edge Cases**: It implicitly handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element by returning `True` since they are trivially sorted.

Thus, every assertion provided in the annotated program will hold true under the provided logic, confirming that the function meets the specifications of the problem description.
