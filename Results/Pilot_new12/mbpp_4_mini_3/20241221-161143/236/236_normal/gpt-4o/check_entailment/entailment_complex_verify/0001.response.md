Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The provided program effectively checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The logic implemented in the `func_1` function, which compares each element with the next one, aligns perfectly with the needs of the problem description. 

The provided assertions test various scenarios, and the annotations clarify that the function operates correctly by confirming that if any element is greater than the next, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. The annotations also reassure us that edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with a single element, are handled appropriately since they default to a `True` result.

Thus, given the consistent results from the assertions, the comprehensive logic in the function, and the thorough annotations confirming the program's intended behavior, we conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.
