Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately states that the program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` implements a straightforward loop that effectively compares each element to the next and returns `False` if it finds any adjacent elements out of order. The cases tested in the assertions validate this behavior:

1. An entirely ascending list correctly returns `True`.
2. A list with elements out of order returns `False`.
3. Another unsorted list also correctly returns `False`.

The output hints further confirm that the function handles edge cases appropriately, noting that for lists with fewer than two elements, the function returns `True`, treating them as trivially sorted. 

Considering that all provided scenarios align with the problem description and that no unhandled edge cases exist regarding valid input assumptions, the function is deemed correctly implemented and meets the criteria set out in the problem description. Therefore, the final assessment remains as originally stated.
