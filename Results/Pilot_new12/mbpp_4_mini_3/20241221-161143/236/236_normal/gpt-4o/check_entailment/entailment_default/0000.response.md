The code provided in the program correctly implements the logic to check whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The logic iterates through adjacent elements in the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If any such case is found, it returns False immediately, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns True, which indicates that the list is sorted.

The output hints confirm that the function is designed to check for sorted order and that it handles edge cases like empty lists and lists with a single element correctly by returning True.

From the assertions provided:
- `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` is sorted, so it returns True.
- `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` is not sorted, so it returns False.
- `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` is not sorted, so it returns False.

Given that the function correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases, including the edge cases described, I determine:

Correctness: **True**.
