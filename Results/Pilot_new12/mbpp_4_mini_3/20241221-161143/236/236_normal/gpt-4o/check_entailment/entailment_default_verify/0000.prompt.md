You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the given code step-by-step.

The problem requires a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.

The program contains the function `func_1(lst)` which checks if the list `lst` is sorted:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis of the Function:
1. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the next one.
2. If any element is greater than the following element, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.
3. If it completes the iteration without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

### Consideration of Edge Cases:
- An empty list should be considered sorted: `func_1([])` should return `True`.
- A single-element list should also be sorted: `func_1([5])` should return `True`.
- Lists with duplicate elements should be treated as sorted. For example, `func_1([1, 1, 1])` should return `True`.
- The function should correctly identify sorted lists, including those with negative numbers and mixed values, such as `func_1([-5, 0, 1, 2])`, which should return `True`.

### Checking against the examples:
- For the assert statements:
  - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True`: correct.
  - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False`: correct.
  - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False`: correct.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly identifies whether a list is sorted based on all potential test cases and meets the problem requirements for all tested scenarios. I can't find a case where the function fails to work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of elements that can be compared (like integers or strings). It checks if this list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it encounters any adjacent elements where the first is greater than the second, it returns False immediately. If no such pairs are found after checking all adjacent elements, or if the list contains fewer than 2 elements (making it trivially sorted), the function returns True. Thus, the final state of the program is that it indicates whether the input list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order or not, handling edge cases where the list is empty or contains a single element correctly by returning True.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
