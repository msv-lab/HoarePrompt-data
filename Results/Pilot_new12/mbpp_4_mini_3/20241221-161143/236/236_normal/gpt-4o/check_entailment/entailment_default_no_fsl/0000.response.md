Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the next one. If it finds any element greater than the subsequent one, it returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it does not find such a pair, it returns True, thus confirming the list is sorted. 

Additionally, it correctly handles edge cases where the list is empty or contains a single element by returning True, as these cases are trivially sorted. The output hints align with the code's functionality, and the assertions are consistent with the expected behavior for the examples provided. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
