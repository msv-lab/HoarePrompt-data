Final: **True**  

The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(lst)` correctly determines if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through the list and checking adjacent elements. The annotations confirm the behavior of the function at critical points: handling of lists with fewer than two elements appropriately, and the return values align with the expected outcomes as described in the problem statement. Thus, given the evidence from the annotations and the comprehensive reasoning in the original assessment, the program behaves correctly as required.
