The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of elements that can be compared (like integers or strings). It checks if this list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it encounters any adjacent elements where the first is greater than the second, it returns False immediately. If no such pairs are found after checking all adjacent elements, or if the list contains fewer than 2 elements (making it trivially sorted), the function returns True. Thus, the final state of the program is that it indicates whether the input list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order or not, handling edge cases where the list is empty or contains a single element correctly by returning True.
