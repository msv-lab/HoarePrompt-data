According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lst`. The expression `len(lst) - 1` dictates the range of the loop. For the loop to execute, `len(lst)` must be at least 2 (since `len(lst) - 1` must be at least 1 for the loop to have iterations). Therefore, `lst` needs to contain at least 2 elements.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be adjusted to reflect the current iteration index, which would start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
