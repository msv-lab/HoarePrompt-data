The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other (such as integers or strings). After executing the function body, it performs the following checks:

- Case 1: If the first element of `lst` is greater than the second element, the function returns `False`.
- Case 2: If any adjacent pair of elements in `lst` (i.e., `lst[i]` and `lst[i + 1]`) violates the non-decreasing order, the function returns `False`.
- Case 3: If none of the previous conditions are met, the function returns `False`.
- Case 4: If the function completes all checks without finding any out-of-order elements, it returns `True`, indicating that the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and check whether it is sorted in non-decreasing order, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, returns True if lst is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns False.**
