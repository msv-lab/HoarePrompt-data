#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be compared to each other (such as integers or strings).
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements sorted in non-decreasing order, and `i` is equal to `len(lst) - 2`, meaning it has gone through all adjacent pairs in the list without finding any out-of-order elements. If `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, `lst` is either empty or a single element.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list 'lst' is sorted in non-decreasing order, as indicated by the condition that all adjacent pairs in the list have been checked without finding any out-of-order elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of elements that can be compared (like integers or strings). It checks if this list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it encounters any adjacent elements where the first is greater than the second, it returns False immediately. If no such pairs are found after checking all adjacent elements, or if the list contains fewer than 2 elements (making it trivially sorted), the function returns True. Thus, the final state of the program is that it indicates whether the input list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order or not, handling edge cases where the list is empty or contains a single element correctly by returning True.
