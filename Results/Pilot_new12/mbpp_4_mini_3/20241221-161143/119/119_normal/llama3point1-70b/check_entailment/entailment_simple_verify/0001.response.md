Based on the problem description, the program needs to take two numbers and return a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. The function `func_1` implements this correctly by returning `(b, a)`, which matches the requirement specified.

The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **True**, arguing that it correctly implements the required functionality for all valid inputs, including negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. 

The annotated version of the code further supports this perspective by confirming that prior to invoking the function, both `a` and `b` are indeed numbers, and the return statement successfully outputs them in the correct order.

Given that:
- The function correctly adheres to the problem requirements.
- The annotations validate the function's operation without any errors in processing valid input.

I find the original assessment to be accurate. Therefore, there is no need for a change.

Final: **True**
