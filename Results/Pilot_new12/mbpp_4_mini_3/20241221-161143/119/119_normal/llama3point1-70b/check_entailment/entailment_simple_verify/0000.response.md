Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description by defining the function `func_1(a, b)`, which returns a tuple in the order of the second number first followed by the first number. The annotations confirm that the values of `a` and `b` are treated as numbers, and the output is correctly structured as `(b, a)`.

Additionally, the annotation explicitly states that "the program returns the values of b and a, where both are numbers," which is consistent with the problem description requiring a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. There are no indications of edge cases or assumptions that could invalidate this conclusion within the context provided.

Therefore, the function meets the criteria of the problem description, and the annotations support this conclusion, confirming the correctness of the original assessment.
