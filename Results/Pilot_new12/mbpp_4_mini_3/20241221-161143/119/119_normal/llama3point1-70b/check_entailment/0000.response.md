Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the specified functionality of taking two numbers as input and returning them in a tuple with the second number first followed by the first number. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes any two inputs `a` and `b` and returns `(b, a)` as required by the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs where this function would fail to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Thus, it is correct.
