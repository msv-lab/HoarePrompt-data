Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It takes in two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. The output hints confirm that the function performs this rearrangement correctly for any valid numerical input. 

Since the problem does not specify any additional constraints or validation checks that must be performed on the inputs (e.g., both numbers must be non-negative), and we are assuming valid inputs will always be provided, the program meets the requirements for all intended inputs. There is no indication in the output hints that there are any edge cases where the program would fail to behave as described. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases given the specified problem constraints.
