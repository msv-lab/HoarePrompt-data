Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes two numerical parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns them in a tuple as `(b, a)`. The output hints confirm that it correctly rearranges the inputs without any alteration and that it handles any numerical inputs, returning the values in the specified order. Since the problem description simply asks for the numbers to be returned in swapped order without any additional constraints or conditions to verify, the program meets the requirements for all potential valid numerical inputs. Thus, the function is correct in all cases as specified.
