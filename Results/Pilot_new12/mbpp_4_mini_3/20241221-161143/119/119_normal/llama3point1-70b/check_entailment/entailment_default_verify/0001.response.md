Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly fulfills the problem description that requires a function to accept two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` behaves as expected by accepting numerical parameters and returning them in the specified order, without altering the inputs. Additionally, the lack of input validation does not affect its correctness since the problem does not stipulate such requirements. Therefore, the function meets the expectations set forth in the problem description in all given scenarios.
