Correctness: **True**

The annotated program aligns correctly with the problem description, which specifies that the function must take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The function `func_1(a, b)` accurately implements this requirement by returning the values `(b, a)`. 

The explanation provided in the annotations clarifies that the function takes two numerical parameters, rearranges them, and outputs them in a tuple format. Since the problem description assumes valid numerical inputs (as per the explicit criteria), there are no concerns regarding input validation or types in this context.

Thus, the function consistently returns the required output format as specified in the problem description, confirming its correctness.
