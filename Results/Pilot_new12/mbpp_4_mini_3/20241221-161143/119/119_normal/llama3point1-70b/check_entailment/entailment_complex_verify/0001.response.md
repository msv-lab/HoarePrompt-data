Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately states that the program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two numerical inputs `a` and `b`, and the annotated version confirms that it returns a tuple containing the values of `b` first and then `a`, consistent with the specified output format. The annotations also clarify that the function correctly accepts numerical inputs and rearranges them as required without imposing further validation, which aligns with the assumption that valid inputs will always be provided. Therefore, the reasoning from the original assessment remains valid, affirming that the program is correct in fulfilling its intended purpose.
