Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two numbers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple with the second number first and then the first number. 

For all possible inputs, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero, the program correctly outputs the tuple in the specified order. Hence, I cannot find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the function meets the problem's requirements in every situation.
