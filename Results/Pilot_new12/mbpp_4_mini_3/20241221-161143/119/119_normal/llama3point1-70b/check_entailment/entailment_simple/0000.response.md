Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. According to the description, the function should take two numbers as input and return a tuple that contains the second number followed by the first number. 

Let's analyze the provided function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
```

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
2. It uses the `return` statement to create a tuple `(b, a)`. In Python, returning multiple values separated by a comma automatically creates a tuple.
3. Therefore, the function correctly returns the second number (`b`) first and then the first number (`a`), as required by the problem description.

Since the function adheres to the stated requirements and correctly returns the output in the specified order, we conclude that it is correct.
