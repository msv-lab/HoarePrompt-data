The function `func_1` accepts two numerical parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that order. The function correctly handles any numerical inputs provided to it but does not perform validations or checks, meaning it will return the values in their current state regardless of whether they meet any specific conditions (e.g., being integers, floats, or adhering to other numerical constraints). Therefore, it effectively rearranges the inputs without alteration.
