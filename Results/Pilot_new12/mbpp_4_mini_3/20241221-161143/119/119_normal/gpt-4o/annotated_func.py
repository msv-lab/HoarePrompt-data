#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are any two values.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a in reverse order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in reverse order. It does not modify the inputs `a` or `b`. The function's primary purpose is to swap the order of the two provided values upon return. There are no apparent edge cases or additional functionality needed, as the function consistently returns the values of its parameters in the specified order regardless of their types.
