Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly defines a function `func_1(a, b)` that returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in reverse order. The assertions provided in the code validate that the function can handle various inputs correctly by confirming that the output matches the expected tuple format (i.e., `(b, a)`). The output hints indicate that the function's primary purpose is to swap the order of the two provided values, and it is consistent in returning the correct result for the provided test cases. Additionally, since the input is assumed to be valid, there are no edge cases or potential issues that would lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
