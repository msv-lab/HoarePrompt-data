Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers as input and returns them in a tuple with the second number first, followed by the first number. The assert statements confirm that various test cases are handled correctly.

For example:
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is correct.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which is also correct.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, confirming correct behavior again.

Since the function handles all numbers (positive, negative, zero) without any missing logic or edge cases, and all test cases are successfully passing, the function operates according to the problem description in every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
