Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the specified functionality in the problem description. According to the description, the function `func_1` must return a tuple consisting of the second input number followed by the first input number. 

In the program, the function `func_1(a, b)` returns `b, a`, which corresponds to returning the second number first (as `b`) and then the first number (as `a`). This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement stated in the problem description.

The assertions provided in the program serve to validate the correctness of the function with different inputs. Each assertion checks that the output of the function matches the expected tuple format, confirming that the implementation behaves as required.

Since the function always swaps the order of the input parameters and returns them as specified, the program meets the problem's requirements in all potential cases based on the assumption of valid input. Thus, the implementation is correct.
