Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description by correctly implementing a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the specified test cases.

The annotated version of the code further supports this by clearly stating that the function reverses the order of the two parameters and returns them in a tuple, matching the expected output format. Additionally, the annotations confirm that the program does not alter the input values and correctly executes for valid inputs.

Given that the program performs as intended without any identified edge cases or failures and that the annotations align with the functionality described, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Thus, the final assessment remains intact as True.
