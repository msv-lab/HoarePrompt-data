Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the specified functionality by taking two numbers as inputs and returning a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function works as intended for those specific test cases. 

The hints confirm that the function consistently returns the parameters in the reverse order without modifying them. Since the program adheres to the problem description and there are no indications of edge cases or additional requirements that it fails to meet, we conclude that it is correct for all potential valid inputs.
