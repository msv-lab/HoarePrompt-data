Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two numbers and returns them in a tuple, with the second number first followed by the first number, which aligns perfectly with the specified requirement. The annotations further confirm this correctness, as they describe the state of the program before the function call and clarify that the function reverses the order of the input values as intended. All provided assertions verify that the function operates correctly for a variety of input values. Therefore, the function adheres to the requirements and behaves as expected, leading to the conclusion that the program is correct.
