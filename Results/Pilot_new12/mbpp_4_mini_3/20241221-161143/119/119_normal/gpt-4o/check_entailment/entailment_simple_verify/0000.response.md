Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description, which requires the definition of a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number first, followed by the first number. The implementation of the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns `(b, a)`, consistent with the requirement. 

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for multiple valid inputs, passing the tests (`func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, etc.). 

The annotated version of the code effectively describes the behavior of the function, stating that it returns the values of `b` and `a` in reverse order, which correctly aligns with the original problem description.

Therefore, since the evidence provided in the original assessment and the annotations supports the correctness of the program, I conclude that the program is indeed correct.
