Correctness: **True**.

The provided program definition and the function implementation correctly fulfill the problem description of returning a tuple where the second number comes first, followed by the first number. The assertions given (func_1(10, 20), func_1(15, 17), and func_1(100, 200)) confirm that the function behaves as expected for the specified inputs.

The function `func_1(a, b)` returns the tuple `(b, a)` directly, which aligns with the requirement. Since the function has been tested with multiple inputs that it handles correctly, and there do not appear to be any edge cases or scenarios where it would fail, the function is indeed correct.
