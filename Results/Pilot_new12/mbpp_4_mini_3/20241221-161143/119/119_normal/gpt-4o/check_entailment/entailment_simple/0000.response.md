Correctness: **True**

The provided program, specifically the function `func_1`, takes in two numbers `a` and `b` as arguments. It returns a tuple containing the second number `b` first and then the first number `a` as described in the problem statement. 

The assertions in the program verify that the function behaves as expected:
- For `func_1(10, 20)`, the expected output is `(20, 10)`, which is correct.
- For `func_1(15, 17)`, the expected output is `(17, 15)`, which is correct.
- For `func_1(100, 200)`, the expected output is `(200, 100)`, which is correct.

As per the problem description, the function successfully returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that would lead to incorrect behavior, and the assumptions state that the input will be valid.

Thus, the program adheres perfectly to the requirements outlined in the problem description.
