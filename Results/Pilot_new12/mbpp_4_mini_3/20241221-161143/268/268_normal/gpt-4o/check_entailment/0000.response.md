To analyze the program provided against the problem description, we need to ensure that the function `func_1` can correctly find the maximum value in the nth column of a matrix represented as a list of lists.

Letâ€™s examine potential edge cases:

1. **Invalid Column Index**: If `n` is out of bounds (i.e., greater than the number of columns available in any of the rows), the code would raise an `IndexError` when accessing `row[n]`.

2. **Empty Matrix**: If an empty matrix is provided, the program would also raise an `IndexError`.

3. **Matrix with Rows of Different Lengths**: If the inner lists (rows) have different lengths, accessing `row[n]` for a missing column would result in an `IndexError`.

Given these points, the function does not account for these edge cases where it could fail or raise exceptions. For instance:

- If we invoke `func_1([], 0)` with an empty matrix, it will throw an error.
- If we invoke `func_1([[1, 2], [3]], 2)`, it will also throw an error due to the second row having fewer columns than required.

Since there are cases where the program does not meet the requirements as described by the problem, we classify the program as incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
