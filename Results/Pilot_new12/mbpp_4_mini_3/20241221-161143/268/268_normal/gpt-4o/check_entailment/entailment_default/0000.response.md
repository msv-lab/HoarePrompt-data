Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The code is indeed intended to return the maximum value of the n-th column of a given matrix. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the input `n` exceeds the number of elements in a row or if `matrix` is empty. For instance, if `func_1([], 0)` is called on an empty matrix or if `func_1([[1, 2, 3]], 3)` is called where `n` is beyond the available indices, the function would raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
