Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` accurately fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n`, returning the maximum value from the `n`-th column of that matrix.

2. **Column Extraction**: The list comprehension `[row[n] for row in matrix]` successfully constructs a new list that contains only the elements of the `n`-th column from each row in the provided matrix. This aligns with the problem requirement of targeting a specific column.

3. **Maximum Calculation**: The function then uses the `max()` function to determine the maximum value from the extracted list of column values. This meets the requirement to return the maximum of the `n`-th column.

4. **Assumptions**: The problem description states that the input will be valid, meaning that each sublist (row) will contain at least `n` elements and `n` is a non-negative integer. The program is designed under these assumptions, which means there's no need to handle potential errors from invalid inputs in this context.

Given these points, the program consistently performs as required and produces the correct output for valid input based on the problem description.
