Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the provided column index `n` exceeds the number of elements in any of the rows of the matrix. This will result in an `IndexError` when trying to extract the non-existent n-th element. For example, if the input matrix is `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `n` is `2`, this will cause an error because the rows only contain two elements (indices 0 and 1), and there is no index 2. Additionally, the check for an empty matrix is also absent. Hence, the program will not function correctly in all scenarios as outlined in the problem description.
