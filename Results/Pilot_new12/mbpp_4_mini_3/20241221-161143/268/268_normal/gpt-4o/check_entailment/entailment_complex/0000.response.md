Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the specified criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n`, which specifies the index of the column from which to select the maximum value.
2. **Column Extraction**: The function uses a list comprehension to generate `nth_column`, which contains the n-th elements of each row of the matrix. This aligns with the problem's requirement of obtaining the n-th column from the given matrix.
3. **Maximum Value Calculation**: After obtaining the n-th column, the function employs the `max()` function to find and return the maximum value from `nth_column`, fulfilling the core task of returning the maximum value from the specified column.
4. **Assumptions**: The comments clarify that the input is expected to be valid (i.e., the matrix has at least one row, and all rows contain at least n elements). Given the assumption of valid input, the program will not encounter errors or exceptions like `IndexError` in normal operations.
5. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions demonstrate that the function has been tested with multiple valid input cases, confirming that it produces the correct maximum for the specified column.

Therefore, the program adheres strictly to the problem description and successfully implements the required functionality.
