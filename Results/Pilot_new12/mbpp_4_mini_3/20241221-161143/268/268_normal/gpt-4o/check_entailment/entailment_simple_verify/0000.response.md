The original assessment correctly identifies multiple edge cases where the program could fail, such as handling invalid column indices, empty matrices, and matrices with rows of different lengths. However, based on the annotated version, we are instructed to assume that the input will always be valid. Under this assumption, the function will always operate on a well-formed matrix and a valid column index.

The annotated code states that the program is called with assumptions which guarantee that:
- The input matrix is a list of lists.
- Each sublist (representing a row) contains at least `n` elements.
- `n` is a non-negative integer and respects the condition `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`.

Given these conditions, the function `func_1` accurately retrieves the `n-th` column values and correctly computes the maximum from it.

Therefore, under the provided assumptions regarding valid input, the program functions correctly and meets the problem description without raising any errors.

Final: **True**
