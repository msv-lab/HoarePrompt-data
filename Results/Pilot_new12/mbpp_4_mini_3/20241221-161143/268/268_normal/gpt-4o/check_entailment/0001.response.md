Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the specified column index `n` is out of bounds. For example, if the input matrix is `[[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5]]` and `n` is `3`, the program will raise an `IndexError` because there is no fourth column in the matrix. 

Additionally, if the matrix is empty (i.e., `[]`) and any value for `n` is provided, the code will also raise an error since there are no rows to access. Thus, the implementation fails for these potential edge cases.
