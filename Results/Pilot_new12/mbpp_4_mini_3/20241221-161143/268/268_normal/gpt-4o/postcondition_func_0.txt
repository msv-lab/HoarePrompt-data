The function accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a list of lists representing a two-dimensional array, and a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. It extracts the n-th column from the matrix, which comprises the n-th elements from each row of the matrix. The function then returns the maximum value from this n-th column. Notably, the function assumes that the input `matrix` has at least one row and that all rows contain at least n elements; however, it does not handle cases where the input may be invalid, such as if `n` exceeds the number of elements in a row or if `matrix` is empty. In such cases, the function may raise an `IndexError`.
