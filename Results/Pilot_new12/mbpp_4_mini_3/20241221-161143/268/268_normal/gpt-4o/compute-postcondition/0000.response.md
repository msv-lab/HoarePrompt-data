The variable `nth_column` is assigned a list comprehension that extracts the `n`th element from each row of the `matrix`. Here, `n` is a non-negative integer with the condition `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`, meaning that it is a valid index for the elements within the rows of `matrix`. 

The state of `nth_column` will now contain the elements at index `n` from each sublist (row) of `matrix`. The output depends on the specific lists in `matrix` and the value of `n`, but we know that `nth_column` will be a list with length equal to `len(matrix)`.

Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`matrix` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a row of the matrix and contains at least n elements; `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]); `nth_column` is a list containing the n-th elements from each row of `matrix`.**
