#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists where each inner list contains numerical values, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column across all rows in the matrix, where n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a list of lists where each inner list contains numerical values, and a non-negative integer `n`, such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`. It returns the maximum value from the (n-1)th column across all rows in the matrix. If `n` is 0, the function will raise an `IndexError` since the (n-1)th column would be -1, which is an invalid index. The function does not handle empty matrices or check whether all rows are of equal length, which could lead to further errors if the assumptions about the structure of `matrix` are not met.
