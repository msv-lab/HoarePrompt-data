The original assessment highlighted several key issues with the function, including its handling of improper inputs and potential indexing errors. However, the annotated code specifies valid input conditions, stating that the matrix contains numerical values and that `n` is a non-negative integer satisfying `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`.

Given the annotation, we can conclude that under the specified conditions, the program will always correctly return the maximum value from the specified `n`-th column of the matrix, as it's guaranteed that the input will not lead to indexing errors or exceptions.

1. The key conditions provided in the annotation ensure that `n` will always access a valid column index. 
2. The assumption of valid input means that cases like an empty matrix or varying row lengths do not need to be considered, which were the main points of concern in the original assessment.

Therefore, based on the annotations and the fact that the input is guaranteed to be valid, we can conclude that the program behaves correctly according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
