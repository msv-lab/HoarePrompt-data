Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle every potential case as described in the output hints. Specifically:

1. If `n` is 0, the function will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the (-1) index of the rows in the matrix. This is a case that the program does not correctly handle.
2. The program does not check for empty matrices, which can also lead to errors if the input matrix is empty.
3. The function assumes that all rows of the matrix have the same length without performing any checks, which could lead to errors if a row has fewer columns than expected. 

These issues illustrate that the function is not robust against various edge cases outlined in the hints. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.
