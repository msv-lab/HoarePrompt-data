To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided information, let's analyze each component:

1. **Problem Description**: The function is required to return the maximum value from the n-th column of a matrix represented as a list of lists.

2. **Program**: The implementation of the function `func_1(matrix, n)` correctly attempts to access the (n-1)-th column of the matrix using a generator expression and returns the maximum of its values.

3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment highlighted potential issues regarding column index out-of-range errors when `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns. This implies the program does not check if the input `n` is within a valid range.

4. **Annotated Code**: The annotations provide clarification that `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`. This indicates an assumption that the input will always be valid and will not cause any index-related errors, as outlined in the assumptions provided.

5. **FinalEvaluation**: Given the annotations specify that `n` will adhere to valid constraints and the original assessment infers that it does not handle edge cases regarding invalid `n` values, it seems necessary to reconsider the validity of those assertions.

Since the annotated code explicitly states that it will not encounter out-of-range issues due to the constraints on `n`, the implementation is deemed correct under the assumptions provided.

Thus, both the problem description and the annotated version support that the implementation is correct, assuming valid input is always provided.

Final: **True**
