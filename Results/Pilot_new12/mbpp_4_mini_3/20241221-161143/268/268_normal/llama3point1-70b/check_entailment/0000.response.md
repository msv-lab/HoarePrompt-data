To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code.

Problem description: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.

Program:
```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

1. The function takes two arguments: `matrix`, which is a list of lists (representing the rows of a matrix), and `n`, which is the column index (1-based).
2. The function generates a generator expression that accesses the `(n - 1)`th element of each row in the matrix and computes the maximum value.

Let's consider the following potential issues:
- **Column Index Out of Range**: If `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in any row of the matrix, this will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `row[n - 1]`. The function does not handle these out-of-range indices.
  
For example:
- If the input is `matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `n = 3`, it would attempt to access `row[2]`, which does not exist, leading to an error.
- If the input is an empty matrix `matrix = []` and `n = 1`, it will also lead to an error since there are no rows to access.
- If `n = 0` or `n < 0`, it will also throw an error.

Since the program does not account for these cases, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
