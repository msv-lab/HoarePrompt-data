Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description correctly. According to the problem description, the function must return the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix, where 'n' is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`. However, in the program, the code attempts to access the (n-1)th column (i.e., `row[n - 1]`), which means the function will return the maximum value from the (n-1)th column instead of the nth column.

Moreover, if `n` is 0, the formula `row[n - 1]` will lead to an attempt to access the index `-1`, which is invalid and will raise an `IndexError`. This is contrary to the stated behavior in the problem description, which does not specify that the input can be 0 or how to handle it.

Thus, the implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem description, as it incorrectly refers to a different column than specified and does not handle the situation when `n` is 0 appropriately. This leads to potential errors or unexpected results in obtaining the maximum value from the intended column.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not implement the specified functionality as required.
