To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the code implementation.

**Problem Description**: 
The task is to write a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) and returns the maximum value from the `n`-th column of that matrix.

**Program Analysis**: 
The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

- The function takes two arguments, `matrix` and `n`.
- It extracts the `n`-th column using a generator expression `(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)` and calculates the maximum of the values in that column via the `max()` function.

**Considerations**:
1. **Indexing**: The code accesses `row[n - 1]`, which implies that `n` is expected to be 1-based (this typically aligns with common expectations). However, if `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in any row of the matrix, it would raise an `IndexError`.
  
2. **Empty Matrix**: If the matrix is empty (i.e., `matrix = []`), the program will raise a `ValueError` since `max()` requires at least one argument.

3. **Inconsistent Row Lengths**: If the rows of the matrix do not have the same number of columns (i.e., some rows are shorter than others), attempting to access an index that may not exist will also lead to an `IndexError`.

4. **Valid Input Handling**: There is no handling for cases where `n` might not correspond to a valid column index in the matrix.

Given these considerations, we can outline specific test cases where the program may fail:

- Case 1: An empty matrix: `func_1([], 1)` will raise a `ValueError`.
- Case 2: A matrix with varying row lengths: `func_1([[1, 2], [3]], 2)` will raise an `IndexError` since the second row does not have a second column.
- Case 3: When `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in any row.

Thus, there are several scenarios where the program does not handle inputs correctly according to the problem description.

Given the analysis, the program does not satisfy the correctness requirement for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
