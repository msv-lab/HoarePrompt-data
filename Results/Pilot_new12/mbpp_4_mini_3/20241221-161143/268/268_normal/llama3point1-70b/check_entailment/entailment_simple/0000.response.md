Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The requirement is to return the maximum value from the nth column of the matrix. However, in the code, the function is trying to access the (n-1)th column instead of the nth column. This means that for an input column `n`, it is attempting to find the maximum value from the column that is one index before the specified `n`, which yields incorrect results. 

For instance, if the function is called with `n = 1`, it should return the maximum of the first column (index 0), but instead, it is accessing index `0` (the second column) and looking for the maximum from there, leading to a misunderstanding of the problem specification. 

The correct implementation should directly use `n` instead of `n - 1` when accessing the list. Since the program does not fulfill the requirements described, it is deemed incorrect.
