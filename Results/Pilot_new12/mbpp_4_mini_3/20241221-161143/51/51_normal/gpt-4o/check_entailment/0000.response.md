The provided program's goal is to multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the product by the length of the list. 

However, the program does have a potential edge case that it does not handle correctly: 

1. **Empty List**: The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty (i.e., `numbers = ()`). In this case, the length of the list would be zero, leading to a division by zero error when trying to execute `result = product / len(numbers)`.

Hence, since the program fails to handle at least one case correctly—namely, the empty list scenario—we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
