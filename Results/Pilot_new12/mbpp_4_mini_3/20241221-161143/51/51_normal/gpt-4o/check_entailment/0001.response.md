To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's break down what the function is supposed to do.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- Write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and divides the product by the length of the list.

**Program Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1` takes a list or tuple of numbers called `numbers`.
2. It initializes `product` to 1.
3. It iterates through each number in the `numbers`, multiplying them together to get the cumulative `product`.
4. After calculating the product, it divides this product by the length of the `numbers` list.
5. Finally, it returns the result.

**Testing Cases in the Program:**
- For the input `(8, 2, 3, -1, 7)`, the product is `8 * 2 * 3 * -1 * 7 = -336`. Dividing by the length (5), it results in `-336 / 5 = -67.2`, which is correct.
- For the input `(-10, -20, -30)`, the product is `-10 * -20 * -30 = -6000`. Dividing by the length (3), it results in `-6000 / 3 = -2000`, which is also correct.
- For the input `(19, 15, 18)`, the product is `19 * 15 * 18 = 5130`. Dividing by the length (3), it results in `5130 / 3 = 1710`, which is correct as well.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. An empty list: If `numbers` is empty, dividing by the length results in a division by zero error. However, the program does not gracefully handle empty input, which would cause it to throw an error.
2. If `numbers` contains one element (e.g., `[5]`), the product would be `5`, and dividing by the length `1` is valid. But for an empty list, it will fail.
3. If all numbers are `0`, the product is `0`, and dividing by the length will yield `0`, which would be valid.

Since the program does not handle the scenario of an empty input list, it is not correct in dealing with all cases as specified in the problem. 

Correctness: **False**
