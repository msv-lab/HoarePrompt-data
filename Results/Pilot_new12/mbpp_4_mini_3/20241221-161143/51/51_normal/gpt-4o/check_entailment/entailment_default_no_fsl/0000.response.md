Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle cases where the input list may contain zeros. Specifically, if the list contains a zero, the product of all numbers will be zero. Dividing this zero product by the length of the list results in zero, which may not be a meaningful output depending on the context in which the function is used. 

For example, calling `func_1([0, 1, 2])` would yield a result of `0.0`, which could be misleading since the presence of zero in the list nullifies the contribution of other non-zero numbers. This indicates that the function does not meet the problem description's intent adequately in all scenarios.

Additionally, the presence of negative numbers is also not articulated well in the programâ€™s output or in the problem's description. While the function does return a negative result correctly for negative inputs, it doesn't clarify the implications of returning a negative value in combination with specific inputs. 

Therefore, due to these reasons, the function does not fulfill the requirements for every potential case, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
