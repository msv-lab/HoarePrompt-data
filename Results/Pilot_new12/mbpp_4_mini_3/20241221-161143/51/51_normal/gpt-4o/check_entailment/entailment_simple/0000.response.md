Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of numbers (in this case, a tuple is being used in the assertions which behaves like a list for iteration purposes) and compute the product of all numbers.

2. **Multiplication of All Numbers**: The for loop correctly iterates over each number in the input list (or tuple) and multiplies them together, storing the cumulative product in the `product` variable.

3. **Division by Length**: After calculating the product, the program divides this product by the length of the input list. This is done using the expression `product / len(numbers)`.

4. **Return Expected Result**: Finally, the function returns the calculated result, which is the product of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers (length of the list).

5. **Correct Handling of Inputs**: The function assumes valid input as stated in the prompt, meaning it doesn't handle empty lists or non-numeric inputs. However, since itâ€™s stated that valid inputs will always be given, it fulfills the requirements set forth in the problem description.

The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases. 

Overall, the program accomplishes exactly what is required in the problem statement, thus it is correct.
