Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identified that the program does not handle the case of an empty list, which would result in a division by zero error. Although the annotated version assumes the input will be valid and non-empty, the problem description does not explicitly guarantee non-empty input. Therefore, regardless of the provided annotations and assuming valid inputs, the program lacks robustness for this scenario, resulting in it being incorrect in handling all potential cases.

In conclusion, since handling an empty list is a crucial aspect of the function's reliability, the program's failure to do so means it does not strictly meet the requirements laid out in the problem description. Hence, the final assessment of correctness remains **False**.
