The code provided performs the required operations as described in the problem statement, which is to multiply all numbers in the list and divide the product by the length of the list. However, upon examining the function and its behavior based on the provided output hints, it becomes clear that there are potential shortcomings.

### Explanation:
1. **Zero Handling**: If the input list contains any zero(es), the product will be zero, leading to a result of `0.0`. For example, an input of `(0, 5, 3)` would yield `0.0`, which may not be meaningful. There's no condition to handle or indicate that such a case would lead to a product of zero.

2. **Negative Numbers**: While the function does have the potential to handle negative numbers correctly by returning a negative product, there is no mention in the problem description regarding how those should be treated in a meaningful statistical context.

3. **Misleading Result**: If the list has both positive and negative values that multiply to a negative product, the output doesn't incorporate context regarding the nature of what is being calculated.

While all the assertions given pass correctly, the output hints reflect the limitations in terms of handling special cases such as zeros, which can mislead the outcome's interpretation.

Thus, since the function does not address every potential case outlined in the problem description or implied by the output hints, the code is ultimately considered incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
