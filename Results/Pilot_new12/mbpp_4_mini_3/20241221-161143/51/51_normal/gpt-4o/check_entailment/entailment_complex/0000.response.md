Correctness: **True**

The provided program satisfies the problem description, which requires a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the product by the length of the list. 

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of how the function `func_1` achieves this:

1. **Parameter Expectations**: The function is designed to take a non-empty list of numbers (either integers or floats). The annotations confirm that `numbers` will not be empty when the function is executed, aligning with the problem's expectations.

2. **Calculating the Product**: The `for` loop iterates over each number in the list, multiplying them together. By initializing `product` to 1 (the multiplicative identity), the function correctly computes the cumulative product of all numbers in the input list.

3. **Dividing by Length**: After calculating the product of all numbers, the next step divides this product by the length of the list. This operation is consistent with the problem description, which requires the final result to be the product divided by the number of elements in the list.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed result, which directly aligns with the required output of multiplying the numbers and dividing by the list's length.

5. **Testing with Assertions**: The assertions provided confirm that the function works correctly across various input scenarios, including both positive and negative numbers. 

Though the function does not explicitly handle cases with zero in the list (which could lead to a product of zero), the problem description does not specify constraints against including zeros or utilizing negative numbers. Therefore, under the assumptions of valid input, the function meets the requirements laid out in the problem statement.

Consequently, the function behaves as required for valid input scenarios. Thus, it is correct as per the problem description.
