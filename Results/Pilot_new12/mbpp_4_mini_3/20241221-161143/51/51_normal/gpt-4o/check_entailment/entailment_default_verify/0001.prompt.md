You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's break down what the function is supposed to do.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- Write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and divides the product by the length of the list.

**Program Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1` takes a list or tuple of numbers called `numbers`.
2. It initializes `product` to 1.
3. It iterates through each number in the `numbers`, multiplying them together to get the cumulative `product`.
4. After calculating the product, it divides this product by the length of the `numbers` list.
5. Finally, it returns the result.

**Testing Cases in the Program:**
- For the input `(8, 2, 3, -1, 7)`, the product is `8 * 2 * 3 * -1 * 7 = -336`. Dividing by the length (5), it results in `-336 / 5 = -67.2`, which is correct.
- For the input `(-10, -20, -30)`, the product is `-10 * -20 * -30 = -6000`. Dividing by the length (3), it results in `-6000 / 3 = -2000`, which is also correct.
- For the input `(19, 15, 18)`, the product is `19 * 15 * 18 = 5130`. Dividing by the length (3), it results in `5130 / 3 = 1710`, which is correct as well.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. An empty list: If `numbers` is empty, dividing by the length results in a division by zero error. However, the program does not gracefully handle empty input, which would cause it to throw an error.
2. If `numbers` contains one element (e.g., `[5]`), the product would be `5`, and dividing by the length `1` is valid. But for an empty list, it will fail.
3. If all numbers are `0`, the product is `0`, and dividing by the length will yield `0`, which would be valid.

Since the program does not handle the scenario of an empty input list, it is not correct in dealing with all cases as specified in the problem. 

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a non-empty list of integers or floats. It calculates the product of all the numbers in the list and then divides that product by the length of the list to compute the result. The function ultimately returns this result. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the list may contain zeros, which could lead to a product of zero. This could mitigate the meaningfulness of the division, especially for cases where all input numbers are zero. Additionally, if the input list contains negative numbers, the product returned would reflect that negativity in the result, which might not be clear from the annotations provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
