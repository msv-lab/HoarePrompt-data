Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because although the function `func_1` works correctly for valid input and correctly implements the logic of multiplying the numbers and dividing by the length, it does not handle the case of an empty list, and it could mislead regarding inputs that are all zeros. The output hints affirm that the function is expected to handle non-empty lists and that all input numbers should be meaningful, but they point out that an assumption has been made regarding the validity of input. Given that the function lacks checks for conditions like an empty list or all-zero inputs, it does not meet the robustness typically expected of such functions, thus confirming the correctness evaluation as **False**.
