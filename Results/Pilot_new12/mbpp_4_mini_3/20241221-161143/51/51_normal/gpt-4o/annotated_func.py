#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats) and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is equal to the product of all numbers in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is the last number in the list.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the result which is equal to the product of all numbers in the list 'numbers' divided by the length of the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a non-empty list of integers or floats. It calculates the product of all the numbers in the list and then divides that product by the length of the list to compute the result. The function ultimately returns this result. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the list may contain zeros, which could lead to a product of zero. This could mitigate the meaningfulness of the division, especially for cases where all input numbers are zero. Additionally, if the input list contains negative numbers, the product returned would reflect that negativity in the result, which might not be clear from the annotations provided.
