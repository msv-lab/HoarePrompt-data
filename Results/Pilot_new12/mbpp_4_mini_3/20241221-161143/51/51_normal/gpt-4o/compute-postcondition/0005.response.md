According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. The loop continues as long as there are more numbers in the list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the second number in `numbers`, and `numbers` has at least 2 numbers. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least 3 numbers, so the loop can move to the third number in the list. Thus, `num` would need to be updated to the third number in the list.

State: **`product` is equal to the first number in `numbers` multiplied by the second number in the list, `numbers` is a list of at least 3 numbers, `num` is the third number in the list**
