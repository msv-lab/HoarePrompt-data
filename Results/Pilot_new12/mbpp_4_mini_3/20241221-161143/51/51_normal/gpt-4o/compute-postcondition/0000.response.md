The variable `product` is initialized with the value of 1. This does not change the value of the list `numbers` or any other variables, and simply establishes `product` as starting at 1. Therefore, the Output State remains with the unchanged condition of the list of numbers and updates `product`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats) and the list is not empty; `product` is 1.**
