The variable `product` is multiplied by `num`. Since `product` is equal to the first number in `numbers`, and `num` is set to the second number in the list, the new value of `product` will be the result of multiplying the first and second numbers in `numbers`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`product` is equal to the first number in `numbers` multiplied by the second number in the list; `numbers` is a list of at least 2 numbers; `num` is the second number in `numbers`.**
