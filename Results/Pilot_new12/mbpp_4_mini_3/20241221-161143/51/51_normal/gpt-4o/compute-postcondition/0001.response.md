According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Given that the list is not empty, the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `num` needs to be initialized to the first value from the `numbers` list. Since `product` is 1, it does not impact the ability of the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `num` must be the first number in the `numbers` list.

State: **`product` is 1, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is set to the first number in the list**
