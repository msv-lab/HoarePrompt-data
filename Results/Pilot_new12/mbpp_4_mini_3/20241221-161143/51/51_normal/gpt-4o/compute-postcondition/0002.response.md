The value of `product` is multiplied by `num`. Given that `product` is initially 1 and `num` is set to the first number in the `numbers` list, the new value of `product` will be equal to that first number. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `product` is equal to the first number in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is set to the first number in the list.

Output State: **`product` is equal to the first number in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is set to the first number in the list.**
