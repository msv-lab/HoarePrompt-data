The variable `result` is assigned the value of `product` divided by the length of `numbers`. Given that `product` is equal to the product of all numbers in the list `numbers` and `numbers` is a non-empty list, `len(numbers)` will return a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, we can specify that `result` is equal to `product / len(numbers)`.

Output State: **`product` is equal to the product of all numbers in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is the last number in the list, `result` is equal to `product / len(numbers)`**.
