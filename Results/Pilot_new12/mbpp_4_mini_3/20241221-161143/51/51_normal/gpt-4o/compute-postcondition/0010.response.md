The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats), and the list is guaranteed to be not empty. After executing the function body, it calculates the product of all numbers in the list and divides that product by the length of the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty list of numbers and return the product of those numbers divided by the count of the numbers in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers (a non-empty list of integers or floats) and returns the product of all numbers in the list divided by the length of the list.**
