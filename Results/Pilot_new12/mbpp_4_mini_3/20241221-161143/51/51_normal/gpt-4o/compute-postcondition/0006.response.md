The value of `product` is updated to be the current value of `product` multiplied by `num`. Since `product` is initially equal to the product of the first and the second numbers in `numbers`, and `num` is the third number in the list, the new value of `product` will be the product of the first, second, and third numbers in `numbers`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`product` is equal to the product of the first, second, and third numbers in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of at least 3 numbers, `num` is the third number in the list**.
