Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a non-empty list of integers or floats. It calculates the product of all the numbers in the list and then divides that product by the length of the list to compute the result. The function ultimately returns this result. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the list may contain zeros, which could lead to a product of zero. This could mitigate the meaningfulness of the division, especially for cases where all input numbers are zero. Additionally, if the input list contains negative numbers, the product returned would reflect that negativity in the result, which might not be clear from the annotations provided.**
