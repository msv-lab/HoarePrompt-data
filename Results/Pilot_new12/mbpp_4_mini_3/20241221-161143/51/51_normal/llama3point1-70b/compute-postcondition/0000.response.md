The variable `product` is assigned the value `1`. Since the initial state has a list of numbers that is not empty, other variables are not affected by this assignment of `product`. The output state now includes the value of `product`, which has been initialized to `1`. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats) and the list is not empty; `product` is 1**
