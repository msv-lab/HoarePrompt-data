According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since the list is not empty, at least one iteration of the loop will occur. The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in `numbers` during the first iteration. The variable `product` starts at 1, which does not affect the loop execution itself but may be relevant for calculations inside the loop.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `num` needs to be assigned the first number from the `numbers` list, and we need to confirm that `numbers` is not empty.

State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is the first number in the list, and `product` is 1**
