`product` is assigned the value of `product` multiplied by `num`. The initial value of `product` is 1 and `num` is the first number in the list, which is not empty. Therefore, the value of `product` after the operation becomes equal to `num` (since 1 multiplied by any number is that number). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is the first number in the list, `product` is equal to `num`.**
