The code `product *= num` means that `product` will be updated to be equal to its current value multiplied by `num`. Since `product` is initially equal to `num`, the new value of `product` will be `num * num`, or `num^2`.

Now, let's address the variables. The initial state specified that `numbers` is a list with at least two elements, `num` is the second number in that list, and `product` is equal to `num` initially. After executing the code, `product` will now be the square of `num`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second number in the list, `product` is equal to `num^2`.**
