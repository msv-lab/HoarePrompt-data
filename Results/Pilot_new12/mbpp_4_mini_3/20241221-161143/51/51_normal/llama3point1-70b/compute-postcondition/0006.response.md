`product` is multiplied by `num`. Since `product` is initially equal to `num^2`, after the operation, `product` becomes `num^2 * num`, which simplifies to `num^3`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third number in the list, and `product` is equal to `num^3`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third number in the list, `product` is equal to `num^3`.**
