The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) and the list is guaranteed to be non-empty. The function calculates the product of all the numbers in the list. It then returns the value of this product divided by the length of the list `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty list of numbers and return the product of the numbers divided by the count of those numbers in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers and returns the product of the numbers divided by the count of those numbers in the list.**
