Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly highlighted the potential issues with the program, particularly regarding edge cases. However, the annotated version clarifies that we are assuming the input will always be valid and will not cause errors, such as division by zero or non-numeric values. Given this context, the program behaves correctly according to the problem description when provided with a non-empty list of numbers, as it successfully computes the product and divides it by the length of the list. Therefore, upon reassessment with the annotations taken into account, the conclusion is that the program meets the expected requirements without encountering any specified errors.
