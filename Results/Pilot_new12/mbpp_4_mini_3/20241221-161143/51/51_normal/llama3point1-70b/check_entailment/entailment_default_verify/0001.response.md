The original assessment identified key issues related to the program's correctness, particularly concerning edge cases such as empty lists and the potential for a division by zero error. The assessment accurately captures that the program does not handle these scenarios and fails to validate input robustness, potentially leading to runtime errors.

However, the output hints clarify that the function is expected to deal with a non-empty list of numerical values, thus implying that the assumption is that the program will not encounter cases that would lead to such errors. This indicates a specification of the input that the program is intended to handle correctly without errors. 

Given the output hints and the specific context that the function is designed to work with non-empty numerical lists, the original assessment can be viewed as overly cautious about edge cases that are meant not to occur according to the problem description and hints.

Therefore, aligning with the provided information, we note that while the original assessment highlighted valid concerns, those concerns may not apply in the context specified:

Final: **True**
