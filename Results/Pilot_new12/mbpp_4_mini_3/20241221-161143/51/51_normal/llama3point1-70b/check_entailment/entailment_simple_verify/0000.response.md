Based on the analysis of the provided program, the problem description, and the annotations, we can reevaluate the program's correctness. 

The original assessment found that the program does not handle the edge case of an empty list, which leads to a division by zero error. However, the annotated version specifies that it is assumed that the input will always be a non-empty list of numbers. Therefore, in the context of the annotations, the concern about the empty list is not applicable.

Furthermore, the program correctly initializes `product` to 1, iterates over the list to compute the product of the numbers, and successfully divides the result by the length of the list. These steps align with the problem description stating that we need to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide by the length of that list.

Given that the annotation clarifies that `numbers` is always a list with at least one element, we conclude that the program operates correctly under these assumptions and fulfills the problem requirements without raising any errors.

Thus, after reviewing the evidence from the annotations and confirming that they support the correctness of the program under the presumption of valid input, we align with the existing requirement that the function correctly implements the desired behavior.

Final: **True**
