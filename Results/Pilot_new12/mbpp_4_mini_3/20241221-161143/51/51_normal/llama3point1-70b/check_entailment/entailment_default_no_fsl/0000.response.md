Correctness: **False**

The code does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, while the function correctly multiplies all numbers in the list and divides by the length of the list, it does not appropriately handle the case where the list contains zeros. If the list contains a zero, the product will be zero, and thus the final output will also be zero regardless of the other numbers. This does not align with the expectation that the function computes the average of the product per element when zeros are included.

For example, if we have the input `[1, 2, 0, 4]`, the program will return `0.0`, which misrepresents the average product per element since the product of non-zero elements should be considered.

Thus, the code is incorrect since it fails to account for cases involving zeros in the input list.
