You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem Description:**
The task requires writing a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides the product by the length of the list.

**Program Implementation:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

**Analysis:**
1. **Calculation of Product:** The variable `product` is initialized to 1 and is multiplied by each number in the list, which is correct approach for calculating the product of numbers.
   
2. **Division by Length:** After calculating the product, the program divides it by the length of the list (`len(numbers)`). This part seems technically correct based on the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Empty List:** If the input list `numbers` is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0. This will cause a division by zero error, which is not handled in the program. This is a significant edge case that causes the program to fail, as it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
   - **Input Validation:** The program does not check if `numbers` contains any non-numeric values. If the list contains a non-numeric value, the multiplication will raise a `TypeError`.

Since there are cases where the program does not work as expected, especially when provided with an empty list, the result is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats) and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is equal to the product of all numbers in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that has at least one element, `num` is the last number in the list.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the value of product divided by the length of the list 'numbers', where product is the product of all numbers in the list and len(numbers) is the number of elements in 'numbers'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
