To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we first break down the requirements:

**Problem Description:** Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.

**Program Provided:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of Product:** The product is initialized to 1, which is correct for multiplication.
2. **Loop Through Numbers:** The function multiplies all the numbers in the input list `numbers`.
3. **Division by Length:** After computing the product of the numbers, the function divides by the length of the list.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List:** If the input list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0, which will lead to a division by zero error.
- **Negative Numbers:** The function does not specify how to handle negative numbers. While it should still produce a valid numerical result, it does not conform to a specific expectation without more context.
- **Input as Zero:** If the list contains a zero, the product will be zero, resulting in zero being returned regardless of the length of the list (which is correct mathematically but may not conform to specific use cases depending on interpretations).

### Verdict:
The function has a critical flaw: it does not handle the empty list case, leading to a division by zero error. 

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

**Reason:** The function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when provided with an empty list, which means it does not handle this edge case correctly.
