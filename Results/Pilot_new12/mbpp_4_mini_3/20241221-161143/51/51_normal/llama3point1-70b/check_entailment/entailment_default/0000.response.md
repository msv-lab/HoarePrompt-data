The code provided computes the product of elements in a list and divides it by the number of elements in that list. The problem description states that the input list will be non-empty, eliminating concerns about division by zero.

However, the output hints indicate a significant issue: if the list contains a zero, the product will be zero, and thus the final result will also be zero regardless of how many elements there are. This does not align with a reasonable interpretation of multiplying numbers and dividing by their count, since the average should consider the actual product rather than zeroing out the result.

For example:
- If the input list is `[2, 3, 0]`, the expected behavior (without the zero) might suggest combining the product and length meaningfully would lead to some non-zero outcome. But the actual output would be `0 / 3 = 0`, which misrepresents the input values.

Since the code fails to handle the edge case where the list contains zeros, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
