To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem Description:**
The task requires writing a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides the product by the length of the list.

**Program Implementation:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

**Analysis:**
1. **Calculation of Product:** The variable `product` is initialized to 1 and is multiplied by each number in the list, which is correct approach for calculating the product of numbers.
   
2. **Division by Length:** After calculating the product, the program divides it by the length of the list (`len(numbers)`). This part seems technically correct based on the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Empty List:** If the input list `numbers` is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0. This will cause a division by zero error, which is not handled in the program. This is a significant edge case that causes the program to fail, as it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
   - **Input Validation:** The program does not check if `numbers` contains any non-numeric values. If the list contains a non-numeric value, the multiplication will raise a `TypeError`.

Since there are cases where the program does not work as expected, especially when provided with an empty list, the result is:

Correctness: **False**
