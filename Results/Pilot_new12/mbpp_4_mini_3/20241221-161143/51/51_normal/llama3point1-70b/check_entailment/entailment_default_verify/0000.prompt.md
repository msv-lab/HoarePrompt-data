You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we first break down the requirements:

**Problem Description:** Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.

**Program Provided:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of Product:** The product is initialized to 1, which is correct for multiplication.
2. **Loop Through Numbers:** The function multiplies all the numbers in the input list `numbers`.
3. **Division by Length:** After computing the product of the numbers, the function divides by the length of the list.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List:** If the input list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0, which will lead to a division by zero error.
- **Negative Numbers:** The function does not specify how to handle negative numbers. While it should still produce a valid numerical result, it does not conform to a specific expectation without more context.
- **Input as Zero:** If the list contains a zero, the product will be zero, resulting in zero being returned regardless of the length of the list (which is correct mathematically but may not conform to specific use cases depending on interpretations).

### Verdict:
The function has a critical flaw: it does not handle the empty list case, leading to a division by zero error. 

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

**Reason:** The function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when provided with an empty list, which means it does not handle this edge case correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty list of numerical values (integers or floats) and computes the product of all elements in the list. It then returns the result divided by the number of elements in the list. Since the input list is non-empty, the division by the length of the list will not lead to a division by zero error. However, there is no handling for cases where the list contains zeros, which would result in the product being zero. The function finalizes by providing an average product per element, offering insight into the scale of the product relative to the count of elements in the list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
