Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1` accurately implements the requirements of the problem description by calculating the product of the numbers in the list and then dividing by the length of that list. The annotations provided further confirm that the input is expected to be valid, specifically a non-empty list of numbers. Since we assume that the user will always provide valid input, we do not need to consider cases of an empty list or non-numeric values, which were previously highlighted as potential issues. The annotated version supports the reasoning that under the given assumptions, the function operates correctly and fulfills the specified task. Therefore, the function is assessed as correct, leading to the conclusion that the final assessment is **True**.
