Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements of the problem description by performing exactly what is specified: it multiplies all the numbers in the input list and divides the resulting product by the length of the list.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Requirements**: The program is stated to accept a non-empty list of numerical values (integers or floats), fulfilling the requirement in the problem description.

2. **Multiplication Logic**: The `for` loop iterates through each number in the `numbers` list and updates the `product` variable by multiplying each number. This correctly computes the product of all numbers in the list.

3. **Division by Length**: After calculating the product, the program divides this product by the length of the list using `len(numbers)`, which provides the average product per element. This aligns with the problem's request to divide by the length of the list.

4. **Robustness against Zero**: Although the code does not explicitly handle the case where the list contains zeros, according to the problem description, the function is still considered correct since we're operating under the assumption that the input is valid (non-empty list) and the user will provide valid inputs. The division by zero is explicitly avoided by having a non-empty input, which guarantees that `len(numbers)` will always be at least 1.

5. **Return Value**: The final return statement accurately reflects the result required by the problem description.

Altogether, the function efficiently and correctly performs the requested calculations for valid inputs as described.
