The function accepts a non-empty list of numerical values (integers or floats) and computes the product of all elements in the list. It then returns the result divided by the number of elements in the list. Since the input list is non-empty, the division by the length of the list will not lead to a division by zero error. However, there is no handling for cases where the list contains zeros, which would result in the product being zero. The function finalizes by providing an average product per element, offering insight into the scale of the product relative to the count of elements in the list.
