Functionality: ** The function accepts a parameter `input_list`, which is expected to be a list containing elements. It transforms this list into a tuple and returns it. The final state of the program will be that a tuple containing all the elements of `input_list` is returned. There is no handling for cases where `input_list` might not be a list, or is empty, but these conditions do not alter the returned type, which will still be a tuple (it will just be an empty tuple if the list is empty). Thus, if provided with an inappropriate type, it will raise a TypeError at the tuple conversion stage. **
