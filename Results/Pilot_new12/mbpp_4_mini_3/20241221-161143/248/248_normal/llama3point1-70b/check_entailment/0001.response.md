Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description, which asks to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes an input list and returns a tuple containing the elements of that list.

The conversion from list to tuple is handled correctly by the built-in `tuple()` function in Python. Here are the main points confirming the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts any list as input, including an empty list or a list with various data types (integers, floats, strings, etc.).
2. **Output**: The output is guaranteed to be a tuple containing all elements from the input list in the same order.
3. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases like:
   - An empty list (`[]`), which will return an empty tuple `()`.
   - A list with mixed data types (e.g., `[1, 'a', 3.14]`), which will return the tuple `(1, 'a', 3.14)`.

Since I cannot identify any potential case where this program does not perform as the problem description requires, I conclude that the program is correct.
