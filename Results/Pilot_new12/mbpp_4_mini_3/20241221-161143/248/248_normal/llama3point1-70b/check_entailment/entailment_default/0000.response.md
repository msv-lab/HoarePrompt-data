Explanation: The function provided correctly converts a list to a tuple, as stated in the problem description. The output hints align with the behavior of the code, indicating that it accepts a list and returns a tuple containing the same elements. Since there is no indication or requirement in the problem description that suggests handling cases where the input might not be a list or could be empty, and since the program works correctly for valid input (i.e., a list), we can conclude that the program is correct as per the given specifications.

Correctness: **True**.
