Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to convert a list into a tuple. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `input_list`, which is specified to be a list, and then uses the `tuple()` constructor to convert this list into a tuple. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, as it successfully achieves the goal of the conversion. 

Additionally, the program assumes that the input will always be a valid list, and given this assumption, it will handle any valid list input correctly and return the corresponding tuple. There are no logical flaws or unhandled edge cases specified in the problem statement that would affect the correctness of the program. Therefore, the program correctly fulfills the requirement of converting a list to a tuple.
