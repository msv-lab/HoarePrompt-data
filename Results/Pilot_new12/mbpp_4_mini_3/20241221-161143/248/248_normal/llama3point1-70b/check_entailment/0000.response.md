Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function, which is designed to take an iterable (like a list) and convert it into a tuple. It will function correctly for all potential cases, including:

- An empty list (`[]`) which will yield an empty tuple (`()`).
- A list containing various types of elements (e.g., integers, strings, etc.), and the function will return a tuple containing those elements in the same order.

Since there are no potential edge cases where this function would fail to convert a list to a tuple as specified in the problem description, the correctness of the code is confirmed.
