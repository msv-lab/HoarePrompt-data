Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to convert a list to a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor. The annotations support the correctness by highlighting that the input `input_list` is indeed a list and that the return value is a tuple created from its elements. The program meets the problem description, and there are no edge cases that would cause it to fail under the assumptions of valid input. Therefore, the assessment of correctness remains unchanged.
