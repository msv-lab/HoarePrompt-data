Correctness: **False**

The program correctly converts a list to a tuple as specified in the problem description. However, the output hints note that the function does not handle cases where `input_list` may not be a list. If a non-list type is passed to the function (e.g., a string or an integer), a TypeError will be raised when trying to convert that input to a tuple. Therefore, while the program functions correctly for valid input (i.e., when `input_list` is actually a list), it fails to address invalid inputs according to the expectation of handling potential edge cases. Since it does not work correctly for all potential cases, it is considered incorrect.
