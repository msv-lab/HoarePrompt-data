You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a list to a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list):
    return tuple(input_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description, which asks to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes an input list and returns a tuple containing the elements of that list.

The conversion from list to tuple is handled correctly by the built-in `tuple()` function in Python. Here are the main points confirming the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts any list as input, including an empty list or a list with various data types (integers, floats, strings, etc.).
2. **Output**: The output is guaranteed to be a tuple containing all elements from the input list in the same order.
3. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases like:
   - An empty list (`[]`), which will return an empty tuple `()`.
   - A list with mixed data types (e.g., `[1, 'a', 3.14]`), which will return the tuple `(1, 'a', 3.14)`.

Since I cannot identify any potential case where this program does not perform as the problem description requires, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list of elements.
def func_1(input_list):
    return tuple(input_list)
    #The program returns a tuple containing the elements of the list 'input_list'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
