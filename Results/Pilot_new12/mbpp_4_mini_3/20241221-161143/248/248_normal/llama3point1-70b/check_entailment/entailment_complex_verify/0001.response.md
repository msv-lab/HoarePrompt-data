Final: **True**

The program successfully meets the problem description, which states that it should convert a list to a tuple. The original assessment is accurate as it highlights the following key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to accept a list as input, which is corroborated by the annotated version indicating that `input_list` is expected to be a list. Given the assumption that inputs to the program will always be valid (a list), there are no issues in this regard.

2. **Output**: The program correctly returns a tuple containing all elements of the input list in the same order. This behavior is confirmed by the annotation stating that it transforms the list into a tuple.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases effectively, such as converting an empty list to an empty tuple without errors, as described in the annotations.

The annotations clarify that the function does not include explicit error handling for invalid inputs or empty lists, but given the assumption of valid input, this does not affect the correctness. Therefore, the original assessment stands correct, and the function performs as intended according to the problem description.
