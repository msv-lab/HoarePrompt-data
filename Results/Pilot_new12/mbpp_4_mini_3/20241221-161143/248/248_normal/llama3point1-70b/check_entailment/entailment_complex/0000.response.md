Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to convert a list to a tuple. Here's why it meets the described functionality:

1. **Input Assurance**: The annotated program clearly specifies that `input_list` is expected to be a list of elements. We assume valid input is provided as per the problem description.
  
2. **Conversion Process**: The function `func_1` receives the list as an argument and immediately returns a tuple created from that list using the `tuple()` constructor. This conversion is both straightforward and effective for the purpose of transforming the list's elements into a tuple.

3. **Return Type**: Regardless of whether the input list is empty or full, the function correctly returns a tuple. An empty list would simply yield an empty tuple, which is still a valid output according to the problem's requirements.

4. **Lack of Error Handling**: While there is no explicit type checking or error handling included, the problem description states that we assume valid input. Therefore, we do not view the lack of error handling as a flaw, provided the input is guaranteed to be valid.

In conclusion, the program adheres to the task at hand by converting a list to a tuple as required, complying with the problem description and assumptions made about the input.
