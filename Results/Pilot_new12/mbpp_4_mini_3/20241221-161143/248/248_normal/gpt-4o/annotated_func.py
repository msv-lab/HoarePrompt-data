#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list containing elements of any type.
def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)
    #The program returns a tuple containing all elements of the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function 'func_1' accepts a single parameter 'lst', which is expected to be a list containing elements of any type. It converts the list into a tuple and returns this tuple. The resulting tuple will include all elements from the list in the same order. There are no checks for empty lists or specific element types; thus, if 'lst' is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The function does not handle any errors that may occur from invalid input types (non-list types), as it directly uses the input in the tuple conversion. Overall, the function simply transforms a list into a tuple representation, with the final output being a tuple of the list's contents.
