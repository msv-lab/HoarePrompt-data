Final: **True**

The program correctly converts a list to a tuple, as stipulated in the problem description. The function `func_1` utilizes the built-in `tuple()` function to achieve this transformation and the provided assertions confirm its correctness for various list input scenarios.

The annotated code indicates that before the function call, the `lst` variable is indeed a list containing elements of any type, aligning well with the assumption that valid input will always be given. The state right before the function call as described supports that `func_1` will return a tuple consisting of all elements from the list. 

Since the function satisfies the conditions set out in the problem statement and all assertions are validated by the code's behavior, the original assessment of correctness remains justified. Thus, the program is indeed correct.
