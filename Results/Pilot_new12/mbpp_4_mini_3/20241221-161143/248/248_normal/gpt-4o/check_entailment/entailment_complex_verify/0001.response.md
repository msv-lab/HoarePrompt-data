Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the conversion of a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement. The program uses Python's built-in `tuple()` function, which is designed for this purpose, ensuring that all elements of the input list are preserved in the resulting tuple. 

The provided assertions effectively test the function with various inputs, all of which yield the expected results, thereby demonstrating the function's correctness. The annotations further clarify that the function is intended to handle any valid list input and explicitly return an empty tuple for an empty list, without failing under normal conditions. Since the problem description and the behavior described in the annotations align with the assertions and the original assessment, the conclusion that the function is correct holds true.
