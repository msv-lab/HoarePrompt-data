Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list `lst` as input and converts it to a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor. This accurately fulfills the problem description, which requires the function to convert a list into a tuple. 

The assertions provided in the code validate that the function works as intended for different valid input cases:
- The first assertion checks if the list `[5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]` is converted to the tuple `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`.
- The second assertion verifies that the list `[2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]` is converted to the tuple `(2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`.
- The third assertion ensures that the list `[58, 44, 56]` is converted to the tuple `(58, 44, 56)`.

Since the function successfully converts any list input into the expected tuple format according to the described requirements, it meets the problem description's criteria without any issues.
