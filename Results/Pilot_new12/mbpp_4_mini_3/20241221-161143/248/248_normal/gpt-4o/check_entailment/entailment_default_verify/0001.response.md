Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(lst)` correctly meets the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. The output hints reinforce this conclusion, stating that the function takes a list (which is assumed valid) and uses Python's `tuple()` to convert it into a tuple without altering the order of elements. The assertions provided in the program confirm that for each example input list, the output is the expected tuple, ensuring the function behaves correctly in these scenarios.

Moreover, while the hints note that there are no checks for empty lists or specific element types, the prompt assumes valid input will always be provided. As such, these aspects do not detract from the function's correctness in terms of converting a list into a tuple as specified in the problem description.
