Correctness: **True**

The program successfully converts a list to a tuple as per the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter, `lst`, which is expected to be a list. It correctly uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert this list into a tuple, maintaining the order of elements. 

The example assertions provided demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input lists, including lists with integers and varying lengths, including the case of an empty list, which will return an empty tuple. 

Since the assumptions include that users will always provide valid input, edge cases like handling non-list types or empty lists do not affect the correctness according to the given conditions. Thus, the implementation meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential valid case of input.
