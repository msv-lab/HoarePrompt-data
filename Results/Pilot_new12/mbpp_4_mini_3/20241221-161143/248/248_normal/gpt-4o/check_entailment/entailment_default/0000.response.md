Explanation: The provided function `func_1` successfully converts a list into a tuple. The output hints correctly describe the functionality of the code, stating that it accepts a list and returns a tuple containing the same elements in the same order. Since there are no constraints or edge cases mentioned regarding the input (such as handling empty lists or specific element types), and since the problem assumes valid input, the function behaves correctly for every potential case under these assumptions. Additionally, the provided assertions in the program verify the correctness with typical inputs. 

Correctness: **True**.
