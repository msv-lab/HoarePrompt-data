Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the requirement of converting a list to a tuple as stated in the problem description. The assertions provided confirm that the function produces the expected output for various valid input lists. Additionally, the annotated version of the code supports this assessment by clearly stating that the function returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list. Since there are no indications of failure or edge cases that could affect the expected behavior of the function, it is determined to be correct.
