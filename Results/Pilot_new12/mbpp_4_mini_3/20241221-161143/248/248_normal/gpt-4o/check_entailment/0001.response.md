Correctness: **True** 

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly converts a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement. It uses Python's built-in `tuple()` function, which is specifically designed for this purpose. 

The provided assertions test the function with several input cases, and all assert conditions are appropriate and expected results of converting lists to tuples. Since no edge cases or examples where the function fails to work as intended can be identified, the implementation is confirmed to be correct for any list input.
