Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct as it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and converts it into a tuple, which is precisely what the problem description asks for.

1. **Functionality**: The function takes one argument (`lst`), which is expected to be a list. It correctly converts this list into a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor. 

2. **Output**: The function returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list in the same order. The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function behaves correctly for various test cases, returning the expected tuple outputs.

3. **No Error Handling Needed**: While the function does not include checks for empty lists or invalid input types (as noted in the annotations), the assumption is made that valid input will always be provided. Therefore, under these assumptions, the function operates as intended.

The program successfully fulfills the requirement of converting a list to a tuple for all potential valid input scenarios specified in the problem description. Thus, it correctly implements the functionality requested.
