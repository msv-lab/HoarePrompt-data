The function `func_1` accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple that contains the pairwise bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from each input tuple. If the input tuples are of different lengths, it will only process pairs of elements available in both tuples, ignoring any additional elements in the longer tuple. This means that the resulting tuple will have the length of the shorter tuple, which is a potential edge case to be aware of.
