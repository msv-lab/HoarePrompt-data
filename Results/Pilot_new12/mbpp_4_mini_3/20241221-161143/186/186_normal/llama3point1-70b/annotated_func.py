#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the pairwise bitwise AND of the elements of tup1 and tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple that contains the pairwise bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from each input tuple. If the input tuples are of different lengths, it will only process pairs of elements available in both tuples, ignoring any additional elements in the longer tuple. This means that the resulting tuple will have the length of the shorter tuple, which is a potential edge case to be aware of.
