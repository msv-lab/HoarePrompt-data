The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple where each element is the result of the pairwise bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and return a tuple containing the pairwise bitwise AND of their elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples tup1 and tup2 and returns a tuple containing the pairwise bitwise AND of their elements.**
