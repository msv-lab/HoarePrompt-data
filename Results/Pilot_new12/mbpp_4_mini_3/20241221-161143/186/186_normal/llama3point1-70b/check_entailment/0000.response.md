To evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether it correctly extracts element-wise values from two tuples using bitwise AND operation and returns a new tuple of those results.

Let's inspect the program:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Input Types**: The function expects two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`). There are no checks for the types of the inputs.
  
2. **Element-wise Operation**: The use of `zip(tup1, tup2)` pairs the elements of both tuples, which is the correct approach for performing element-wise operations.

3. **Bitwise AND**: The operation `(x & y)` is valid for integers and can lead to incorrect behavior if other types (e.g., strings) are passed in, as they do not support bitwise operations.

4. **Return Value**: The program returns a new tuple containing the results of the bitwise AND operation, which is aligned with the problem description.

### Potential Cases:

- **Matching Lengths**: If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, the program will still work correctly because `zip` will pair elements until the shorter tuple is exhausted.
  
- **Non-integer Elements**: If any of the elements in either tuple are non-integers (e.g., strings, floats), the operation will raise a `TypeError`. For instance, calling `func_1((1, 2), ('a', 'b'))` will result in an error, demonstrating incorrect behavior per the problem's requirements.
  
### Conclusion:

The program does not handle cases where elements of the tuples might not support the bitwise AND operation, which is a critical aspect of its correctness.

Correctness: **False**. 

An example where this fails is: `func_1((1, 2), ('a', 'b'))`, which will raise a `TypeError`. This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential inputs as defined in the problem description.
