Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the problem description requirement accurately. The task is to "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." However, the function implements a pairwise bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. 

The problem description suggests that we need to extract elements from the two tuples as tuples, possibly indicating a need to return the tuples unchanged or in a different manner. Instead, the program performs a bitwise operation, which is not a simple extraction of elements.

A correct implementation would simply return the tuples as they are or concatenate the elements in some manner, depending on the intended interpretation of "extracting." Since the program does not adhere to the specified functionality in the problem description, it is incorrect.
