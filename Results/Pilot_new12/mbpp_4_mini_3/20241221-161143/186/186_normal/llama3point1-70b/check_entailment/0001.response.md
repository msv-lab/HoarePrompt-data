To assess the correctness of the provided program, we first need to interpret the problem description accurately. The task is to extract element-wise tuples from the two given tuples. 

Looking at the program, the function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` is defined to return a tuple where each element is the result of performing the bitwise AND operation (`&`) between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. 

Let's evaluate the function with various inputs to see if it behaves as expected according to a reasonable interpretation of "extracting elementwise tuples":

1. **Input with integers:**
   ```python
   func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))  # Expected output: (0, 0, 2)
   ```
   - (1 & 4) = 0
   - (2 & 5) = 0
   - (3 & 6) = 2
   
   The output is indeed (0, 0, 2).

2. **Input with booleans:**
   ```python
   func_1((True, False, True), (False, True, True))  # Expected output: (False, False, True)
   ```
   - (True & False) = False
   - (False & True) = False
   - (True & True) = True
   
   The output is (False, False, True).

3. **Input with mixed types:**
   ```python
   func_1((1, 2.5), (3, 4.5))  # Expected output: TypeError or similar because & is not defined for float.
   ```
   - Attempting to perform a bitwise AND operation on a float leads to a TypeError, illustrating that the function does not handle mixed types or floats properly.

4. **Unequal length input tuples:**
   ```python
   func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))  # Expected output: (3, 0) or LengthError or similar, as behavior is undefined.
   ```
   - The function will stop processing once the shortest tuple is exhausted, resulting in (1 & 3, 2 & 4), which produces (1, 0).

Given these cases, we see that the program does not handle the following cases correctly:
- It will throw an error when trying to perform a bitwise operation on floats or mixed data types.
- In the case of unequal length tuples, it does not explicitly manage or warn about the differing lengths.

Thus, considering that the function fails in these scenarios, the correctness of the program can be stated as:

Correctness: **False** 

The function does not cover all potential cases as described (i.e., it should handle cases with floats and mixed types properly, and also handle tuples of different lengths gracefully).
