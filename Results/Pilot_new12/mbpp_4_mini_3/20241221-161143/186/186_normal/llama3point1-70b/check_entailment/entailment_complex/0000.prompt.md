You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the pairwise bitwise AND of the elements of tup1 and tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple that contains the pairwise bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from each input tuple. If the input tuples are of different lengths, it will only process pairs of elements available in both tuples, ignoring any additional elements in the longer tuple. This means that the resulting tuple will have the length of the shorter tuple, which is a potential edge case to be aware of.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
