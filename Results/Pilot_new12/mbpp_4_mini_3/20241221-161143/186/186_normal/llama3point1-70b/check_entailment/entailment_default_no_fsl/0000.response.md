Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and produces a new tuple containing the bitwise AND of each corresponding pair of elements. The use of `zip` ensures that only pairs from the shorter tuple are processed, effectively ignoring any excess elements from the longer tuple. 

The program behaves correctly as per the problem description:
- It processes the elements pairwise correctly.
- It accounts for tuples of different lengths by limiting the output to the length of the shorter tuple.

Since the code effectively handles the described scenarios and edge cases, I conclude that it is correct.
