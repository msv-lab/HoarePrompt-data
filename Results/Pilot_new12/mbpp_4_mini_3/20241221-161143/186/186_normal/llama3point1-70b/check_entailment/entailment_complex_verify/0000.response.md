The task is to evaluate the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description while considering the annotations given for various states of the program.

### Given Information:

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to write a function that extracts element-wise operations from two tuples.
  
2. **Program Provided**: 
   ```python
   def func_1(tup1, tup2):
       return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
   ```

3. **Original Assessment**: The program was assessed as incorrect primarily because it does not handle cases where elements are non-integers, which would lead to a `TypeError`. It correctly identifies that using `zip` allows for element-wise operations but fails when different types are present.

4. **Annotated Code**: The program's annotation states that it correctly performs element-wise bitwise AND operations and works properly for tuples of differing lengths, processing only pairs from the shorter tuple. 

### Evaluation:

- The annotated version confirms that `func_1` takes tuples, processes them correctly using bitwise AND, and handles tuples of different lengths accurately by using `zip`. 

- The argument that the original assessment stated that the program is "incorrect" due to potential `TypeError` arising with non-integer types is valid from a theoretical standpoint, but the annotations suggest that we assume valid inputs will always be provided. 

### Final Assessment:

Since we are operating under the assumption that the input will always be valid as per the updated instructions, the program behaves as specified in the problem description. It will correctly handle two tuples of appropriate types (like integers), thus fulfilling the requirement.

Ultimately, while the original assessment identified failure cases correctly based on a broader interpretation (i.e., non-integer inputs), the annotations and the context allow us to conclude that provided valid inputs are followed, the program operates correctly.

Therefore, sticking to this reasoning:

Final: **True**
