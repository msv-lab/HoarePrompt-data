Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." The term "extract" implies that the function should return the elements themselves or a specific form of them, rather than performing a bitwise operation.

The function `func_1` performs a pairwise bitwise AND operation on the elements of the two tuples, which is not what is asked in the problem description. There is no indication that bitwise AND should be performed; the correct operation should have been explicitly outlined in the problem description.

Thus, while the function appears to work correctly in terms of executing pairwise operations on the provided tuples, it fundamentally does not align with the problem description regarding what "extract" means in this context. The output of the function therefore does not correspond to the expected outcome based on the instructions given.
