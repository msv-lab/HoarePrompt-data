The problem description clearly states that the function's goal is to extract the elementwise AND from two given tuples, and the output hints confirm that the function is intended to perform a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples.

Reviewing the assertions in relation to the function's behavior:

1. The first assertion is correct, as the outputs match the expected result from the bitwise AND operations.
2. The second assertion also returns the expected result correctly.
3. The third assertion, however, shows a mismatch since the expected output `(0, 9, 10, 0)` does not align with the actual outputs derived from the operations on the tuples, leading to an incorrect result.

The output hints further reinforce that the function only processes elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, thus potentially leading to discrepancies in the expected results if the tuples are of different lengths. However, the primary evaluation still hinges on whether the function consistently produces the expected outputs as per the assertions.

The original assessment correctly concluded that the third assertion fails, indicating that the program does not meet the problem description satisfactorily for all cases. 

Given this analysis, I maintain the original assessment that the program is indeed incorrect due to failing the third assertion. 

Final: **False**
