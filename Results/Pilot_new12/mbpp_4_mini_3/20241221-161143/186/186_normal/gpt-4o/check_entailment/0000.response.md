To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's break down the provided information.

**Problem description:** Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)

def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

### Evaluation of the code:

1. The function `func_1` takes two tuples as input.
2. It uses `zip` to combine the two tuples element-wise and employs a generator expression to apply the bitwise AND operation (`&`) on corresponding elements (`a` from `tuple1` and `b` from `tuple2`).
3. The output is constructed as a new tuple containing these results.

### Analyzing the assertions:

- **Assertion 1:** 
  - Input: `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`
  - Expected output: `(0, 0, 2, 1)`
  - Calculation: 
    - `10 & 5` = `0`
    - `4 & 2` = `0`
    - `6 & 3` = `2`
    - `9 & 3` = `1`
  - Result: `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which matches the expected output.

- **Assertion 2:** 
  - Input: `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`
  - Expected output: `(1, 2, 3, 0)`
  - Calculation:
    - `1 & 5` = `1`
    - `2 & 6` = `2`
    - `3 & 7` = `3`
    - `4 & 8` = `0`
  - Result: `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, matches the expected output.

- **Assertion 3:**
  - Input: `(8, 9, 11, 12)` and `(7, 13, 14, 17)`
  - Expected output: `(0, 9, 10, 0)`
  - Calculation:
    - `8 & 7` = `0`
    - `9 & 13` = `9`
    - `11 & 14` = `10`
    - `12 & 17` = `0`
  - Result: `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which does not match the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The third assertion fails based on the expected output, indicating an error in the program's implementation. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, which is a requirement for correctness.

Correctness: **False**.
