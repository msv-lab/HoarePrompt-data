The problem description requires a function to extract the elementwise results from two tuples. Specifically, it needs to return the result of an operation applied to the corresponding elements of the two tuples.

The annotated program, `func_1`, performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the provided tuples. This means that for each pair of elements `(a, b)` from `tuple1` and `tuple2`, it computes `a & b`, and we can see from the provided assertions that the expected results are tuples that represent such bitwise AND results.

However, the problem description does not mention the use of a bitwise AND operation. Instead, it merely states to "extract the elementwise and tuples," which is ambiguous and could imply any form of elementwise operation. Since the specification does not clarify why the bitwise AND is specifically chosen, and considering that typically elementwise operations may involve various types of arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, or averaging, the function fails to adhere strictly to the problem statement. 

Therefore, the program could be seen as failing to meet the requirement, as the operation it performs is not explicitly stated nor universally understood from the provided description of "extract the elementwise and tuples."

Thus, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description since it performs a bitwise AND operation, which is not explicitly specified or implied in the problem description provided.
