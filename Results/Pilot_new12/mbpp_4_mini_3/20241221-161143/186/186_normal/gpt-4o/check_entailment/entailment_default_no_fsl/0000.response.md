Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` is intended to compute the element-wise bitwise AND of two tuples. However, there are several issues highlighted in the output hints that suggest the function does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases:

1. **Handling of Tuples of Different Lengths**: If the two input tuples are of different lengths, the function only processes elements up to the length of the shorter tuple and ignores the remaining elements in the longer tuple. This does not reflect the entirety of both input tuples as mentioned in the output hints.

2. **Lack of Error Handling for Non-numeric Inputs**: The function assumes that all elements in the input tuples are numeric or binary values. If non-numeric types (like strings or None) were provided, the function would raise an error, but there is no handling for this scenario.

3. **Examples Showing Incorrectness**: For example, if we take the tuples `(10, 4)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the function would only compute the AND for the first two elements, resulting in `(0, 0)` while ignoring the additional values, which could lead to misleading results as per the expected behavior.

Due to these issues, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for every potential case.
