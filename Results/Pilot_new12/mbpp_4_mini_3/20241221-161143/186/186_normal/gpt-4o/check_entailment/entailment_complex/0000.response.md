Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem states that the function must "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." However, the implementation of the function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation between the elements of the two tuples.

The expected functionality based on the problem description implies that the function should combine or concatenate the tuples in some form, rather than applying a bitwise operation. The use of the bitwise AND operator `&` does not align with the requirement of "extracting" tuples elementwise.

Additionally, the examples in the assertions imply an output that does not hold with a simple tuple extraction or combination as one would expect. For example, for the inputs `((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, the output `(0, 0, 2, 1)` does not make sense in the context of an elementwise tuple extraction.

Thus, the implementation does not fulfill the requirement as described in the problem statement, leading to its classification as incorrect.
