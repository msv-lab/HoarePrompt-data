To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let’s examine the function `func_1` and the assertions that follow. 

The function's task appears to be extracting elementwise values from the two input tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2` using a bitwise AND operation, given the way it employs `(a & b)` in a generator expression.

Let’s analyze the assertions to see if they are aligned with the expected functionality:

1. **For the first assertion:** `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`
   - `10 & 5` results in `0`
   - `4 & 2` results in `0`
   - `6 & 3` results in `2`
   - `9 & 3` results in `1`
   - This correctly returns `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.

2. **For the second assertion:** `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`
   - `1 & 5` results in `1`
   - `2 & 6` results in `2`
   - `3 & 7` results in `3`
   - `4 & 8` results in `0`
   - This correctly returns `(1, 2, 3, 0)`.

3. **For the third assertion:** `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`
   - `8 & 7` results in `0`
   - `9 & 13` results in `9`
   - `11 & 14` results in `10`
   - `12 & 17` results in `12`
   - However, the assertion expects `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which is incorrect based on the bitwise operations performed.

This last case indicates that the program does not correctly calculate the expected outcome according to the description.

Conclusion: Since the program fails the test case for the provided third assertion due to incorrect expected results, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
