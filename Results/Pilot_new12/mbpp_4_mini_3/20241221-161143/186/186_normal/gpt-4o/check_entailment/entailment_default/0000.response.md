The problem description states that the function should extract element-wise values from two given tuples. The program is designed to perform a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of these tuples.

In the provided assertions, the function `func_1` takes two tuples and returns a tuple that contains the result of the bitwise AND operation for elements at the same positions in both tuples. The function uses `zip` to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.

Output hints indicate that the function operates on the shorter length of the two tuples, which means that if the input tuples are of different lengths, the function will not account for any extra elements in the longer tuple. This is a critical aspect because the problem description does not mention any limitations regarding the lengths of the input tuplesâ€”implying that it should ideally handle both tuples fully, regardless of their length.

Test case `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)` yields a result of `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is correct based on the bitwise AND operation:
- 10 & 5 = 0
- 4 & 2 = 0
- 6 & 3 = 2
- 9 & 3 = 1

However, if we test with tuples of different lengths, for example `(10, 20)` and `(5, 2, 3)`, the result is only for the first two elements, leading to a tuple of `(0, 0)` without taking into account the third element from the second tuple at all.

This indicates that the program does not handle cases where tuples are of different lengths as expected, as it only processes until the shorter tuple ends, while the problem did not specify that only the shorter tuple should be considered.

Therefore, because the function does not meet the implied requirement of handling tuples of any length and may produce incomplete results, we should conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
