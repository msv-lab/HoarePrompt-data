#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, both of which are tuples containing numeric or binary values. It returns a new tuple that contains the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. If the input tuples are of different lengths, the function will only process elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, potentially leading to output that does not reflect the entirety of both input tuples. No additional error handling for non-numeric input types is provided.
