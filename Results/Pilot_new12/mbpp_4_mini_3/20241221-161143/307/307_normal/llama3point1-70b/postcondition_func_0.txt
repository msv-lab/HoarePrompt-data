The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the desired number of digits in a triangular number. It computes triangular numbers iteratively, starting from the first triangular number, until it finds the first triangular number that has at least `n` digits. The function returns the index `idx` of that triangular number. The final state of the program is that `idx` holds the smallest integer such that the corresponding triangular number contains at least `n` digits. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 (as `n` is assumed to be a positive integer) and could potentially run indefinitely if `n` is set incorrectly. The specific indices returned could vary, but the relation between the index and the digit requirement is maintained throughout the iterations.
