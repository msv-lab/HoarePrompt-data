#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is k (where k is the smallest integer such that the number of digits in the triangular number is at least `n`), `triangular_num` is k * (k + 1) / 2, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the desired number of digits in a triangular number. It computes triangular numbers iteratively, starting from the first triangular number, until it finds the first triangular number that has at least `n` digits. The function returns the index `idx` of that triangular number. The final state of the program is that `idx` holds the smallest integer such that the corresponding triangular number contains at least `n` digits. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 (as `n` is assumed to be a positive integer) and could potentially run indefinitely if `n` is set incorrectly. The specific indices returned could vary, but the relation between the index and the digit requirement is maintained throughout the iterations.
