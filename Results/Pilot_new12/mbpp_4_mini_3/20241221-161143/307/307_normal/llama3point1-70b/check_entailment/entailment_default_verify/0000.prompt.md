You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. It starts with the first triangular number and increments the index until it finds a triangular number that meets the digit length requirement. 

For example:
- If `n` is 1, the smallest triangular number is 1 (at index 1).
- If `n` is 2, the smallest triangular number is 10 (at index Triangular number corresponding to index 14).
- If `n` is 3, the smallest triangular number is 100 (at index Triangular number corresponding to index 45).

The function appropriately handles all positive integer values of `n` as input. Since it returns the first index where the number of digits in the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`, it fulfills the problem's requirements for all cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the desired number of digits in a triangular number. It computes triangular numbers iteratively, starting from the first triangular number, until it finds the first triangular number that has at least `n` digits. The function returns the index `idx` of that triangular number. The final state of the program is that `idx` holds the smallest integer such that the corresponding triangular number contains at least `n` digits. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 (as `n` is assumed to be a positive integer) and could potentially run indefinitely if `n` is set incorrectly. The specific indices returned could vary, but the relation between the index and the digit requirement is maintained throughout the iterations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
