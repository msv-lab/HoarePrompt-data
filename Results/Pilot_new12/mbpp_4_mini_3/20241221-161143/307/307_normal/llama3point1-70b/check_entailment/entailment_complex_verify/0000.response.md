Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. The annotated version supports the correctness as it clearly states the behavior of the program at each step, confirming that it iteratively computes triangular numbers and checks their digit lengths properly.

The annotations explain that the function starts with `idx` initialized to 1 and continues to compute triangular numbers until it finds one whose length in string representation meets the digit requirement of at least `n`. Upon finding such a triangular number, it returns the current index. This aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements.

Furthermore, the assumption of valid input as a positive integer ensures that the function will terminate and give correct results for legitimate cases. The function's handling of input and the clarity of the exit conditions are consistent with the expectations outlined in the problem description. 

Therefore, the function's correctness as described in the original assessment remains intact.
