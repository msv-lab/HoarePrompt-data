The program is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number that contains at least `n` digits. A triangular number for the index `idx` is calculated using the formula: `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.

The output hints indicate that the function computes triangular numbers starting from the first one and will return the index `idx` where the corresponding triangular number has at least `n` digits. The function, however, is stated to not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 and could potentially run indefinitely for invalid inputs.

However, because it is assumed that the input will be valid according to the problem description, and considering the iterative approach of the function to find triangular numbers has been correctly implemented based on the output hints, there are no identified edge cases where the code would fail, as long as `n` is a positive integer.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly calculates triangular numbers and returns the appropriate index for the smallest one that meets the digit requirement. It works for all expected valid inputs and fulfills the problem description without any logical flaws observed in the given hints or functionality.
