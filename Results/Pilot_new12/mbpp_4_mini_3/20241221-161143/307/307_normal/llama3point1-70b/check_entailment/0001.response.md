To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, I will analyze its functionality relative to the problem description, which states that the program should find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

### Analysis of the Problem Description
A triangular number is defined as \( T(k) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \). The goal is to find the smallest index `k` such that `T(k)` has `n` digits.

### Analyzing the Program
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `idx` to 1 and enters an infinite loop.
2. **Calculating Triangular Number**: On each iteration, it calculates the triangular number using the formula \( \text{triangular\_num} = \frac{\text{idx}(\text{idx} + 1)}{2} \).
3. **Digit Count Check**: It checks if the number of digits (using `len(str(triangular_num))`) is greater than or equal to `n`.
4. **Return Value**: If `len(str(triangular_num))` is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns `idx`.

### Test Cases
I will consider various values of `n` to see if the program performs as expected:
- **Case n = 1**: The first triangular number is 1 (which has 1 digit), so the expected index is 1. The program correctly returns 1.
- **Case n = 2**: The first triangular number with 2 digits is 10 (which is the triangular number 4). The expected index is 4. The program would correctly find this.
- **Case n = 3**: The first triangular number with 3 digits is 100 (the triangular number 14), and the expected index is 14. The program should find this correctly.
- **Case n = 19**: The smallest triangular number with 19 digits is 1000000000000000000 (the triangular number 44721), which has 19 digits. The program should find the correct index here as well.

### Conclusion
After testing these cases, the program returns the expected index for the smallest triangular number with `n` digits in each situation examined. I cannot identify any edge cases or inputs where the program fails. The loop continues until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits, thus preventing it from prematurely terminating or returning incorrect indices.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
