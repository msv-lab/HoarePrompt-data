You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, I will analyze its functionality relative to the problem description, which states that the program should find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

### Analysis of the Problem Description
A triangular number is defined as \( T(k) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \). The goal is to find the smallest index `k` such that `T(k)` has `n` digits.

### Analyzing the Program
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `idx` to 1 and enters an infinite loop.
2. **Calculating Triangular Number**: On each iteration, it calculates the triangular number using the formula \( \text{triangular\_num} = \frac{\text{idx}(\text{idx} + 1)}{2} \).
3. **Digit Count Check**: It checks if the number of digits (using `len(str(triangular_num))`) is greater than or equal to `n`.
4. **Return Value**: If `len(str(triangular_num))` is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns `idx`.

### Test Cases
I will consider various values of `n` to see if the program performs as expected:
- **Case n = 1**: The first triangular number is 1 (which has 1 digit), so the expected index is 1. The program correctly returns 1.
- **Case n = 2**: The first triangular number with 2 digits is 10 (which is the triangular number 4). The expected index is 4. The program would correctly find this.
- **Case n = 3**: The first triangular number with 3 digits is 100 (the triangular number 14), and the expected index is 14. The program should find this correctly.
- **Case n = 19**: The smallest triangular number with 19 digits is 1000000000000000000 (the triangular number 44721), which has 19 digits. The program should find the correct index here as well.

### Conclusion
After testing these cases, the program returns the expected index for the smallest triangular number with `n` digits in each situation examined. I cannot identify any edge cases or inputs where the program fails. The loop continues until it finds a triangular number with at least `n` digits, thus preventing it from prematurely terminating or returning incorrect indices.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is k (where k is the smallest integer such that the number of digits in the triangular number is at least `n`), `triangular_num` is k * (k + 1) / 2, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the desired number of digits in a triangular number. It computes triangular numbers iteratively, starting from the first triangular number, until it finds the first triangular number that has at least `n` digits. The function returns the index `idx` of that triangular number. The final state of the program is that `idx` holds the smallest integer such that the corresponding triangular number contains at least `n` digits. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 (as `n` is assumed to be a positive integer) and could potentially run indefinitely if `n` is set incorrectly. The specific indices returned could vary, but the relation between the index and the digit requirement is maintained throughout the iterations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
