Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. While it does correctly compute triangular numbers and return an index where this condition is met for values of `n` greater than or equal to 1, the output hints mention a critical limitation: the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1, as it assumes `n` is strictly a positive integer. 

In scenarios where an invalid value (like zero or a negative number) is provided, the program could enter an infinite loop without ever meeting the return condition since the length of any triangular number will never be greater than or equal to a non-positive integer.

Thus, while the function works correctly for valid positive integer inputs, it fails to handle all potential cases as stipulated in the problem description, leading to an incorrect output for invalid inputs.
