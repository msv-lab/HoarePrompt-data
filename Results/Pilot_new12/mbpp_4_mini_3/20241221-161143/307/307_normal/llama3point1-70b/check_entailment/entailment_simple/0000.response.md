Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the requirement of finding the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. Here's an explanation of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Assumption**: The function takes a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of digits in the desired triangular number. As specified, it is assumed that the input will always be valid.

2. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The triangular number for any index `idx` is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. This calculation is done within a loop that continues indefinitely until the condition (having at least `n` digits) is satisfied.

3. **Length Comparison**: The function converts the triangular number to a string and checks its length to see if it is greater than or equal to `n`. This is the correct way to determine the number of digits in the triangular number.

4. **Return Condition**: When the condition is met, the function returns the index `idx`. Since the loop starts at `idx = 1` and increments until it finds the appropriate index, it guarantees that the returned index is indeed the smallest one.

5. **Infinite Loop Handling**: The program will eventually find a triangular number with at least `n` digits because triangular numbers grow quadratically, meaning that they will eventually reach any number of digits as `idx` increases.

Given all of the above points, the function adheres to the specification of the problem description. It effectively finds the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits and handles the input correctly based on the assumptions made. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified as **True**.
