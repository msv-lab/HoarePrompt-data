Final: **False**

Reason: The program does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1, as indicated by the output hints. This could lead to an infinite loop if `n` were set incorrectly. Even though the code works correctly for positive integers greater than zero, it fails to make provisions for ensuring `n` meets the expected valid input conditions, thereby risking incorrect behavior under those circumstances. The original assessment did not account for this potential flaw and assumed perfect input, which is not fully aligned with the problem description's intent. Hence, the assessment of correctness should be modified to reflect this oversight.
