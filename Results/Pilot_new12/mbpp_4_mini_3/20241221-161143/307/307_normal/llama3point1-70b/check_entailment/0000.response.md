Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. It starts with the first triangular number and increments the index until it finds a triangular number that meets the digit length requirement. 

For example:
- If `n` is 1, the smallest triangular number is 1 (at index 1).
- If `n` is 2, the smallest triangular number is 10 (at index Triangular number corresponding to index 14).
- If `n` is 3, the smallest triangular number is 100 (at index Triangular number corresponding to index 45).

The function appropriately handles all positive integer values of `n` as input. Since it returns the first index where the number of digits in the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`, it fulfills the problem's requirements for all cases.
