Based on the annotations provided along with the original assessment, the program has been evaluated appropriately against the problem description. 

The function computes triangular numbers in a loop and checks whether the number of digits in the triangular number meets or exceeds the specified number of digits `n`. The annotated version clarifies the behavior of the program at various states; particularly, it specifies that the loop continues until the first index with a triangular number having at least `n` digits is found, which aligns perfectly with the goal stated in the problem description.

Every important element of the program's functionality is supported by the annotations:
- The initialization of `idx` to 1 is correctly documented.
- The calculation of triangular numbers using the formula is accurate.
- The logic that checks for sufficient digits in the triangular number, along with the conditions for returning the correct index, all align with the expectations based on the problem description.

The expectations set forth in the original assessment have been satisfactorily met. The input conditions (that `n` will always be a positive integer) are also mentioned, implying that the function does not need to handle any edge cases outside of the specified problem description.

Consequently, no new perspective has altered the understanding of the program's correctness, and I find the original assessment to be correct.

Final: **True**
