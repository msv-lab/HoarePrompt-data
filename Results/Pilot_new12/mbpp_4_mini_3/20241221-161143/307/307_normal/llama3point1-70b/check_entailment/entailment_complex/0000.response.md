Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines the function `func_1(n)`, which is tasked with finding the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct according to the problem description:

1. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The function computes triangular numbers using the formula `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. This formula correctly generates the nth triangular number by following the mathematical definition of triangular numbers.

2. **Digit Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the string representation of the current triangular number is at least `n`. This is done with the condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:`. If this condition is met, it returns the current index `idx`.

3. **Iterative Indexing**: The index is incremented within a loop (`idx += 1`), which ensures that all triangular numbers are checked in ascending order of their index until the condition is satisfied.

4. **Infinite Loop for Positive Input**: The function is designed to run indefinitely until it finds a valid triangular number with at least `n` digits. Since the problem guarantees that `n` is a positive integer, the function will eventually reach a triangular number that satisfies the condition.

While the program does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than one, it is stated in the problem description and the annotations that `n` will always be a positive integer. Hence, it does not need to handle invalid input scenarios as part of the correctness evaluation.

Overall, the program meets the demand of the problem description correctly for all valid positive integer inputs.
