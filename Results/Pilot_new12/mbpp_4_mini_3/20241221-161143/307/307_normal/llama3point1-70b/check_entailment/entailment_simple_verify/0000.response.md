Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly identifies the index of the smallest triangular number that contains at least `n` digits. The provided annotations confirm the correctness of the logic in the function. Specifically, the annotations clarify that before the loop, `n` is a valid input representing the desired number of digits. 

During each iteration of the loop, the program computes the triangular number corresponding to the current index `idx`, and it checks if the number of digits in this triangular number meets or exceeds `n`. Once it finds such a triangular number, it exits the loop and returns the current index `idx`, which is exactly what is required by the problem description. 

Therefore, both the problem analysis and annotated states support the conclusion that the program meets the specifications and behaves correctly under the assumptions made about the input.
