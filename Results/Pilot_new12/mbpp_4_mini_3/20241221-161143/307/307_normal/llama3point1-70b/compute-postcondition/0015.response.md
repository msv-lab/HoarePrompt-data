Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns the value of `idx`, which is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`, the function returns None.***
