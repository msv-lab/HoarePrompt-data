The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` is 2, so the new value of `idx` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`n` and `triangular_num`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 3**.
