The code assigns the value of `triangular_num` to be calculated as `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 3, we can calculate `triangular_num` as follows: 

`triangular_num = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2`  
`triangular_num = 3 * 4 // 2`  
`triangular_num = 12 // 2`  
`triangular_num = 6`  

The other variables, `n` and `idx`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6**
