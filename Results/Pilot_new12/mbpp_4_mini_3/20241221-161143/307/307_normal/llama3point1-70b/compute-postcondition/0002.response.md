`triangular_num` is assigned the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 1, the calculation becomes `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which equals `1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is 1**
