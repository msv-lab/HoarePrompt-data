The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number. After executing the function body, if the criteria for the triangular numbers are met, the function returns the following based on the conditions: 

- Case 1: If the triangular number has at least 'n' digits, the function will return the index `idx`, which is 1.
- Case 2: The function will return the index `idx`, which is 2.
- Case 3: The function will return the index `idx`, which is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the index of the corresponding triangular number based on the number of digits. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer, and returns the index of the triangular number based on the number of digits required. The specific indices returned can be 1, 2, or 3 based on the conditions met.**
