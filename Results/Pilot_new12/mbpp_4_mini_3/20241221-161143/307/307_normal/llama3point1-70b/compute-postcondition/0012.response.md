According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to run indefinitely unless there is a break condition within the loop's body. Since the loop can execute one more time regardless of the state of the variables, there is no need to adjust any states.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 3**
