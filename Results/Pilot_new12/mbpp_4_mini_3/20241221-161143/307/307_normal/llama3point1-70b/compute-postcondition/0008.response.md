The value of `triangular_num` is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. With `idx` being 2, the calculation proceeds as follows: `triangular_num = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `triangular_num = 2 * 3 // 2` = `6 // 2` = `3`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `triangular_num` was previously 1 and is now 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is `"3"`) is still less than `n`, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3. The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is still less than `n`.**
