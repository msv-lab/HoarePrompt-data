The code snippet increments the value of `idx` by 1. In the initial state, `idx` is 3. After executing `idx += 1`, the new value of `idx` will be 4. The values of `n` and `triangular_num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 4, `triangular_num` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 4, `triangular_num` is 6**.
