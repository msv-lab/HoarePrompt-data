According to the code, the `while True` loop is designed to execute indefinitely. Therefore, there are no conditions to evaluate whether the loop will run. The loop will execute as long as the program reaches this point and does not encounter a break or exit. 

Since there are no restrictions or adjustments needed to allow for the first iteration of the loop to proceed, I will simply repeat the program state as is. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 1**
