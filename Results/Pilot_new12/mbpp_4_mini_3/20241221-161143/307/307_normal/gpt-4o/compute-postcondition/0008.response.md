The code calculates the value of `triangular_number` using the formula for the k-th triangular number, which is given by `k * (k + 1) // 2`. From the initial state, `k` is 2, so we can calculate the value of `triangular_number`.

Calculating `triangular_number`:
- `k` is 2
- `triangular_number = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 * 3 // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`

Now, let's summarize the changes. The values of `n`, `k`, and the condition regarding the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` remain unchanged, while `triangular_number` has been updated to 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 2; `triangular_number` is 3; the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
