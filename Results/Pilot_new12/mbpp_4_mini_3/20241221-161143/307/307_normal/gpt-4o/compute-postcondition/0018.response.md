The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, if Case_1 is fulfilled, the function returns the value of `k`, which is 1. If Case_2 is fulfilled, the function returns 2. If Case_3 is fulfilled, the function returns `k`, which is 3. Since only one case can be fulfilled at a time, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return specific integer values based on the conditions defined in each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns 1 if Case_1 is fulfilled, returns 2 if Case_2 is fulfilled, otherwise returns 3 if Case_3 is fulfilled.**
