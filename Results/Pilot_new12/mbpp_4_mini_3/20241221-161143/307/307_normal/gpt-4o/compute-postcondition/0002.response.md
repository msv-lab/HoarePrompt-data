`triangular_number` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is initialized to 1, the calculation of `triangular_number` results in `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which evaluates to `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1; `triangular_number` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1; `triangular_number` is 1**
