According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it can execute indefinitely as it does not depend on any variable condition to terminate it. Thus, it is guaranteed that the loop will proceed to the next iteration without requiring any adjustments to the existing states.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 2; `triangular_number` is 1; the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
