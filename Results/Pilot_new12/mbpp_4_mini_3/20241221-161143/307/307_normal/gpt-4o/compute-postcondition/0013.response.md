The value of `triangular_number` is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given `k` is 3, we have:

- `triangular_number = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2`
- `triangular_number = 3 * 4 // 2`
- `triangular_number = 12 // 2`
- `triangular_number = 6`

The state of the other variables is not affected. Thus, the values now are: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is now 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
