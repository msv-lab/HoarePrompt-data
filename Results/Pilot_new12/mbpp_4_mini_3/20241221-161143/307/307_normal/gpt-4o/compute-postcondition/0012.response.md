According to the code, the loop is a `while True`, which means it will continuously execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement inside the loop. Since the condition is always true, the loop can proceed to the next iteration without any adjustment to the program state.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted to allow for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**.
