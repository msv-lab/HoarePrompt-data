The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `k` is 2, after the increment, `k` becomes 3. The other variables (`n` and `triangular_number`) remain unchanged. The condition regarding the length of the string representation does not impact the output state since the code does not check or modify that condition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
