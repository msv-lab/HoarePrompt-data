#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `k` is the first integer greater than or equal to 1 such that the triangular number corresponding to `k` has exactly `n` digits, `triangular_number` is equal to the triangular number for `k`, and the initial state of `n` is still a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits. It calculates k iteratively, starting from 1, and continues until it finds a triangular number whose length in digits equals `n`. The function effectively searches for a triangular number meeting the length condition but does not include specific checks for edge cases such as when `n` is 1 (which would match the first triangular number) or scenarios where there are no suitable triangular numbers for larger values of `n` within the bounds of typical integer representation. The return postconditions outlined are misleading and do not accurately reflect what the function does; it does not return fixed values of 1, 2, or 3 based on 'Case_1', 'Case_2', or 'Case_3'. Instead, it always returns the found value of `k` when the condition is met, which is the first integer such that the length of the respective triangular number is exactly `n`.
