You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `k` is the first integer greater than or equal to 1 such that the triangular number corresponding to `k` has exactly `n` digits, `triangular_number` is equal to the triangular number for `k`, and the initial state of `n` is still a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits. It calculates k iteratively, starting from 1, and continues until it finds a triangular number whose length in digits equals `n`. The function effectively searches for a triangular number meeting the length condition but does not include specific checks for edge cases such as when `n` is 1 (which would match the first triangular number) or scenarios where there are no suitable triangular numbers for larger values of `n` within the bounds of typical integer representation. The return postconditions outlined are misleading and do not accurately reflect what the function does; it does not return fixed values of 1, 2, or 3 based on 'Case_1', 'Case_2', or 'Case_3'. Instead, it always returns the found value of `k` when the condition is met, which is the first integer such that the length of the respective triangular number is exactly `n`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
