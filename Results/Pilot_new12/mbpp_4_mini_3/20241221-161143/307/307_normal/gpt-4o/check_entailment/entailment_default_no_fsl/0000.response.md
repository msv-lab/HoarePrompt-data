Correctness: **False**

The program aims to find the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits. However, it doesn't correctly handle the edge case when `n` is 1. The first triangular number is `1`, which has 1 digit, and it should return `1` (which represents the first triangular number). Instead, the program would return `k = 1`, which is not correct when looking for the corresponding index for `n = 1`.

Additionally, the output hints point out that the function does not include specific checks for certain edge cases, asserting this issue. The lack of consideration for `n = 1` results in the function providing incorrect results for at least this scenario. Therefore, as the function fails to meet the requirements for every potential case, the correctness is marked as false.
