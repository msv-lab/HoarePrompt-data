To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1` and check if it accurately finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

The triangular number formula is given by `T_k = k * (k + 1) / 2`. The program incrementally calculates triangular numbers starting from `k=1`. It then checks the number of digits in the triangular number using `len(str(triangular_number))` to see if it matches `n`. Once it finds a triangular number with `n` digits, it returns the corresponding index `k`.

Now, let's consider whether the function works correctly for different values of `n`:

1. For `n = 1`: The smallest triangular number with 1 digit is `1` (`T_1 = 1`), and it correctly returns `1`.
2. For `n = 2`: The smallest triangular number with 2 digits is `10` (`T_4 = 10`), and it correctly returns `4`.
3. For `n = 3`: The smallest triangular number with 3 digits is `105` (`T_14 = 105`), and it correctly returns `14`.
4. For `n = 4`: The smallest triangular number with 4 digits is `A  `(`T_45 = 1020`), and it correctly returns `45`.
5. For larger `n`: The function continues to correctly find and return the index for triangular numbers with an increasing number of digits.

However, we can consider edge cases that might not be handled:

- If `n = 0`: The function would enter an infinite loop because there are no triangular numbers with 0 digits. Since all triangular numbers begin with `1` (`T_1 = 1` is already 1 digit), the function would never fulfill the `if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:` condition.
- Similarly, for negative values of `n`, the logic is not designed to handle such input, potentially leading to wrong behavior or an infinite loop.

Thus, `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where `n` is `0` or negative.

Correctness: **False**.

This conclusion is based on the fact that input scenarios like `n = 0` or any negative number will cause the function to behave incorrectly or enter an infinite loop, which violates the problem description's requirement for handling all inputs correctly.
