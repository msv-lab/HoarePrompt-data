Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Objective Understanding**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index `k` of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits. 

2. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The formula for calculating the k-th triangular number is correctly implemented as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is the mathematical definition of a triangular number.

3. **Digit Count Verification**: The program checks the number of digits in the triangular number by converting it to a string and using `len()`. This ensures it counts the digits accurately.

4. **Loop until Condition Met**: The function employs a `while True` loop, which continues to compute triangular numbers until it finds one that has exactly `n` digits.

5. **Return Value**: When it finds a triangular number that meets the digit count requirement, it returns the index `k`. 

6. **Test Cases**: The assertions at the beginning (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, and `assert func_1(4) == 45`) test known values, confirming the accuracy of the function.

Given this analysis, the program fulfills the problem description's requirements by accurately finding the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits.
