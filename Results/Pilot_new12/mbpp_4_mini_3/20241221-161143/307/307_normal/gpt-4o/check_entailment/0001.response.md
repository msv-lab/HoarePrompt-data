To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the code and the requirements laid out by the problem.

The problem description asks for a function that finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined as the sum of the first `k` natural numbers and can be calculated using the formula: 

\[ \text{triangular number} = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \]

The task is to find the smallest `k` such that the triangular number has exactly `n` digits.

Let's review the implementation:

1. The function `func_1` initializes `k` to 1 and enters an infinite loop.
2. In each iteration, it computes the `k`-th triangular number.
3. It converts the triangular number to a string to check its length.
4. If the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`, the function returns `k`.
5. If it does not match, it increments `k` and continues.

### Now, let's consider edge cases and potential problems:

- **For `n = 1`:** The smallest triangular number is 1 (which has 1 digit). The expected output would be `1`, but if we check this, the program might not handle `n = 1` correctly, as it only starts from `k = 1`, and the condition inside the loop will be satisfied immediately and will return the correct index `1`.
  
- **For `n = 2`:** The smallest triangular numbers are: 
    - `1` -> 1 digit
    - `3` -> 1 digit
    - `6` -> 1 digit
    - `10` -> 2 digits (smallest)
  
    The program correctly returns `k = 4` for `n = 2`.

- **For `n = 3`:** The smallest triangular number is `6`, `10`, `15`, `21`, `28`, `36`, `45`, `55`, `66`, and `78` which are 1 and 2-digit triangular numbers, and the next one is `91` which is also 2 digits. We finally get to `n = 3` at `n = 14`.

- **For `n = 4`:** The triangular numbers increase and the first to reach 4 digits is `45`.

Now, let's verify if the program covers all necessary cases and complete ranges of `n`.

After checking these individual cases, and since the program correctly identifies the smallest `k` for `n = 1`, `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`, there doesn't seem to be a situation where the program fails based on the requirements as described.

Thus, we conclude that the function behaves correctly for the demonstrated cases and does not have any apparent shortcomings for varying `n`.

The correctness of the program can be confirmed based on the fact that it correctly identifies the smallest triangular number of `n` digits for the tested values. 

Therefore, my conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
