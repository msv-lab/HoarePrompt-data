The function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits. The assessment correctly breaks down this function’s logic as it initializes `k`, calculates triangular numbers, and checks their lengths until it finds the required condition.

However, the provided output hints imply that the function might not clearly handle edge cases, particularly regarding the smallest triangular number for lower values of `n`, and they suggest a lack of checks for possible out-of-bound scenarios for larger values of `n`. The hint also points out that the descriptions of the return postconditions can be misleading in conveying the function's behavior.

Nonetheless, the original assessment confirms that for the tested values of `n = 1`, `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`, the function correctly returns `k = 1`, `k = 4`, `k = 14`, and `k = 45`, respectively, which aligns with the expectations of triangular numbers.

Despite the potential concerns regarding the handling of edge cases and the output hints indicating that the function might not explicitly communicate certain logical conditions properly, the function still operates correctly within the defined requirements of the given problem.

Thus, retaining the original assessment is justified, as the function’s behavior meets the given requirements based on the analysis of the problem description and the original tests performed.

Final: **True**
