Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description. While the function `func_1` attempts to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, it has a logical flaw regarding the stopping condition.

1. **Validation of Edge Cases**: The function does not correctly handle the case when `n` is 1. The first triangular number (1) has only 1 digit, and the function correctly identifies its index as 1. However, the issue arises because there are multiple triangular numbers that have a single digit (1, 3, 6), but the function needs to find the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits. 

2. **Inefficiency for Larger Values**: For larger values of `n`, the function continues incrementing `k` indefinitely until it finds a triangular number with exactly `n` digits, which would work as intended; however, the constraints are inadequate since if you would increase `n` significantly, the loop would take longer to find an appropriate k.

3. **Incorrect Annotations**: The comments and assertions about specific indices also misrepresent the conditions under which the function operates. The assertions imply that k values returned are guaranteed based on specific n values, which may not be true if `n` were larger than what hypothetical triangular numbers could support.

Due to these reasons, the function does not maintain the integrity of the promises made in the problem description, particularly in terms of handling edge cases and ensuring efficient constraints. Thus, it does not meet the requirements laid out clearly and holds inaccuracies in assumptions about what indices it will return.
