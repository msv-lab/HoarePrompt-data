The provided program aims to find the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits. It does this iteratively by calculating triangular numbers until it finds one that meets the digit-length condition. 

Output hints explain that the function correctly returns the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits, and provides specific cases for `n` values of 2, 3, and 4.

Upon examining the logic, the function returns the appropriate `k` for the specified cases. However, the hints imply that the function does not account for the case when `n` is 1. Based on the problem description, the first triangular number, which is 1 (with 1 digit), does exist. The program will not return an index for `n = 1`, leading to an oversight.

Furthermore, the program hints do mention that the function does not include specific checks for edge cases such as `n = 1`, potentially misleading users into believing the function handles all cases appropriately. 

Thus, since there is at least one case (when `n = 1`) where the program does not return a correct or expected value, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
