Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` with at least one character. It checks if the substring of `s` from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z'. If 'z' is present in that substring, the function returns `True`. If 'z' is not present in the specified substring, or if the substring is empty (which can happen if the length of `s` is less than 3), it returns `False`. Therefore, the function effectively checks for the presence of 'z' in a specific portion of the input string, affecting the returned value based on that check.**
