#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string with at least one character.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True because the substring of 's' from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z' as specified
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string with at least one character, and the substring of `s` from the second character to the second-to-last character does not contain the character 'z'.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` with at least one character. It checks if the substring of `s` from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z'. If 'z' is present in that substring, the function returns `True`. If 'z' is not present in the specified substring, or if the substring is empty (which can happen if the length of `s` is less than 3), it returns `False`. Therefore, the function effectively checks for the presence of 'z' in a specific portion of the input string, affecting the returned value based on that check.
