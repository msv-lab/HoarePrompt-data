The original assessment states that the correctness of the function `func_1` is **False** due to potential `IndexError` exceptions when the string is empty or consists of a single character. However, the annotations indicate that the program is expected to handle valid inputs only (strings with at least one character), which suggests that the user-provided input will not lead to scenarios which could raise the error.

Based on the problem description, the function indeed checks if 'z' appears in the substring delimited by the second character to the second-to-last character. The assertion tests provided are consistent with the expected behavior of the function, showing that it returns `True` or `False` as defined by the problem description. 

The annotations specify that the function's logic is only executed when `s` is a string with at least one character, removing concerns about `IndexError` during normal use cases. Therefore, assuming valid input, the function behaves correctly according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
