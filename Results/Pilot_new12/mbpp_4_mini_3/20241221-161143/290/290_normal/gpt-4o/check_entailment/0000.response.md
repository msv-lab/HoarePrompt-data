Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is intended to check if the string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word. However, there is a critical issue. If the string is empty, or consists of a single character, the function will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access `s[1:-1]`. 

For example:
1. `func_1('')` will cause an `IndexError` because `s[1:-1]` does not exist.
2. `func_1('z')` will also cause an `IndexError` since `s[1:-1]` is out of bounds for a string with only one character.

Thus, the function does not handle all potential cases, specifically empty strings and strings with a single character. Therefore, it is not correct as per the problem description.
