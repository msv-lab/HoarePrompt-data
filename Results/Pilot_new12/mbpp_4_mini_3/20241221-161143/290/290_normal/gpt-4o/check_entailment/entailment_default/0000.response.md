Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check for the presence of 'z' in the string `s` except at the first and last positions. The use of `s[1:-1]` correctly creates a substring that excludes the first and last character of `s`. 

The provided assertions validate the logic:
- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True`, which is correct since 'z' appears in the middle.
- `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False`, also correct as 'z' is at the start.
- `func_1('  lang  .')` returns `False`, which is correct since 'z' is absent.

Based on these checks, the function behaves as intended for the given examples, accurately determining whether 'z' exists in the specified substring of `s`. Since we can conclude that all potential cases covered confirm the program performs correctly according to the specification, the correctness is validated.
