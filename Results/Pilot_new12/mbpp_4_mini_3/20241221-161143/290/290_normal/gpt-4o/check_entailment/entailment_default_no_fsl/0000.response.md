Correctness: **False**

The implementation has a flaw with strings that are less than three characters long. When the input string's length is less than 3, the substring `s[1:-1]` results in an empty string, which will cause the function to falsely return `False`. 

For example:
- The input `'za'` has length 2, so `s[1:-1]` results in an empty substring. Since 'z' is not present in that empty substring, `func_1('za')` would incorrectly return `False`, even though 'z' is present at a valid position. 

Therefore, the function does not correctly handle all potential cases as stated in the problem description.
