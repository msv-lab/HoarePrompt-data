Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` checks for the presence of the character 'z' in a given string `s`, but importantly, it only examines the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character (i.e., `s[1:-1]`). This adheres to the requirement specified in the problem description, which asks for checking if the string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. 

To break down the correctness:

1. **Input Constraints**: It is assumed that the input string has at least one character, which is confirmed by the comment stating that `s` has at least one character.

2. **Check for 'z'**: The condition `('z' in s[1:-1])` accurately checks for the presence of 'z' in the substring that excludes the first and last characters. 

3. **Return Values**:
   - If 'z' is found within the specified substring, it returns `True`, which aligns with the requirement.
   - If 'z' is not found (or if the substring is effectively empty due to `s` being too short), it correctly returns `False`.

The provided assertions in the annotated program further validate the correctness:
- `func_1('pythonzabc.')` correctly returns `True` because 'z' is indeed present in the relevant substring.
- `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` since 'z' is at the start of the string, thus meeting the requirement of excluding it from the check.
- `func_1('  lang  .')` returns `False`, as there is no 'z' in the relevant substring.

All conditions of the problem description are respected, making the program correct throughout its potential input scenarios.
