To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to consider whether it follows the given problem description: "Write a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word."

1. The function `func_1(s)` checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which means it ignores the first and last characters of the string.

2. Now, let's evaluate the assertions one by one:

   - `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: 
     - In this case, 'z' is indeed present in the substring `s[1:-1]` which is "ythonzabc". So this assertion is correct.
     
   - `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: 
     - Here, the string starts with 'z', hence the substring `s[1:-1]` is "xyabc", which does not contain 'z'. This assertion is also correct.
     
   - `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False`: 
     - For this input, `s[1:-1]` translates to " lang  ", which does not contain 'z'. This assertion is correct as well.

Now let's consider other potential edge cases that the function might not handle correctly:

- If the input string is "z", the function would return `False`, which is correct because there are no characters in the substring and 'z' is at the start.
- For strings like "abc z", the function would again ignore the spaces and 'z' would be present in the substring `s[1:-1]` which equates to "bc ". Therefore, it's important to note that the function should work regardless of white spaces inside the string.
  
- Let's test with empty strings and other cases:
  - `func_1('')` will cause an IndexError because `s[1:-1]` will be out of bounds. This case is not handled, which means the program does not behave correctly for an empty string.

Based on the reasoning above, we have established a scenario where the program does not work as intended (with an empty string, causing an IndexError).

Correctness: **False**
