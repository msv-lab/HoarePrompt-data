To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, letâ€™s break down the criteria and analyze the function implementation.

### Problem Description:
The function must check if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

### Annotated Program:
The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
    return False
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Range**: The function assumes that the input string `s` has at least one character, which is consistent with the problem description (since it does not mention handling empty strings).

2. **Slice Operation**: The condition `('z' in s[1:-1])` checks for the presence of 'z' in the substring of `s` starting from the second character (`s[1]`) to the second-to-last character (`s[-1]`) which is correctly interpreting "except at the start and end of the word". This means the first character (`s[0]`) and the last character (`s[-1]`) are excluded from the check.

3. **Return Values**: 
   - If 'z' is found in the substring `s[1:-1]`, it returns `True`.
   - If 'z' is not found, it correctly returns `False`, which is what the problem requires.

### Assertions:
The assertions given for testing the function:
- `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: This test case would likely fail since 'z' is in the middle of the string, but it would be outside the substring we're checking (which is empty in this case). Therefore, the expected result should actually be `False`.
- `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: Correctly returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
- `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False`: Correctly returns `False` because 'z' is not present anywhere.

### Conclusion:
While the slice and logic work correctly to check if 'z' is absent from the starting and ending positions, the first assertion suggests that the expected output for `func_1('pythonzabc.')` is incorrect, indicating the misunderstanding that the input used does not fit the required output derived from general handling.

Thus, since the function passes the assertions (with noted expected outputs) and logically processes the requirement set out in the problem description,

Correctness: **True**
