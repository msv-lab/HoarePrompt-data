Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1(s)` does not handle an empty string, leading to an IndexError. The logic of checking for 'z' in the substring `s[1:-1]` is correctly implemented according to the problem description for valid non-empty strings. However, the function fails for edge cases including strings that are empty, which would lead to a runtime error. Since the problem description does not specify that inputs will only be valid or non-empty strings, the original assessment that the program's correctness is flawed due to this oversight is justified. Hence, the final conclusion aligns with the original assessment that the program is not correct.
