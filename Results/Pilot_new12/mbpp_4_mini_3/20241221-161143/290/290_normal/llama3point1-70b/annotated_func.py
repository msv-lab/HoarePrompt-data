#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z'.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z', `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`, if `words` contains at least one word with length greater than 1 and 'z' in the substring from the second to the second-to-last character, the loop will return True; otherwise, the loop completes without returning, and no 'z' was found in the specified substrings of any words in `words`.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that no word in the list 'words' contains 'z' in the specified substring, and the loop completed without finding any 'z'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s`, ensuring that the first and last characters are not 'z'. It splits the string `s` into words and checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the substring between the first and last characters. If any such word is found, the function returns `True`. If no words meet these criteria, the function returns `False`. Notably, the function does not handle the case when `s` is empty or consists solely of single-character words, which could lead to unintended behavior. Additionally, the function does not raise errors or handle invalid inputs, potentially allowing for unexpected results when invoked with strings that do not conform to the specified precondition.
