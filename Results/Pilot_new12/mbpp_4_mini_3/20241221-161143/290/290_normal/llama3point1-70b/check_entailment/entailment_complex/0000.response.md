Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it meets those requirements:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a single string parameter `s`, with the assumption that the first and last characters of this string are not 'z'. This aligns with the stipulation in the problem description that the function should check for the presence of 'z' in the interior of wordsâ€”not at the start or end.

2. The string `s` is split into individual words using the `split()` method. This allows the function to examine each word separately, which is necessary for the requirements of the task.

3. The function iterates through each word in the `words` list:
   - It checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 (to ensure there are characters between the first and last character).
   - It checks if 'z' is present in the substring of the word that excludes the first and last characters (using `word[1:-1]`). This directly corresponds to the requirement of checking for 'z' except at the start and end of the word.

4. If any word fulfills both conditions (length > 1 and contains 'z' in the specified substring), the function returns `True`.

5. If the function completes the loop without finding any words that meet the criteria, it returns `False`.

The program logic thus captures the essence of the problem description accurately. There are no missing edge cases for the expected valid input, and because the input is assumed to conform to the required preconditions, the function behaves as intended.
