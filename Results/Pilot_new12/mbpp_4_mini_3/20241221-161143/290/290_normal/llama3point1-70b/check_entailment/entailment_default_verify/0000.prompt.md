You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly check if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word. For example, if the input string is "zoo", this should return `False` because 'z' is at the start. Similarly, for the input "hello", the program does not check for the absence of 'z', so it will wrongly return `False` where there are no 'z' characters. However, an important case to consider is "zabz", which contains 'z' in the middle but also has 'z' at the start and end. The code would incorrectly return `True` where it should return `False`. Thus, it does not correctly handle the requirements defined in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s`, ensuring that the first and last characters are not 'z'. It splits the string `s` into words and checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the substring between the first and last characters. If any such word is found, the function returns `True`. If no words meet these criteria, the function returns `False`. Notably, the function does not handle the case when `s` is empty or consists solely of single-character words, which could lead to unintended behavior. Additionally, the function does not raise errors or handle invalid inputs, potentially allowing for unexpected results when invoked with strings that do not conform to the specified precondition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
