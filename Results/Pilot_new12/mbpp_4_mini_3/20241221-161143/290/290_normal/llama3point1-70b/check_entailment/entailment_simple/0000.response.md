To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the given problem description, let's closely analyze both the problem statement and the implemented function.

### Problem Description:
The function must check if a string contains the letter 'z', but only at positions other than the start and end of the word.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()  # Splits the string into a list of words
    for word in words:
        # Checks if the word length is greater than 1 and if 'z' exists in the substring from index 1 to -1 (not including first and last character)
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False  # If no word was found with 'z' not at the ends, return False
```

### Analysis:
1. **Splitting the String**: The function begins by splitting the input string `s` into words, which is a necessary step to process each word individually.
   
2. **Iterating through Words**: The function then loops through each word to check for the presence of 'z'. The condition `len(word) > 1` ensures that it only checks words with more than one character.

3. **Substring Check**: The check `'z' in word[1:-1]` accurately checks for the presence of 'z' in the portion of the word that excludes both the first and last character.

4. **Return Values**: If any word meets the criteria (contains 'z' in the proper portion), the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding such a word, it returns `False`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly adheres to the problem description by:
- Checking each word independently after splitting the string.
- Effectively looking only in the relevant part of each word (ignoring the first and last characters).
- Returning the correct boolean value based on the presence of 'z'.

Therefore, since the program meets all the requirements laid out in the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
