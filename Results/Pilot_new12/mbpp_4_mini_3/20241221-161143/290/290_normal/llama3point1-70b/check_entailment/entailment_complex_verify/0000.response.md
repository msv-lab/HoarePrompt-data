The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly check if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word, and provided examples to substantiate this claim. Upon reviewing the annotated version of the program, it becomes clear that the program's logic indeed attempts to check for 'z' in the substring of each word excluding the first and last characters. However, the original assessment overlooked some details.

The function is correctly implemented in the sense that:

1. It ignores occurrences of 'z' in the first and last characters of each word due to the check `word[1:-1]`.
2. It accurately returns `False` for cases where there are no valid occurrences of 'z' within the middle of any words.
3. The program's flow handles edge cases like single-character words well, since it would bypass them with the length check `len(word) > 1`.

Despite these points, the original assessment rightly identifies issues in specific scenarios. For instance:
- If the input string is "zabz", this scenario is not correctly handled because since it finds a 'z', the return will be `True` despite having 'z' at the start and end which violates the requirements of the problem statement.
- Furthermore, it does not explicitly confirm the absence of 'z' at the start and end in the context provided by the problem description, as 'z' in those positions does not prevent identifying 'z' in between characters.

Thus, the function behaves incorrectly when there are 'z's at the start or end of words, as it should return `False` for those words.

Given this reasoning aligns with the original assessment, I maintain that the original assessment is accurate. The program does not satisfy all conditions of the problem description and should return `False` in certain conditions laid out.

Final: **False**
