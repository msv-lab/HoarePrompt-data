Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it misses cases where the input string `s` is empty or consists solely of single-character words, which should return `False` because there can be no 'z' in the middle of such words. For example:

- If `s` is an empty string `""`, the output should be `False` since there are no words to process.
- If `s` is `"z"`, the output should also be `False` as it consists of a single character with 'z' at the start and end.

The code currently does not account for these scenarios, which should be explicitly excluded according to the problem description. Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirements in every potential case.
