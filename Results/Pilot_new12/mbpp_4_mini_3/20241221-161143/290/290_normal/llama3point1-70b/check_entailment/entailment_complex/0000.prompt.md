You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z'.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z', `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`, if `words` contains at least one word with length greater than 1 and 'z' in the substring from the second to the second-to-last character, the loop will return True; otherwise, the loop completes without returning, and no 'z' was found in the specified substrings of any words in `words`.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that no word in the list 'words' contains 'z' in the specified substring, and the loop completed without finding any 'z'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s`, ensuring that the first and last characters are not 'z'. It splits the string `s` into words and checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the substring between the first and last characters. If any such word is found, the function returns `True`. If no words meet these criteria, the function returns `False`. Notably, the function does not handle the case when `s` is empty or consists solely of single-character words, which could lead to unintended behavior. Additionally, the function does not raise errors or handle invalid inputs, potentially allowing for unexpected results when invoked with strings that do not conform to the specified precondition.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
