You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program checks for the presence of the letter 'z' in each word of the input string, but it does not correctly handle the case where the input word itself is a single letter 'z' or does not meet the criteria:

1. If the input string is "z" (a single letter), the function will return `False`, which is incorrect because the problem statement does not specify that single-letter words should be excluded from consideration; the function does not mention that it should check the presence of 'z' in just one-letter words, but it does not handle them correctly either.
  
2. Another failure case is if the input string is "azb", the function would return `True` since 'z' is present and not at the start or end. However, if the input string was "a b z c", it would still return `False` even though there are cases where 'z' is correctly positioned.

Therefore, since there are examples where the function does not meet the specifications in the problem description, the return value is incorrect. The function does not handle edge cases, specifically when words consist of only a single letter 'z', that could lead to an incorrect output.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z'.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z', `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`, if `words` contains at least one word with length greater than 1 and 'z' in the substring from the second to the second-to-last character, the loop will return True; otherwise, the loop completes without returning, and no 'z' was found in the specified substrings of any words in `words`.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that no word in the list 'words' contains 'z' in the specified substring, and the loop completed without finding any 'z'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
