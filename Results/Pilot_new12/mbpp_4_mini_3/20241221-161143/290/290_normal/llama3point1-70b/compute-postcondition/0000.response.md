The code splits the string `s` into a list of words, which is assigned to the variable `words`. The original string `s` remains unchanged. The state of the other variables is not affected, and we can conclude that `words` will contain a list of substrings obtained from `s`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z'; `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`.**
