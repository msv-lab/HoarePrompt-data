Postcondition: ***`s` is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z', `words` contains at least 3 words, and `word` is the third word in the list (index 2). If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and 'z' is present in the substring of `word` from index 1 to the second-to-last character, the program returns True. Otherwise, the program executes without returning any value.***
