Postcondition: ***`s` is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z', `words` must contain at least 2 words, `word` is the second word in the list, and index is 1. If `word` has a length greater than 1 and contains 'z' in its substring (excluding the first and last characters), the function returns True. If these conditions are not met, there is no return value from the function.***
