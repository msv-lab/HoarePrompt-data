Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s`, ensuring that the first and last characters are not 'z'. It splits the string `s` into words and checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the substring between the first and last characters. If any such word is found, the function returns `True`. If no words meet these criteria, the function returns `False`. Notably, the function does not handle the case when `s` is empty or consists solely of single-character words, which could lead to unintended behavior. Additionally, the function does not raise errors or handle invalid inputs, potentially allowing for unexpected results when invoked with strings that do not conform to the specified precondition.**
