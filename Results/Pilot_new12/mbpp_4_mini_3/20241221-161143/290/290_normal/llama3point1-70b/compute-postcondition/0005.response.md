According to the code, the ability of the loop to execute one more time depends on the `words` list. If the list contains at least 2 words, the loop can execute for the second word. At the end of the last iteration, `words` must contain at least 1 word, and `word` is the first word (index 0). For the loop to execute again, `word` must be replaced with the next word in the list, which would be the second word (index 1). Therefore, the index needs to be updated to 1.

Since the conditions for `word` state that its length is less than or equal to 1 or that 'z' is not present in the substring of `word` (from the second character to the second-to-last), we must retain the existing conditions regarding the `words` list size.

State: **`s` is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z', `words` must contain at least 2 words, `word` is the second word in the list, and index is 1**.
