According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. The loop will execute if there is at least one word in the list. Given that `s` is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z', and it is split into a list of words, we need to ensure that `words` is not empty.

At the end of the last iteration, `word` will represent the last word in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, the `words` list must contain at least one word. To satisfy this condition, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`s` is a string where the first and last characters are not 'z', `words` must contain at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the list, and the index of the word iteration is 0**
