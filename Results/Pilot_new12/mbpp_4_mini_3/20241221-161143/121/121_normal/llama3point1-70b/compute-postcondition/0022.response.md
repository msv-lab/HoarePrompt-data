The value of `num` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 8 to 9. The other variables, `n` and `count`, remain unchanged. The conditions and states regarding `func_1(num)` and other comparisons remain valid after the increment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 3, and `num` is 9. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 3, `num` is 9**
