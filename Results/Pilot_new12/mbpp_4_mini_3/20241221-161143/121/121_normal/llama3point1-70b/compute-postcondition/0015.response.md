`num` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 7 to 8. The variable `count` remains 2, and `n` stays a positive integer greater than 1. The condition that `func_1(num)` returns true implies that the current value of `num` (which is now 8) would not affect the validity of the `count` and `n` constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n` is greater than 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 8; if the function `func_1(num)` returns true, then the value of `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n` is greater than 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 8; if the function `func_1(num)` returns true, then the value of `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
