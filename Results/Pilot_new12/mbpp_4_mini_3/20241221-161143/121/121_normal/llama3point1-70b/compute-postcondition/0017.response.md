The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 2, so after the operation, `count` will be 3. The other variables `n` and `num` remain unaffected by this operation. Additionally, since `count` is not equal to `n` (which is greater than 1), the precondition regarding `count` not equaling `n` still holds. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n` is greater than 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 8; if the function `func_1(num)` returns true, then the value of `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
