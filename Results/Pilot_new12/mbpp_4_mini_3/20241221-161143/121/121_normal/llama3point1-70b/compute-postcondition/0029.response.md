The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `num` was 9, after executing the code, `num` becomes 10. The states of the other variables (`n` and `count`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 4, and `num` is 10. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 4, `num` is 10.**
