The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1`. After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on various conditions: 

- In Case 1, the program returns the value 7. 
- In Case 2, the program returns the value of `num`, which is 7.
- In Case 3, the program returns the value of `num`, which is 8, if `count` is 3, `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `count` is not equal to `n`.
- In Case 4, the program returns `num`, which is 9.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return values based on specific conditions involving other variables such as `num` and `count`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, a positive integer, and returns different values (7, 8, or 9) based on the specified conditions surrounding the variables `num` and `count`.**
