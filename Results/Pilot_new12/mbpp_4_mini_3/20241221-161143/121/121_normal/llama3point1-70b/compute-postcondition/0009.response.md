The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so the new value of `count` will be 2. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n` is greater than 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 7; the function `func_1(num)` returns true; the current value of `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.**
