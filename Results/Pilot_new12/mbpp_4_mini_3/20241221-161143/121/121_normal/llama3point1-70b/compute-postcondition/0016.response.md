According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to execute indefinitely unless a break condition is met within the loop body. Since we are instructed to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration if the loop can certainly execute one more time, there are no states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1` and `n` is greater than 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 8; if the function `func_1(num)` returns true, then the value of `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
