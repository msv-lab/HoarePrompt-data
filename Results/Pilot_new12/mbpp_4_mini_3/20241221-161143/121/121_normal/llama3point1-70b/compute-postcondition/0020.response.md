Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 3, and `num` is 8. If `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, then the function returns the value of `num`, which is 8, provided `count` is not equal to `n`. Otherwise, if `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5, the execution does not return a value.***
