In the case of a `while True` loop, the loop is designed to execute indefinitely. There is no condition that would prevent the loop from continuing; it will execute at least one more time irrespective of the current state variables.

Thus, since there is no need to alter any variables to allow for the loop to run again, we simply retain the previous state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 3, `num` is 9**.
