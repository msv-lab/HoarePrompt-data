Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The main issues are as follows:

1. The annotations for `func_1` suggest that it does not explicitly handle even numbers greater than 2, as it only checks odd numbers in the `for` loop. While this is acceptable because even numbers are not prime (except for 2), the way the code is structured implies that if given an even number (other than 2), it would incorrectly determine its primality.

2. The logic in `func_2` is supposed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number but does not handle the counting correctly. After returning 7 when n equals 1, it needs to find primes that meet the criteria for subsequent values of `n`. However, if the search for primes after 7 does not yield any, the code could potentially enter an infinite loop, as stated in the annotations, indicating poor termination conditions.

3. An important logical flaw emerges around the handling of newman–shanks–williams primes themselves. There are specific numbers that are classified as Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, and if the counting logic fails due to the conditions around `num % 6`, the implementation would not be able to correctly return valid results for `n > 1`.

Thus, due to these points, particularly the potential for an infinite loop for valid inputs and the incomplete checks for primes, the code fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
