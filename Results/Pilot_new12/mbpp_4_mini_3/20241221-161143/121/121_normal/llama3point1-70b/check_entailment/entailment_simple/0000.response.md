Correctness: **True**

The provided program successfully meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. Here's the explanation for its correctness:

1. **Functionality of `func_1(n)`**: This function checks whether a given number `n` is prime. It effectively filters out numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`, which is the standard method for primality testing. This function is crucial for the construction of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime sequence.

2. **Functionality of `func_2(n)`**: This function is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number:
   - It starts by returning 7 for the first prime, complying with the established definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.
   - It then enters a loop where it increments `num` starting from 7, checking if `num` is prime using `func_1(num)`.
   - It also checks if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, which is a characteristic of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The function counts such primes and stops when it has found the nth one.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**: The function handles all cases effectively based on the assumption that input `n` is always a non-negative integer. The conditional checks ensure valid counts and return the correct prime when `count` reaches `n`.

In conclusion, the program correctly identifies the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number according to the problem description. Thus, it follows the requirements correctly and consistently.
