You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that n >= 0.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, as n is a non-negative integer less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 9, `i` is an integer such that `2 <= i <= int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns False. If `n` is even and greater than or equal to 4, it also returns False. For values of `n` that are 2 or greater and odd (including 3), the function enters a loop to check for factors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is evenly divisible by any of these factors, it returns False, indicating `n` is not prime. If none of these conditions are met, it concludes the checks and returns True, indicating that `n` is prime. Notably, the function does not explicitly address all even numbers, odd numbers or specific cases (like 1 being a non-prime), and lacks handling for negative thought even though it only takes non-negative integers as input. Overall, the function determines the primality of `n` by returning a boolean value based on these checks.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that n >= 1.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns the value 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 1`, and `n` is greater than 1.
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `count` is equal to `n`; `num` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies `func_1(num)` returning true and `num % 6` being either 1 or 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input, where `n >= 1`. It returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Specifically, if `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For any other positive integer `n`, the function enters an infinite loop starting from the number 7, iterating through integers while counting the valid primes that meet specific criteria: they must be prime according to an external function `func_1`, and when taken modulo 6, they must yield either 1 or 5. When the count of valid primes equals `n`, the function returns that prime number. This means the function can potentially return numbers greater than 7, depending on `n`. Edge cases include the behavior when `n = 1` versus `n > 1`, and the only guaranteed return value from the current logic is 7 for `n = 1`. For `n > 1`, the actual return values can be variable, depending on the operation of `func_1`. The code lacks validation for the input and may run indefinitely if there are no suitable prime numbers found.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
