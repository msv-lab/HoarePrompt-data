The function `func_2(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input, where `n >= 1`. It returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Specifically, if `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For any other positive integer `n`, the function enters an infinite loop starting from the number 7, iterating through integers while counting the valid primes that meet specific criteria: they must be prime according to an external function `func_1`, and when taken modulo 6, they must yield either 1 or 5. When the count of valid primes equals `n`, the function returns that prime number. This means the function can potentially return numbers greater than 7, depending on `n`. Edge cases include the behavior when `n = 1` versus `n > 1`, and the only guaranteed return value from the current logic is 7 for `n = 1`. For `n > 1`, the actual return values can be variable, depending on the operation of `func_1`. The code lacks validation for the input and may run indefinitely if there are no suitable prime numbers found.
