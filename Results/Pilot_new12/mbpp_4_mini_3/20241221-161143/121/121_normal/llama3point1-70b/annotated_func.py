#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns False. If `n` is even and greater than or equal to 4, it also returns False. For values of `n` that are 2 or greater and odd (including 3), the function enters a loop to check for factors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is evenly divisible by any of these factors, it returns False, indicating `n` is not prime. If none of these conditions are met, it concludes the checks and returns True, indicating that `n` is prime. Notably, the function does not explicitly address all even numbers, odd numbers or specific cases (like 1 being a non-prime), and lacks handling for negative thought even though it only takes non-negative integers as input. Overall, the function determines the primality of `n` by returning a boolean value based on these checks.

    if (n == 1) :

    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `count` is equal to `n`; `num` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 7 that satisfies `func_1(num)` returning true and `num % 6` being either 1 or 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input, where `n >= 1`. It returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Specifically, if `n` is 1, the function returns 7. For any other positive integer `n`, the function enters an infinite loop starting from the number 7, iterating through integers while counting the valid primes that meet specific criteria: they must be prime according to an external function `func_1`, and when taken modulo 6, they must yield either 1 or 5. When the count of valid primes equals `n`, the function returns that prime number. This means the function can potentially return numbers greater than 7, depending on `n`. Edge cases include the behavior when `n = 1` versus `n > 1`, and the only guaranteed return value from the current logic is 7 for `n = 1`. For `n > 1`, the actual return values can be variable, depending on the operation of `func_1`. The code lacks validation for the input and may run indefinitely if there are no suitable prime numbers found.
