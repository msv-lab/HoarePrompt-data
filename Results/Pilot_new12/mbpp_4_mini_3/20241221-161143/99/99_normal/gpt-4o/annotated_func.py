#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
    #The program returns a string that consists of characters from 's' at even indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single string parameter `s` and returns a new string that consists of characters from `s` at even indices. If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string as well. The function does not handle any special cases regarding non-string inputs or perform any validation on the input.
