Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` and removes characters found at odd indices, retaining only those at even indices. The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases confirming that the function behaves as expected.

Here's why the program is correct:

- The function iterates through the indices of the string `s` using `range(len(s))` and checks if the index `i` is even by evaluating `i % 2 == 0`.
- If the index is even, the character at that index (`s[i]`) is included in the result.
- The final result is created by joining the characters included in the list comprehension, which constructs the string with characters at even indices.
  
The assertions tested various strings and correctly showed that the returned output matches the expected output for each case. Additionally, the logic correctly applies to any string of any length, including edge cases like empty strings and single-character strings:

- For an empty string input `''`, the output is also `''`, which is correct.
- For a single-character string input `'a'`, the output is `'a'`, which is also correct.

Since the implementation meets all the conditions of the problem description for all tested cases and can handle edge cases, the correctness of the program stands confirmed.
