Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input is not a string. Although the problem description requests a function to remove characters with odd index values of a string, the function does not check if the input is a valid string type. 

For example, if the input is an integer or a list, the function would raise a TypeError when trying to iterate over the input, as it expects a string. Since the requirement was to remove characters based on their index values without specifying that the input will always be a string, the lack of handling for non-string inputs leads to incorrect behavior. 

Thus, since the function fails to fulfill the requirements for all potential cases, the correctness is deemed false.
