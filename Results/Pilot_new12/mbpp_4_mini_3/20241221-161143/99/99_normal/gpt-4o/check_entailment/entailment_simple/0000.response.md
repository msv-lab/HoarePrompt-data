Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. The problem states that the goal is to remove characters with odd index values from the given string. However, the implementation of the function `func_1(s)` returns characters at even indices instead. 

To be compliant with the problem statement, the program should remove characters at odd indices and return a string composed solely of characters at those indices. 

For example, for the input 'abcdef':
- The expected output after removing characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5) would be 'ace' (characters at indices 0, 2, 4).
- While the output of the program matches the expected result for the given test cases, this is purely coincidental because the function is not correctly implementing the specified requirement of "removing characters with odd index values". 

Thus, while the function behaves correctly for the specific examples provided, it does not meet the stated requirement of the problem description in terms of its logical operation.
