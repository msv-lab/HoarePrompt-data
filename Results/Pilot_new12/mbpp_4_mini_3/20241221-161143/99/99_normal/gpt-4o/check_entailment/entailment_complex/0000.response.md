Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description. The problem description specifies that the function should "remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string." However, the implementation of `func_1` instead returns a string consisting of characters from the input string at even index values. 

This means that for an input string like "abcdef", instead of removing characters at odd indices ('b', 'd', 'f') as the problem description states, it retains the characters at even indices ('a', 'c', 'e') and gives the result 'ace'.

Therefore, the implementation does not align with the requirement to remove characters at odd indices, which makes the function incorrect according to the problem description.
