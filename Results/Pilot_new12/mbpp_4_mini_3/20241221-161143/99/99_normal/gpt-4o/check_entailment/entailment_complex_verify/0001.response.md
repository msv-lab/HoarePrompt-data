The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **True** and provides reasoning supporting that claim. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a string as input and correctly returns a new string consisting only of the characters at even indices, which aligns with the problem description: "Write a python function to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string."

The assertions provide examples that demonstrate the function behaves as expected for various test cases, confirming that the implementation is functioning correctly. The annotations also clarify that for an empty string input, the function will return an empty string, which is a key element of the expected behavior.

Given that the original assessment aligns with the problem description and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation, it is reasonable to maintain that the program meets the necessary requirements.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Final: **True**
