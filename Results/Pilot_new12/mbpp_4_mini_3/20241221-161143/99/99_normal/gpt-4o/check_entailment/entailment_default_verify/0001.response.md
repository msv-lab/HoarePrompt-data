Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description by removing characters at odd indices from a given string and returning a new string with characters at even indices. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, successfully returning an empty string for an empty input and correctly handling the specified test cases. While the function does not include input validation for non-string instances, it is stated that valid input will be provided, thus confirming its correctness under the conditions described.
