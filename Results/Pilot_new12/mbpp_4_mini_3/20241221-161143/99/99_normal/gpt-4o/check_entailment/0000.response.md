Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. 

- For the input `'abcdef'`, the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `'a'`, `'c'`, and `'e'`, resulting in `'ace'`.
- For the input `'python'`, the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `'p'`, `'t'`, and `'o'`, resulting in `'pto'`.
- For the input `'data'`, the characters at even indices (0, 2) are `'d'` and `'t'`, resulting in `'dt'`.
- For the input `'lambs'`, the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `'l'`, `'m'`, and `'s'`, resulting in `'lms'`.

Since all cases mentioned in the assertions are handled correctly and there is no edge case identified where the program fails to meet the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
