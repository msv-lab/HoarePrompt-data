Explanation: The provided function `func_1` aims to remove characters from a string `s` based on their index values, specifically retaining the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.). According to the problem description, this is the correct behavior, as the goal is to keep characters at odd indices. The output hints clarify that the function returns every second character, starting with the first character, which aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, there are no discrepancies or missed edge cases identified in the behavior of the code.

Correctness: **True**.
