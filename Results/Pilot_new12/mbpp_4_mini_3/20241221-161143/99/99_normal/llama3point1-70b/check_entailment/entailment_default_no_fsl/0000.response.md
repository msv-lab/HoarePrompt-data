Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires the function to remove characters at odd indices of the input string, but the implementation of `func_1` is actually retaining characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) instead. This is contrary to the stated requirement of removing characters with odd index values. 

For example, given an input string `s = "abcdef"`, the correct output according to the problem description would be `"bdf"` (removing characters at odd indices), but the function currently returns `"ace"` (including characters at even indices). Since the function does not produce the expected output for this fundamental requirement, the program is incorrect.
