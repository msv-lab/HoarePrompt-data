Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly concludes that the program meets the problem description. The annotated version supports this by clarifying that the function `func_1` correctly constructs a new string by joining every second character from the original string `s`, effectively retaining characters at even indices and removing those at odd indices. This behavior aligns with the requirements outlined in the problem description. Additionally, all possible edge cases have been considered and found to be handled appropriately. Therefore, the function behaves as expected, confirming its correctness.
