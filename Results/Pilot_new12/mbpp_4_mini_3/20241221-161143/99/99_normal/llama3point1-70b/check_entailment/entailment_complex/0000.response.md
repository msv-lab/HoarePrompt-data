Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description specifies that the function should "remove the characters which have odd index values" of a given string. However, the implemented function instead returns a new string created by joining every character at an even index (0, 2, 4, etc.), effectively including characters that are located at even indices while omitting those at odd indices.

For example, given the input string "abcdef", the correct output, as per the problem description, should be "ace", which consists of the characters at even indices (0 and 2 and 4). However, the program would return "ace" as it is extracting characters at even indices correctly but does not address the removal of those at odd indices directly since their removal is supposed to mean that they should not appear in the return at all.

Thus, since the function does not perform the required action of removing characters located at odd indices, it does not satisfy the problem description correctly.
