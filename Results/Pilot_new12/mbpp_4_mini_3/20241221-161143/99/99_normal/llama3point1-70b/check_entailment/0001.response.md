To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to examine both the description and the function logic.

**Problem Description:** 
The task is to write a function that removes characters from a string that have odd index values. This implies that we should retain characters that are at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). 

**Program Logic:**
```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join((s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)))
```
This function uses a generator expression to iterate through the string `s`, starting at index 0 and incrementing by 2 each time. The characters at these even indices are selected and then joined together to form the resulting string, which is then returned.

**Analysis of Correctness:**
- For an empty string `""`, the output should be `""` (correct).
- For a string of one character e.g., `"a"`, the output should be `"a"` (correct).
- For a string with an even number of characters, e.g., `"abcdef"`, the output should be `"ace"` (correct).
- For a string with an odd number of characters, e.g., `"abcde"`, the output should be `"ace"` (correct).

In every scenario analyzed, the function correctly retains the characters at even indices and discards those at odd indices. 

Since there is no found case where the function does not perform as described, we can confidently conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The function behaves as expected for all possible cases examined based on the problem description.
