Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. It removes characters from the input string which have odd index values. 

To elaborate:
- The function uses a generator expression `(s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2))`, which iterates over the string `s` with a step of 2, thus taking characters at even indices only.
- The `join` method then concatenates these characters together, effectively discarding the characters at odd indices.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases of the input string (including empty strings and strings of varying lengths), I cannot identify any input for which this function does not work as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
