The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a new string that consists of every second character from `s`, starting with the first character. If `s` is empty, the function returns an empty string. The function does not perform any checks or validations on the input string, so it will also include any non-alphabetic characters that may be present in `s`. Additionally, the function unconditionally processes the entire string to create the result, which means that all characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) are included in the final output.
