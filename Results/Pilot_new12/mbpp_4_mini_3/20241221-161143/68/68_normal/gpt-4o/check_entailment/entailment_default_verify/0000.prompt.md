You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the real part is zero and the imaginary part is zero, which corresponds to the complex number "0 + 0j". In this case, the angle is undefined, and the function could return a specific value (like `0`), which would be misleading. The `cmath.phase` function does return `0` for `0 + 0j`, but this technically does not align with the problem description since it doesn't specify how to handle the zero complex number and the angle is not defined. 

Thus, there exists at least one input (specifically `func_1(0, 0)`) where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parameters and returns the phase angle of that complex number using `cmath.phase`. While the function correctly computes and returns the phase angle, it does not handle potential edge cases, such as invalid input types (non-numeric values) or cases where the real and imaginary parts are both zero, which could lead to an undefined phase. Therefore, the function's final state is that it returns a floating-point value representing the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number defined by the inputs, unless errors occur due to invalid types or zero inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
