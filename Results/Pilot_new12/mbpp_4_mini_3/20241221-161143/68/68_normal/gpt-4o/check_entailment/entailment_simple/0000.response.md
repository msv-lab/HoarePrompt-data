Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements set out in the problem description, which asks for a function that determines the angle (or phase) of a complex number. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(real, imag)` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. This matches the typical representation of a complex number in mathematics.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: Inside the function, the line `complex_number = complex(real, imag)` constructs a complex number using Python's built-in `complex()` constructor, which is the correct approach.

3. **Phase Calculation**: The program uses `cmath.phase(complex_number)` to calculate the phase angle of the complex number. The `cmath` module provides functions to work with complex numbers, and `phase()` returns the angle in radians, which is exactly what is needed for this problem.

4. **Validation with Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program test the function with various values, verifying that the function produces the expected results within a specified tolerance. This indicates that the function behaves correctly for at least the test cases provided.

5. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem statement specifies that valid input will be provided. Given this, the function handles the required input types and scenarios correctly.

Overall, the function entirely meets the problem description's requirements for calculating the angle of a complex number, justifying the conclusion that it is correct.
