Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description of computing the angle (or phase) of a complex number with the function `func_1`, which takes real and imaginary parts as input. 

The original assessment correctly identifies that while the function does not handle the case where both inputs are zero, the task description does not explicitly require handling this edge case. Since we assume that inputs will be valid and in line with typical scenarios of complex numbers (i.e., at least one non-zero component), the function works as intended and produces the correct angles for the provided test cases. 

Given that the annotations highlight that the function correctly computes the phase angle for specified inputs and follows the expected mathematical relationship using `cmath.phase`, we can conclude the function is operating correctly within the assumed constraints.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the original assessment aligns with the problem requirements under the stated assumptions, confirming that the overall correctness of the program is indeed valid.
