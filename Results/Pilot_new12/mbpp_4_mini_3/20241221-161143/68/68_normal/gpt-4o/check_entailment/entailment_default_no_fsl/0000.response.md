Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle edge cases where the real and imaginary parts are both zero. In the case of `func_1(0, 0)`, the phase angle is undefined. According to the output hints, the function should handle such cases, but it does not check for zero inputs, which can lead to an error or unexpected behavior. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
