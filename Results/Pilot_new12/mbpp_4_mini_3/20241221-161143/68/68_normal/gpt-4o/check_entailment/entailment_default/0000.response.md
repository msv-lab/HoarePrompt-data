The program aims to compute the phase angle of a complex number formed by given real and imaginary parts. The implementation uses the `cmath.phase` function to achieve this, which is acceptable for valid inputs representing complex numbers.

However, analyzing the provided code and output hints reveals that the function does not handle edge cases, specifically:
1. If both `real` and `imag` are zero (i.e., `func_1(0, 0)`), the phase of the complex number would be undefined. Although an assertion test for `0` is not provided, it should be taken into consideration.
2. The function does not check for invalid input types. As noted, the assumptions state valid inputs would be provided, but the program does not explicitly handle any invalid cases, such as non-numeric types.

Given these observations, the function, while operating correctly for typical inputs (like those shown in the assertions), does not robustly handle every potential case outlined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.
