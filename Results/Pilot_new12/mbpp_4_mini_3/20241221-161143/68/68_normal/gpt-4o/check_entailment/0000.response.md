Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the real part is zero and the imaginary part is zero, which corresponds to the complex number "0 + 0j". In this case, the angle is undefined, and the function could return a specific value (like `0`), which would be misleading. The `cmath.phase` function does return `0` for `0 + 0j`, but this technically does not align with the problem description since it doesn't specify how to handle the zero complex number and the angle is not defined. 

Thus, there exists at least one input (specifically `func_1(0, 0)`) where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem.
