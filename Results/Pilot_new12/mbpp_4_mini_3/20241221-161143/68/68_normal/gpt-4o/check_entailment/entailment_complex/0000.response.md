Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements set out in the problem description, which is to compute the angle (or phase) of a complex number. 

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. This aligns perfectly with the requirements of working with complex numbers.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: Within the function, a complex number is created using Python's built-in `complex()` function by passing the `real` and `imag` values. This is the correct and standard way to represent complex numbers in Python.

3. **Phase Calculation**: The function uses `cmath.phase()`, which is specifically designed to return the phase angle (in radians) of a complex number. This directly satisfies the task of obtaining the angle of the complex number.

4. **Function Assertions**: The assertions provided check the correctness of the function for specific complex number inputs against expected outputs. They validate that the function returns the expected phase angles, indicating that it works correctly under the tested scenarios.

5. **Assumptions in Input Validity**: The analysis also considers the assumption that inputs will always be valid. While the function does not explicitly handle cases such as invalid input types or both parts being zero, the statement confirms that valid inputs are always expected.

Since the function successfully calculates the phase of complex numbers as described, taking valid input, and correctly returns the expected output, it satisfies the problem requirements completely.

Thus, the program is correct, and we conclude with Correctness: **True**.
