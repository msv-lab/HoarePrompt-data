You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let’s analyze the problem description and the function provided.

**Problem Description:** Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.

**Program:**
1. The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number respectively.
2. The function constructs a complex number from the given real and imaginary values using `complex(real, imag)`.
3. The angle (or phase) of the complex number is obtained using `cmath.phase(complex_number)`.
4. The expected angles for several test cases are checked using assertions with a tolerance.

**Test Cases:**
- The assertions check if the angles of the complex numbers `0 + 1j`, `2 + 1j`, and `0 + 2j` return the expected values.

**Analysis of Potential Edge Cases:**
1. When both parts are zero: `func_1(0, 0)`. The angle of a complex number where both the real and imaginary parts are zero isn't well-defined in mathematics; it can result in a ValueError or return an undefined value.
2. Negative values for `real` and `imag`: These are not specifically addressed, but they should work correctly due to the nature of the atan2 function used in `cmath.phase`.
3. Very large numbers: There’s a potential issue concerning floating-point precision, but the nature of the `cmath.phase` function should handle typical floating-point operations.

Given that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where both the real and imaginary parts are zero, it is incomplete in its implementation. I will illustrate this with the specific case:

- Case `func_1(0, 0)`: The expected behavior is undefined, yet the program does not check for this scenario, which could lead to unexpected results or exceptions. 

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential input cases.

Correctness: **False** 

The program should ideally handle the case when both `real` and `imag` are zero to prevent undefined behavior or errors.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parameters and returns the phase angle of that complex number using `cmath.phase`. While the function correctly computes and returns the phase angle, it does not handle potential edge cases, such as invalid input types (non-numeric values) or cases where the real and imaginary parts are both zero, which could lead to an undefined phase. Therefore, the function's final state is that it returns a floating-point value representing the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number defined by the inputs, unless errors occur due to invalid types or zero inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
