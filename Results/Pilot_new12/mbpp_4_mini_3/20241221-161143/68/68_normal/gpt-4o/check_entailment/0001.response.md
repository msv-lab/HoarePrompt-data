To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let’s analyze the problem description and the function provided.

**Problem Description:** Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.

**Program:**
1. The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number respectively.
2. The function constructs a complex number from the given real and imaginary values using `complex(real, imag)`.
3. The angle (or phase) of the complex number is obtained using `cmath.phase(complex_number)`.
4. The expected angles for several test cases are checked using assertions with a tolerance.

**Test Cases:**
- The assertions check if the angles of the complex numbers `0 + 1j`, `2 + 1j`, and `0 + 2j` return the expected values.

**Analysis of Potential Edge Cases:**
1. When both parts are zero: `func_1(0, 0)`. The angle of a complex number where both the real and imaginary parts are zero isn't well-defined in mathematics; it can result in a ValueError or return an undefined value.
2. Negative values for `real` and `imag`: These are not specifically addressed, but they should work correctly due to the nature of the atan2 function used in `cmath.phase`.
3. Very large numbers: There’s a potential issue concerning floating-point precision, but the nature of the `cmath.phase` function should handle typical floating-point operations.

Given that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where both the real and imaginary parts are zero, it is incomplete in its implementation. I will illustrate this with the specific case:

- Case `func_1(0, 0)`: The expected behavior is undefined, yet the program does not check for this scenario, which could lead to unexpected results or exceptions. 

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential input cases.

Correctness: **False** 

The program should ideally handle the case when both `real` and `imag` are zero to prevent undefined behavior or errors.
