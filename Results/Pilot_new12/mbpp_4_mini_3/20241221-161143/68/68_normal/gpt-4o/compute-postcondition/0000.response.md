The variable `complex_number` is assigned the value of a complex number created by using the `complex` function with `real` and `imag` as its arguments. Since `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers, `complex_number` will hold the corresponding complex representation of these values. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_number` is a complex number equal to complex(real, imag)**.
