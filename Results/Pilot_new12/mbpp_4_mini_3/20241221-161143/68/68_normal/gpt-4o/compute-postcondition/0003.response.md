Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parameters and returns the phase angle of that complex number using `cmath.phase`. While the function correctly computes and returns the phase angle, it does not handle potential edge cases, such as invalid input types (non-numeric values) or cases where the real and imaginary parts are both zero, which could lead to an undefined phase. Therefore, the function's final state is that it returns a floating-point value representing the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number defined by the inputs, unless errors occur due to invalid types or zero inputs.**
