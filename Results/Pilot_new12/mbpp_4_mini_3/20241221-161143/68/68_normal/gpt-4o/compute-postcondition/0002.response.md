The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, the function returns the phase angle of the complex number defined by `real` and `imag`, calculated using `cmath.phase`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers representing a complex number and return its phase angle. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers, and returns the phase angle of the complex number defined by these parameters.**
