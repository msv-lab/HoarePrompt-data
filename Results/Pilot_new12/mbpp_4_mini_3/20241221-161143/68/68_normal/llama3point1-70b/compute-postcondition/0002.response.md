The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers that represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the phase (or argument) of the complex number created from `real` and `imag`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and return the phase of that complex number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers, and returns the phase of the complex number represented as complex(real, imag).**
