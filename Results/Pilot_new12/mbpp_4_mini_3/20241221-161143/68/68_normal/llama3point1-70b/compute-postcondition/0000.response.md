The variable `complex_num` is assigned the value created by combining `real` and `imag` into a complex number using the `complex` function. The other variables, `real` and `imag`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers, and `complex_num` is a complex number represented as `complex(real, imag)`.

Output State: **`real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers, `complex_num` is a complex number represented as `complex(real, imag)`**.
