Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to calculate the angle (or phase) of a complex number. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. It uses the `complex` function to create a complex number from the provided `real` and `imag` values.
2. The `cmath.phase` function is then called with the constructed complex number to compute its phase angle.

Since both methods used (creation of the complex number and calculation of its phase) are correctly implemented, the function meets the requirements laid out in the problem description for all valid inputs.

Therefore, the program does what the problem description specifies, and the correctness is confirmed.
