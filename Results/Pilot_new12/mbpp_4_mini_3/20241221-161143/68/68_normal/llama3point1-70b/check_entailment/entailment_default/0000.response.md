Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly implements a function to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number based on its real and imaginary components. The function leverages Python's `cmath` library, which handles complex numbers and computes their phase accurately in radians. 

According to the output hints, the function can manage cases where either or both parts of the complex number are zero without issues. Assuming valid floating-point inputs, it will always return the correct angle. There are no edge cases related to non-numeric input, as we assume valid inputs as stipulated in the task. Therefore, the function operates correctly across all expected scenarios.
