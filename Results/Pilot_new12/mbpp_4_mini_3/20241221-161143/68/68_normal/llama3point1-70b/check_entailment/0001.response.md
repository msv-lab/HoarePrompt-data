To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description ("Write a function to get the angle of a complex number"), we analyze the code.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. Inside the function, it constructs a complex number from the provided real and imaginary components using Python's built-in `complex` function. It then computes the angle (or phase) of the complex number using `cmath.phase`.

The function appears to handle the following cases correctly:
1. It constructs a complex number from the real and imaginary parts provided.
2. It computes the angle using `cmath.phase`, which correctly returns the angle in radians.

The `cmath.phase` function correctly handles the full range of complex numbers, including:
- Complex numbers in different quadrants (positive/negative real and imaginary parts).
- The special case where the complex number is purely real or purely imaginary, including `0` as input.

Let's consider some specific inputs to check its correctness:
- `func_1(1, 0)` should return `0.0` (angle of 1)
- `func_1(0, 1)` should return `1.5707963267948966` (angle of i)
- `func_1(-1, 0)` should return `3.141592653589793` (angle of -1)
- `func_1(0, -1)` should return `-1.5707963267948966` (angle of -i)
- `func_1(0, 0)` should return `0.0` (angle of 0)

All these values are consistent with the expected outcomes when computing the angle of complex numbers.

Since we cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
