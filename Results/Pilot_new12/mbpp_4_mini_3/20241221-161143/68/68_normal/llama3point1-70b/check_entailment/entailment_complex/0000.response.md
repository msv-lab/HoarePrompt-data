Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, as specified. The function then constructs a complex number from these inputs using Python's built-in `complex()` function.

The key functionality is provided by the `cmath.phase()` function, which calculates and returns the angle (or phase) of the complex number in radians. The annotations confirm that the function works correctly for all valid inputs, including cases where either the real part or the imaginary part is zero, or where both are non-zero.

Since the problem description states that the function is to return the angle of a complex number and the implementation accurately fulfills that requirement for valid floating-point inputs, we conclude that the program behaves correctly according to the problem description, thereby validating that the implementation is sound.
