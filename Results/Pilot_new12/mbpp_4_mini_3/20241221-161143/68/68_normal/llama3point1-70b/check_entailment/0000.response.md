Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly computes the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function, which returns the phase angle in radians corresponding to the complex number formed from the real and imaginary parts. 

The function takes two inputs, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number respectively. It then constructs a complex number and returns the phase angle. The behavior of the program is well-defined for all possible real and imaginary input values, including edge cases like zero. 

1. If both `real` and `imag` are zero, the angle is generally considered undefined in mathematics. However, `cmath.phase(0)` will return 0, which is a convention often used.
2. When `imag` is zero and `real` is positive, the angle is 0 radians. 
3. When `imag` is zero and `real` is negative, the angle is π radians (or -π).
4. For positive and negative values of `imag`, the function will correctly return the corresponding angles in the appropriate quadrants.

Given all these considerations, the function handles all potential inputs as expected. Thus, I conclude that the program behaves correctly according to the problem description.
