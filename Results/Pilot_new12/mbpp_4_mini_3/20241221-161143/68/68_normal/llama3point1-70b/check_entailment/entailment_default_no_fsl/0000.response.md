Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases of non-numeric inputs, as there are no safeguards or error handling mechanisms in place. While the output hints assume that valid floating-point numbers will be provided, the problem description does not explicitly guarantee this. Therefore, if a user were to provide non-numeric inputs, the program would raise an error, violating the reliability expected from the function. An example of such an incorrect case would be passing strings or other non-numeric types as arguments to `func_1`, which would lead to a `TypeError`. Since the function does not handle all potential input scenarios correctly, it cannot be considered correct.
