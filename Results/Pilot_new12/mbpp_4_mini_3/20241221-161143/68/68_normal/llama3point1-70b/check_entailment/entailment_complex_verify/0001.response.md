The annotated code clarifies the behavior of the function `func_1`. It confirms that the function takes two floating-point inputs which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, constructs the complex number, and computes its phase using `cmath.phase`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description that asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number.

The annotations also indicate that the function correctly handles cases where one or both parts of the complex number are zero, as well as the full range of possible values (positive and negative) for real and imaginary parts. It clearly states that the function assumes valid floating-point numbers are provided without additional error handling, which follows the given assumption of valid input.

Given that the function behaves correctly according to both the original assessment and the annotations provided, I see no discrepancies. The original assessment effectively addresses all necessary points including examples of expected outcomes, confirming accuracy.

Therefore, the final correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations is:

Final: **True**
