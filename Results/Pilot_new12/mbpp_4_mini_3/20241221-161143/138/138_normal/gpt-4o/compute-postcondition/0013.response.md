Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and an `element`. It searches for the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. If found, it returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence. If not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. The function properly handles cases where `arr` is empty or where `element` is not present. The annotations regarding the return values for different cases are mostly accurate but suggest a limitation based on the number of elements checked, which is not the actual behavior of the function. The function will search all elements in `arr`, not just the first three, and will return appropriate values based on the presence or absence of `element`.**
