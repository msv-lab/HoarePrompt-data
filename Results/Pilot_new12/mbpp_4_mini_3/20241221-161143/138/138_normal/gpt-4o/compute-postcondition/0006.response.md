Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `index` is 1, and `value` is the second element of `arr` which is not equal to `element`. If `value` equals `element`, the function returns True and the `index` value which is 1. If `value` does not equal `element`, the function does not return anything.***
