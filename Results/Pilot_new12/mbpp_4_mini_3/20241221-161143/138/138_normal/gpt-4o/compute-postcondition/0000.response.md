According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, `arr` must contain at least 1 element. At the start of the loop, `index` should be initialized to 0, and `value` should be set to the first element of the list `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element of `arr`**
