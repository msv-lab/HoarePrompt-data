The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. `arr` is a list, and `element` can be of any data type. The function checks if `element` exists in `arr` and returns different values based on the cases. 

- In Case 1, if the first element of `arr` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and the index `0`.
- In Case 2, if the second element of `arr` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and the index `1`.
- In Case 3, if the third element of `arr` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and the index `2`.
- In Case 4, if `element` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element and return whether the element is found in the list along with its index, or indicate it is not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an element. If `element` is found as the first, second, or third element in `arr`, it returns `True` along with the respective index; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1` if the element is not found in the list.**
