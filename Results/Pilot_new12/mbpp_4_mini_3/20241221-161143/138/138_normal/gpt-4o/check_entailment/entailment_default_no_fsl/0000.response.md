Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array `arr` and an `element`, and performs the following:

1. It iterates through the array using `enumerate`, allowing it to access both the index and the value of each element.
2. If it finds the `element` in the array, it returns a tuple `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the element in the array.
3. If the element is not found after checking all elements, it returns `(False, -1)`.

The function appears to handle all specified cases correctly:
- If the array is empty, it will return `(False, -1)`.
- If the element is not present in the array, it will correctly return `(False, -1)`.
- If the element is present, it will return the correct index of the first occurrence.

The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior and do not suggest any discrepancies in the implementation. Therefore, I conclude that the function meets the requirements fully and does so for every potential case based on the assertions provided.

Hence, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
