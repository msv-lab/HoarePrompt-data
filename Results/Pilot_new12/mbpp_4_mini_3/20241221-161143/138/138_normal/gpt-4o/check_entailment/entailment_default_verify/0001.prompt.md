You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as inputs. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, checking if the current value matches the specified element.

Here is how the function handles different cases based on the requirements:

1. **Element is present in the array:** The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element, as seen in the assertions like `assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)`.
   
2. **Element is not present in the array:** If the element is not found after the loop completes, the function returns `(False, -1)`, which correctly indicates the element is absent.

3. **Edge cases considered:** The function handles cases where:
   - The array is empty (returns `(False, -1)`).
   - The element is not present in the array (returns `(False, -1)`).
   - The element is the first or last element of the array (correctly returns its index).

Given these considerations and the proper handling of expected input scenarios, there are no identified potential cases where the function does not meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the function is correct as it behaves as expected for the provided inputs and scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and an `element`. It searches for the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. If found, it returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence. If not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. The function properly handles cases where `arr` is empty or where `element` is not present. The annotations regarding the return values for different cases are mostly accurate but suggest a limitation based on the number of elements checked, which is not the actual behavior of the function. The function will search all elements in `arr`, not just the first three, and will return appropriate values based on the presence or absence of `element`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
