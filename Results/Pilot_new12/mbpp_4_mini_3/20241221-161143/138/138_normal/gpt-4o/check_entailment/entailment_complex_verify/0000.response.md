The original assessment of the program's correctness is based on a solid understanding of the problem description and the provided implementation. The program effectively meets the requirements outlined in the problem: it takes an array and an element, searches for the element in the array, and returns a tuple indicating whether the element was found and its index position.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Version:
- The annotations confirm that before the function is called, the inputs `arr` and `element` are appropriately validated to meet the function's requirements.
- Inside the function, the loop indeed searches through all elements in the array until it finds a match or concludes that the element is absent.
- Upon finding the element, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, which correctly indicates that the element exists and provides the index of its first occurrence.
- If the element is not found, the function correctly returns `(False, -1)`.
- The function has also been tested with various edge cases, including scenarios where the array is empty or the element is not present, and it handles these cases correctly.

### Final Assessment:
Both the original assessment and the annotations combined present a consistent view that the program is implemented correctly according to the problem description. Importantly, since the assumption is that inputs will always be valid (as stated), there are no concerns regarding the handling of invalid inputs.

Therefore, given that the program fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description, and that the annotations confirm correct behavior during execution, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
