Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly implements a search function that checks for the presence of an element in an array and returns a tuple with a boolean and the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found. According to the output hints, the function `func_1` will return `(True, index)` if the `element` is present in `arr`, or `(False, -1)` if it is not. The logic of iterating through the array using `enumerate` effectively handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including situations where the array is empty or when the element is not found. Since there are no identified cases where the function fails to meet the specifications, the correctness of the implementation is validated.
