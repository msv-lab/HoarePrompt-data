Let's analyze the provided problem description and program:

## Problem Description
Write a function that takes in an array and an element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

## Provided Program
```python
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)
```

## Testing
The assertions provided in the task check for specific cases:
1. `func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31)` should return `(True, 3)`, which is correct.
2. `func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61)` should return `(True, 7)`, which is also correct.
3. `func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48)` should return `(True, 6)`, which is correct as well.

However, let's test an edge case where the element is not present in the array. For example:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)` is expected to return `(False, -1)`.

## Edge Case Test
Using our function with the above test case:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)` returns `(False, -1)`, which is also correct.

## Potential Missing Edge Cases
However, let's assess the performance when the input list is empty:
- `func_1([], 1)` should return `(False, -1)` because the element cannot be found in an empty array. 

Running this case:
- `func_1([], 1)` indeed returns `(False, -1)`, aligning with the expected behavior.

## Conclusion
Upon evaluating various relevant test cases, including edge cases, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description. It correctly identifies the presence of an element in an array, provides the correct index when found, and returns -1 otherwise.

Correctness: **True**.
