You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list, and element can be of any data type.
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list, if `element` is in `arr`, the output will be True and the index of the first occurrence of the `element`, otherwise the function does not return a value. `index` is the last index checked, and `value` is the last element checked in `arr`.
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False and -1, indicating that the element is not in the list 'arr' and there is no valid index for the element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and an `element`. It searches for the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`. If found, it returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence. If not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. The function properly handles cases where `arr` is empty or where `element` is not present. The annotations regarding the return values for different cases are mostly accurate but suggest a limitation based on the number of elements checked, which is not the actual behavior of the function. The function will search all elements in `arr`, not just the first three, and will return appropriate values based on the presence or absence of `element`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
