Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` checks for the presence of an element in the list and returns a tuple containing a boolean and the index of the found element or -1 if not found. 

The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios outlined in both the problem description and test cases. Specifically:

1. When the element is found, the function correctly returns `(True, index)` as shown by the assertions.
2. When the element is not present in the list, including the edge case of an empty list, the function returns `(False, -1)` as expected.
3. The annotations also validate the assumptions around the types of inputs and the correct state before and after the function call.

Thus, all provided information and the annotations support the assertion that the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The evaluation of both normal and edge cases reinforces that the function works correctly.
