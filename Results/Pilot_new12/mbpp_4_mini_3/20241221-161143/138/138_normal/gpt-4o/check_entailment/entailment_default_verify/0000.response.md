Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided program. The function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem statement â€” it searches for an element in an array and returns a tuple indicating whether the element was found and its index. Additionally, the function handles edge cases like an empty array properly by returning `(False, -1)`. The provided output hints support this conclusion as they confirm that the function behaves correctly in the designated scenarios, including cases where the element is present or absent. Overall, the assessments made align with the function's behavior, thus reaffirming its correctness.
