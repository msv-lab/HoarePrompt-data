Final: **True**

The program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description: it takes an array and an element as input, returning a tuple that indicates whether the element is present in the array and the index at which it appears. 

The annotations support this by detailing the state of the program at critical points, confirming that:
1. The function correctly identifies the presence of the element within the array.
2. It returns the corresponding index of the element if found and returns `(False, -1)` if not.

The assessment points out that both scenarios are handled correctly, including edge cases involving empty lists and different positions of the element. The program's behavior aligns with the expected outcomes described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate, and the program effectively meets its intended purpose.
