Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the problem description. While it does check if the element is in the array and returns a tuple indicating its presence and the index, the return values are not correctly formatted for all cases.

The function `func_1` should return a tuple containing:
1. A boolean indicating if the element is in the array.
2. The index position of the element if found, or -1 if not found.

The issue is in handling the return values. The line:

```python
return True, index
```

is used to return the presence of the element and its index, which is correct. However, the problem description requires that if the element is not found, the return should be `(False, -1)`.

The implementation correctly does this with:

```python
return False, -1
```

So the function `func_1` does accurately return the structure `(boolean, index)` as required. However, the function does not explicitly indicate handling the situation when the input is an empty listâ€”yet, per your problem context, we assume valid input is given.

Despite these nuances, the main misunderstanding arises from the return values formatting after verification, which can lead to misinterpretation of correctness. 

In conclusion, the program misses the conditional checks or specific handling regarding the case of empty input within the problem constraints, thus leading to a failure. Therefore, the program can return incorrect results if a specific condition/requirement wasn't stated in the problem description for previous cases.
