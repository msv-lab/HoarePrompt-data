Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the program's correctness is **True** is accurate. The function `func_1` meets the requirements set forth in the problem description by correctly returning a tuple indicating whether the specified `element` is within the provided array `arr` and, if found, the index of the first occurrence. 

The annotated version of the code confirms this behavior, stating that if the `element` is present in `arr`, the function returns `True` alongside the index. For cases where the `element` is absent, it correctly returns `False` and `-1`. Additionally, the annotations support that the function will appropriately handle various scenarios, including when the array is empty.

The annotations provide clear reasoning about the function at different stages, affirming that the expected outcomes align with the requirements of the problem description. There are no identified issues or limitations that would affect the function's correctness, and all functionalities have been validated through the assertions provided.

In conclusion, the function performs as required based on both the original assessment and the annotations, leading to the determination that the program is correct.
