Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in an array (`arr`) and an `element`, and it returns a tuple.

Here are the reasons why the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Boolean Indication**: The function checks whether the given `element` exists in the `arr`. If it finds the `element`, it returns `True` as part of the output tuple.

2. **Index Position**: If the `element` is found, the function correctly returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in `arr`. This is achieved using the `enumerate` function, which provides both the index and the value while iterating through the list.

3. **Handling Absence of Element**: If the `element` is not found after checking all the elements in `arr`, the function returns `False` and `-1`, indicating that the `element` is absent in the list.

4. **Exhaustive Search**: The loop iterates through the entire list and accurately identifies the presence of the `element`, ensuring all cases are covered.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided assert statements test the function with various cases, confirming its correct behavior when the element is present and when it is absent.

Overall, the program adheres to the expectations set out in the problem description by successfully returning the requisite boolean and index, and it handles all potential scenarios as assumed valid inputs.
