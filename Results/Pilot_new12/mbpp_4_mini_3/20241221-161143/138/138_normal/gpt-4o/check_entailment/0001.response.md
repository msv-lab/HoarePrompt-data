Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as inputs. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, checking if the current value matches the specified element.

Here is how the function handles different cases based on the requirements:

1. **Element is present in the array:** The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element, as seen in the assertions like `assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)`.
   
2. **Element is not present in the array:** If the element is not found after the loop completes, the function returns `(False, -1)`, which correctly indicates the element is absent.

3. **Edge cases considered:** The function handles cases where:
   - The array is empty (returns `(False, -1)`).
   - The element is not present in the array (returns `(False, -1)`).
   - The element is the first or last element of the array (correctly returns its index).

Given these considerations and the proper handling of expected input scenarios, there are no identified potential cases where the function does not meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the function is correct as it behaves as expected for the provided inputs and scenarios.
