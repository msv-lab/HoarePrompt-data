The program could raise a `ValueError` if the specified `element` is not found in the `array`. If the `element` is present, the function returns `True` and the index of the `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is not found, a `ValueError` occurs, and the program returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`. Therefore, the output state is: `array` is a list of elements, and `element` could be any type. If the element is found, the function returns `True` and its index; if it is not found, the function returns `False` and -1. 

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, and `element` can be any type. If the element is found, the function returns True and its index; if it is not found, the function returns False and -1.**
