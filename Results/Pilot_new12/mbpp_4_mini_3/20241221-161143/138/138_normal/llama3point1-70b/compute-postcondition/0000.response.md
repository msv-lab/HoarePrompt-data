The code assigns `index` the value of the position of `element` in the `array`. If `element` is present in `array`, `index` will hold its first occurrence position; if not present, it will raise a `ValueError`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, `element` is either present or not, `index` is the index of `element` in `array` if present, otherwise a ValueError occurs.**
