The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `element`. `array` is a list of elements, and `element` can be any type. If `element` is found in `array`, the function returns `True` along with its index; if it is not found, the function returns `False` and -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to check for the presence of a specified `element` in the `array` and return the respective result based on whether the element is found or not, including its index if found.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array` (a list of elements) and `element` (any type), returning `True` and the index of `element` if found, or `False` and -1 if not found.**
