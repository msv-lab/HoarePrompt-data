Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list called `array` and an `element` of any type. It searches for the `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the zero-based index of the `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is not found, a `ValueError` is triggered, and the function handles it by returning a tuple containing `False` and -1. The function does not modify the input `array`, and it effectively handles the case where the `element` might not be present in the list.**
