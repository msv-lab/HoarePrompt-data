Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the correctness of the function `func_1` is **True** is accurate. The function meets all the criteria laid out in the problem description:

1. **Handling of the input**: It takes a list (`array`) and an `element` and checks for the presence of the `element` in the list.
2. **Return values**: If the `element` is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, which corresponds to the index of the `element` in the list. If the `element` is not found, it handles the `ValueError` correctly by returning `(False, -1)`, which matches the requirement set in the problem description.
3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where the list may be empty or the element may not exist in the list without requiring additional checks, as it relies on Python's built-in exception handling.

The output hints further reinforce this conclusion, confirming that the function does not modify the input list, effectively utilizes the `index()` method, and properly manages both presence and absence conditions.

Given this information, the program is deemed correct in accordance with the problem description.
