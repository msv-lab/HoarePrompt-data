Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It successfully checks if the specified `element` exists in the provided `array`. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it appropriately catches the `ValueError` from the `.index()` method and returns `(False, -1)`.

The output hints support this assessment, clearly outlining the expected behavior of the function, including its handling of both cases â€” finding and not finding the element in the list. The hints also confirm that there are no modifications made to the input array, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

Given that the program functions correctly for any valid input scenarios, the final assessment of the program's correctness is correctly stated as True.
