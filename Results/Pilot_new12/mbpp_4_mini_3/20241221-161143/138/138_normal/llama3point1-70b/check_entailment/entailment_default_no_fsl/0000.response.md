Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the specified functionality as described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that accepts an `array` and an `element`, searches for the `element` in the `array`, and handles cases where the element is either found or not found.

1. If the `element` is found, the `index()` method returns its position, and the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the corresponding index.
2. If the `element` is not found, a `ValueError` is raised, which is caught by the `except` block. In this scenario, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1.

The function does not modify the input `array`, effectively handles both presence and absence of the `element`, and follows the required output format.

Since it successfully meets all the requirements described in the problem statement for all potential cases, the overall correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
