Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program implements the requirements of the problem description by taking an array and an element, and it correctly returns a tuple indicating whether the element is in the array, along with its index. The annotated version supports this conclusion by clearly explaining the flow of the program and confirming that the proper outputs are generated depending on whether the element is found or not. 

The annotations indicate that if the `element` is found, the program returns `(True, index)`; if not, it captures the `ValueError` and returns `(False, -1)`. This behavior aligns perfectly with the specified requirements. Thus, the function is correct for all valid input scenarios as described in the problem statement.
