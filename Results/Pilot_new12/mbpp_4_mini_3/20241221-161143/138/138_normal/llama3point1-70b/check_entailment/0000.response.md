Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, and it checks if the element is present in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it correctly handles the exception raised by the `.index()` method and returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. 

Hereâ€™s why the program works correctly for all potential cases:
1. If the element is in the array, `array.index(element)` finds its index and returns `(True, index)`.
2. If the element is not in the array, a `ValueError` is raised, which is caught in the `except` block, and the function returns `(False, -1)`.

Therefore, the function meets all specified requirements as per the problem description for any valid input scenario.
