Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program as it meets the problem description's requirements. The annotated version reinforces this conclusion by clearly outlining the function's behavior under different states. 

1. The function uses the `index()` method to determine if the `element` is present in the `array`. If the `element` is found, it correctly returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the `element`, which aligns with the requirement stated in the problem description.

2. If the `element` is not found, the `ValueError` is appropriately handled by the `except` block, returning a tuple of `False` and -1. This behavior is consistent with the problem requirement that states to return `-1` when the `element` is not present.

3. The annotated code effectively reaffirms that the function does not modify the input array, and handles all described cases, fulfilling the criteria given in the problem statement.

Overall, there is no evidence from the annotations to refute the correctness of the function, thus validating the conclusion of the original assessment.
