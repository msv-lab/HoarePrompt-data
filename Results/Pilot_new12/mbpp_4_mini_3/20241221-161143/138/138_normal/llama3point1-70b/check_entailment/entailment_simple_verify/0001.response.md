Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It effectively checks for the presence of an element in an array and returns a tuple with a boolean indicating existence and the corresponding index, or -1 if the element is not found.

1. The provided annotated version aligns with this functionality, describing that the `index` method retrieves the index if the element is present, and in case of absence, a `ValueError` is caught, returning the specified output of `(False, -1)`. This matches the expected behavior outlined in the assessment.

2. Additionally, the annotation correctly highlights that both possibilities are handled: finding the element and not finding it. Edge cases like empty arrays or input types that are valid within the function's expected behavior have also been noted. 

Therefore, the assessment of the functionâ€™s correctness in accomplishing its intended task is upheld. Thus, the conclusion is Final: **True**.
