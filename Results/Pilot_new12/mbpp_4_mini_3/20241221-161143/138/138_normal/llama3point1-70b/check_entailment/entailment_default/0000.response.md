Explanation: The program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` handles searching for an `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is present, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the `element`. If the `element` is not found, it captures the `ValueError` raised by the `index()` method and returns `(False, -1)`. The output hints align with the code's behavior, confirming that it does what is expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
