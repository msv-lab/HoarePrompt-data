Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input and Output Requirements**: The program defines a function `func_1` that accepts two parameters: an `array` (a list of elements) and an `element` (which can be of any data type). This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Element Search**: The program attempts to find the index of the `element` in the `array` using the list method `index()`. If the element is present, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the found element.

3. **Handling Non-Existence of Element**: If the `element` is not found within the `array`, a `ValueError` is raised. The program properly handles this exception with a try-except block, returning a tuple `(False, -1)`, indicating that the element was not found.

4. **Return Values**: The return values conform to the specification given in the problem description. If the element exists, it returns `True` and the index; if not, it returns `False` and `-1`.

The handling of valid input is naturally suited to the problem description's assumption that the user will provide valid input types, so the absence of additional checks for data types (such as ensuring `array` is a list) is not a deficiency given the problem's stipulation. Thus, the program functions correctly for any valid use cases as described.
