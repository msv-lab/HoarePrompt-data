Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it meets those requirements:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `array` (a list of elements) and `element` (which can be any type). This aligns with the description stating that the function should accept an array and an element.

2. **Element Search**: It uses the `index()` method to find the index of the `element` in the `array`. If the `element` is found, the program accurately returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the `element`. This matches the requirement to indicate the presence of the element in the array and to return its index.

3. **Handling Absence**: If the `element` is not found, a `ValueError` is raised, which is correctly caught by the `except` block. In this case, the function returns `False` and `-1`, as specified in the problem description.

4. **Tuple Return Type**: The function consistently returns a tuple, which is the expected output format based on the problem description.

5. **Robustness**: The function does not modify the input `array`, adhering to the expectation of not altering the input.

In summary, `func_1` effectively handles both cases (element found and not found) as outlined in the problem description. It returns the correct boolean value and index (or -1) based on the presence of the element in the array, thus fulfilling all requirements specified in the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed as **True**.
