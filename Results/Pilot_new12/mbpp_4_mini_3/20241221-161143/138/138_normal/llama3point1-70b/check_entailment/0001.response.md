Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input and correctly checks if the element is present in the array. 

1. If the element exists in the array, the `index()` method will return its index, and the function will return a tuple `(True, index)`, which matches the requirement.
2. If the element does not exist, a `ValueError` will be raised, which is caught by the `except` block, and it returns the tuple `(False, -1)`, again matching the requirement.

The function handles both presence and absence of the element correctly and covers edge cases, such as when the array is empty. It meets the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, no input cases can be constructed to show failure, confirming the program's correctness.
