Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes an array and an element as input and effectively checks for the presence of the element in the array using the `.index()` method. The annotated code supports this assessment, as it clearly states that the function will return a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element if found, or `False` and `-1` if a `ValueError` occurs, indicating the element is not present. The behavior described in the program aligns with the problem statement, and the annotations effectively illustrate the state of the program at key points, confirming the program's correctness.
