The code initializes `thirty_days_months` as a list containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which represent the months with 30 days. This does not change the value of `month`, but adds a new variable `thirty_days_months` to the state. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`month` is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive; `thirty_days_months` is [4, 6, 9, 11]**
