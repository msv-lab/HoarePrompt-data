Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter `month` that represents the month of the year (expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive). It checks if the given month has 30 days by determining if it is one of the months with 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11). The function returns `True` if the month is one of these four; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, the function does not handle the possibility of `month` being outside the expected range (1-12), which could lead to inaccurate results if an invalid month is provided.**
