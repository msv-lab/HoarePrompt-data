#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if month is in the list of thirty_days_months [4, 6, 9, 11], otherwise it returns False, indicating if the month has 30 days
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `month` that represents the month of the year (expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive). It checks if the given month has 30 days by determining if it is one of the months with 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11). The function returns `True` if the month is one of these four; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, the function does not handle the possibility of `month` being outside the expected range (1-12), which could lead to inaccurate results if an invalid month is provided.
