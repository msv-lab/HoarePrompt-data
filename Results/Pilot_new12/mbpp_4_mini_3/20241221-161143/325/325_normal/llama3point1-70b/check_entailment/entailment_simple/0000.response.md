Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that checks if a given month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that has 30 days. The months with 30 days are represented in the list `thirty_days_months`, which includes the month numbers 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), and 11 (November). 

The function utilizes the expression `month in thirty_days_months`, which accurately returns `True` for any valid input that corresponds to these months and `False` otherwise. Since the function assumes the input will always be an integer between 1 and 12, it does not require additional error handling for invalid inputs.

Overall, the program's logic aligns perfectly with the requirement to determine if a given month number corresponds to a month with 30 days, fulfilling the problem description.
