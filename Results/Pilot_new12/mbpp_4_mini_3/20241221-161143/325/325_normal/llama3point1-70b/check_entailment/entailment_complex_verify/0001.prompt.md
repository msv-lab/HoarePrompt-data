You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The function does not handle the full problem description correctly. Specifically, it should return whether a given month contains 30 days or not. However, it does not account for the cases when the month is February (2), which has 28 or 29 days, and it also does not handle invalid month numbers (like 0 or 13). 

For example:
- If the input is `2` (February), the correct answer should indicate that it does not have 30 days, but the function will return `False` since 2 is not in the list `thirty_days_months`.
- If the input is `1` (January), the function incorrectly indicates that it does have 30 days, as it returns `False` instead of `True` based on the problem requirement.

This clearly shows that the function does not cover all edge cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if month is in the list of thirty_days_months [4, 6, 9, 11], otherwise it returns False, indicating if the month has 30 days
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `month` that represents the month of the year (expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive). It checks if the given month has 30 days by determining if it is one of the months with 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11). The function returns `True` if the month is one of these four; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, the function does not handle the possibility of `month` being outside the expected range (1-12), which could lead to inaccurate results if an invalid month is provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
