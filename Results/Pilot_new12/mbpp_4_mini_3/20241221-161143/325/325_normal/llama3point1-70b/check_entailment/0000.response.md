Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly checks whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that has 30 days. The months with 30 days—April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11)—are stored in a list. The function simply checks if the input month is in this list, which effectively covers all possible inputs. Given the constraints specified in the problem description, it appears the function will return the correct output for all possible month numbers from 1 to 12. Thus, the logic is sound and aligns with the requirements.
