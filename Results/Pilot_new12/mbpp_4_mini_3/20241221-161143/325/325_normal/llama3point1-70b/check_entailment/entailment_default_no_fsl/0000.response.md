Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. While it correctly identifies whether a month has 30 days (specifically for April, June, September, and November), it fails to handle cases when the input value for `month` is outside the valid range of 1 to 12. For example, if the input is 0 or 13, the function will erroneously return `False`, even though those inputs are not valid month numbers. As a result, there are scenarios where the function does not work as intended based on the problem description, leading to incorrect outputs for invalid month inputs.
