Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully comply with the problem description because it doesn't explicitly handle the requirement that the month must be between 1 and 12. While the annotations assume that the input will be valid, the problem statement specifies that the input will be a number between 1 and 12, inclusive. Therefore, if an invalid month (such as 0 or 13) were passed to the function, it would produce an incorrect result. Instead of returning `True` or `False` based on the problem requirements, it could potentially return `False` for values outside the specified range without properly indicating the input was invalid. This oversight means the program does not meet the specification under all defined conditions.
