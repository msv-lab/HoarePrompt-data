Correctness: **False**

The function does not handle the full problem description correctly. Specifically, it should return whether a given month contains 30 days or not. However, it does not account for the cases when the month is February (2), which has 28 or 29 days, and it also does not handle invalid month numbers (like 0 or 13). 

For example:
- If the input is `2` (February), the correct answer should indicate that it does not have 30 days, but the function will return `False` since 2 is not in the list `thirty_days_months`.
- If the input is `1` (January), the function incorrectly indicates that it does have 30 days, as it returns `False` instead of `True` based on the problem requirement.

This clearly shows that the function does not cover all edge cases correctly.
