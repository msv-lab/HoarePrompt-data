Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The code checks if a given month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month with 30 days (April, June, September, and November). While it works correctly for valid inputs within the specified range, it does not handle cases where the input is outside of the expected range (1-12). For example, if a user inputs `0` or `13`, the function would return `False`, which is not the intended behavior according to the problem description, where only valid months should be considered. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
