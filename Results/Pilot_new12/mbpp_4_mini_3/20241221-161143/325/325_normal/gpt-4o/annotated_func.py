#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
    #The program returns True if month is one of the months in the set {4, 6, 9, 11}, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `month`, which is expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive. It checks whether this month is one of four specific months that have 30 days (April - 4, June - 6, September - 9, November - 11). The function returns `True` if `month` is one of these months; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function does not handle inputs outside the expected range (1-12), and no error handling is implemented for invalid inputs. Therefore, for invalid values of `month`, the behavior regarding the return value remains undefined.
