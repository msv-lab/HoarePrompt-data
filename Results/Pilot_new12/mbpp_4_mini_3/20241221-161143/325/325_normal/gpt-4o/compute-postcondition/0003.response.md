Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter `month`, which is expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive. It checks whether this month is one of four specific months that have 30 days (April - 4, June - 6, September - 9, November - 11). The function returns `True` if `month` is one of these months; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function does not handle inputs outside the expected range (1-12), and no error handling is implemented for invalid inputs. Therefore, for invalid values of `month`, the behavior regarding the return value remains undefined.**
