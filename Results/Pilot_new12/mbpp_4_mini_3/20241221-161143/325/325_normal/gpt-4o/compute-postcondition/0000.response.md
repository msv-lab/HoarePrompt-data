The code snippet defines a set named `months_with_30_days` that contains the months with 30 days, specifically the integers 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), and 11 (November). The variable `month` holds an integer value between 1 and 12, inclusive, but its value remains unchanged by the code. 

The impact of this code is that a new variable, `months_with_30_days`, has been created, but no calculations or changes were made to the existing variables. The output state should reflect this new variable's definition.

Output State: **`month` is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive; `months_with_30_days` is the set {4, 6, 9, 11}.**
