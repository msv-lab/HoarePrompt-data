To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to check if it accurately determines whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that contains 30 days.

The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the month is in the set of months with 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function returns `True` if the month is in this set, otherwise `False`.

Upon reviewing the provided assertions:
- `func_1(6)` should return `True` because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` should return `False` because February typically has 28 or 29 days.
- `func_1(12)` should return `False` because December has 31 days.

However, there is an issue with the assertions. Specifically:
- The assertion `assert func_1(12) == False` is incorrect since December does indeed have 31 days, and it returns `False` as expected.
- The assertion `func_1(2) == False` is also correct under normal circumstances; however, it doesn't account for leap years (February can have 29 days).

Moreover, we need to consider the edge cases:
1. Months not mentioned in the set should return `False`, which is correctly handled.
2. There are months (such as February) that sometimes creates confusion as it has 28 or 29 days, leading to potential misunderstandings about whether it has "30 days."

Given these considerations, the program fails to verify the accuracy of the month inputs since it does not handle the logic for February properly when considering its alternate days (28 or 29).

Thus, we conclude that the program does not fully meet the requirements as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
