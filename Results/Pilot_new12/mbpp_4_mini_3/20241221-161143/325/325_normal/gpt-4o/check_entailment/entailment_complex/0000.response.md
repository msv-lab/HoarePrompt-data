Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement from the problem description. Specifically, the problem states that the function should check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) has 30 days. However, upon reviewing the implementation in the function `func_1`, the following is observed:

1. The function only checks if the month is one of the specific months that have 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

2. However, the problem description requires the function to return `True` for months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November) and `False` for those that do not, which would also mean it needs to specifically return `True` for inputs like `4` and `6`, and `False` for `2` (February), `1` (January), `3` (March), `5` (May), `7` (July), `8` (August), `10` (October), `11` (November), and `12` (December).

3. The assertions in the code suggest that the interpretation of the results is confused; for instance:
   - `assert func_1(6) == True`: (Correct)
   - `assert func_1(2) == False`: (Correct as February traditionally has 28 or 29 days)
   - `assert func_1(12) == False`: (Incorrect as December has 31 days)

The function returns `True` when the month is one of the months that has 30 days but does not account for the other months correctly, particularly not returning `True` for the months with **31 days** or `False` as needed.

Thus, the implementation does not clearly and completely meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is that it should only indicate whether a month has 30 days or not, including proper handling or output for all months.
