Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given month (represented as an integer from 1 to 12) contains 30 days by checking if the month is one of April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11). The assertions given in the code also align with the expected outputs for those specific month numbers tested: June should return `True` (30 days), while February (2) and December (12) should return `False` (not 30 days). 

However, the function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., months outside the range of 1 to 12). For such cases, the behavior is undefined because the prompt instructs to check if the month number contains 30 days, but it does not specify behavior for invalid inputs. Although we assume valid inputs will be provided, the absence of explicit handling for edge cases such as the boundary values (e.g., 0 and 13) makes it a point of concern.

Hence, since the function does not provide correct and defined output for all potential cases, Correctness: **False**.
