Correctness: **False**

The program has the correct logic for checking whether the given month number corresponds to a month with 30 days (April, June, September, November). However, it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function does not return a correct result or meaningful output for inputs outside the range of 1 to 12. For instance, if we input month number 13, the function will incorrectly return `False`, while it's not even a valid month. Additionally, the function will also yield incorrect behavior for negative values or zero. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
