Correctness: **False**.

The program only checks if the given month number is in the set of months that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November). However, it incorrectly asserts that February (month 2) contains 30 days. According to the provided problem description, the function must indicate whether a specific month contains 30 days or not. The correct returns for month numbers should be:

- 4 (April): True
- 6 (June): True
- 9 (September): True
- 11 (November): True
- 1 (January): False
- 2 (February): False
- 3 (March): False
- 5 (May): False
- 7 (July): False
- 8 (August): False
- 10 (October): False
- 12 (December): False 

Thus, the program fails to handle months that do not have 30 days as required, including months like January, March, May, July, August, October, December, and returning incorrect results.
