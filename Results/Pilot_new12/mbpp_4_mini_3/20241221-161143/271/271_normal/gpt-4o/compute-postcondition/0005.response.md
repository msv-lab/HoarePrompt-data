The variable `avg` is appended to the `averages` list. The value of `avg` is previously calculated as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, where `elements_at_position` is a list of the 0th elements from each tuple in `tuples`, and `len(tuples)` is guaranteed to be greater than 0 (since `num_elements` is greater than 0). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the addition of `avg` to the `averages` list.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple; `num_elements` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `elements_at_position` is a list of the 0th elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` is now extended by `avg`.**
