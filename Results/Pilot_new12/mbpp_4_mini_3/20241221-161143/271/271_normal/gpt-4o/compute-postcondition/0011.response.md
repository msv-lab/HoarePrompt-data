The code snippet creates a new list `elements_at_position`, which extracts the element at index `i` from each tuple in `tuples`. Given that `i` is equal to 2, `elements_at_position` will be populated with the third element of each tuple in `tuples`. The state of the other variables remains the same, with `num_elements` still greater than 2, `avg` still defined as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` including the previous value of `avg`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple; `num_elements` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `elements_at_position` is a list of the 3rd elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`; and `averages` now includes an additional value `avg`.**
