`avg` is assigned the value of `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`. Since `elements_at_position` is a list containing the 1st elements from each tuple in `tuples`, the sum of those elements divided by the number of tuples will yield a numerical average. The variable `averages` is mentioned as being extended by `avg`, but this specific update is not represented in the code snippet provided. Therefore, we will only reflect the updated value of `avg`. 

Thus, the output state is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `num_elements` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the 1st elements from each tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is now equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `num_elements` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the 1st elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
