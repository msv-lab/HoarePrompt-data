The value of `avg` is being recalculated as the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. The previous value of `avg` is now being updated based on the current data. The states of the other variables are not affected, provided that `elements_at_position` is a list of the 3rd elements from each tuple in `tuples`, and `len(tuples)` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple; `num_elements` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `elements_at_position` is a list of the 3rd elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is updated to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`; and `averages` now includes an additional value `avg`.**
