According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `num_elements`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `num_elements`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `num_elements` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `num_elements` must be greater than 2.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `num_elements` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list of the 1st elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` now includes an additional value `avg`.**
