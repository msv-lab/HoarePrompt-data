According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_elements` variable. The loop will only execute if `num_elements` is greater than 0. Given that `num_elements` is equal to the length of `tuples[0]`, this means that `tuples` must have at least one tuple, and that tuple must not be empty for `num_elements` to be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `num_elements - 1`.

To ensure that the loop can execute, the necessary conditions are as follows: `tuples` must contain at least one tuple, the first tuple in `tuples` must contain at least one element, and `i` should start from 0.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
