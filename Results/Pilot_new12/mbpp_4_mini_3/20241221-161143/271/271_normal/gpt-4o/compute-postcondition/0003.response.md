The variable `elements_at_position` is assigned a list comprehension that gathers the `i`th elements from each tuple in the `tuples`. Since `num_elements` is greater than 0, it implies that each tuple in `tuples` has at least one element, and thus `t[i]` is valid for all `t` in `tuples`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the states of `tuples` and `num_elements` also remain unaffected.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0; `elements_at_position` is a list of the 0th elements from each tuple in `tuples`.**
