The code initializes an empty list `averages`. It does not affect the variable `tuples`, which remains a tuple of tuples, and `num_elements`, which is equal to the length of `tuples[0]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `averages` has been initialized as an empty list while retaining the previous values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` is equal to the length of `tuples[0]`, `averages` is an empty list.**
