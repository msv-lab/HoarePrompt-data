The variable `elements_at_position` is assigned the list comprehension `[t[i] for t in tuples]`, where `t` is each tuple in `tuples`, and `i` is 1. This means that `elements_at_position` will now contain the second element (index 1) of each tuple in `tuples`. The previous values of the affected variables are not stated, but we know that `tuples` contains at least one tuple, and `num_elements` is greater than 1. The other variables are not affected, so the output state's details are focused on `elements_at_position`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `num_elements` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list of the 1st elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and `averages` is now extended by `avg`.**
