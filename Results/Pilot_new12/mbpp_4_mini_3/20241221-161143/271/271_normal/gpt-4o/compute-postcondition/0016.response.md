The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, and each inner tuple contains numerical values. After executing the function body, the program returns a list named 'averages' which contains the average of each column of elements from the tuple 'tuples', provided that 'tuples' contains at least one inner tuple. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numerical values and return a list of averages for each column of those inner tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples, which is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values, and returns a list of averages for each column of those inner tuples.**
