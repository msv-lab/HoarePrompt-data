The variable `avg` is assigned the value of the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`. Since `num_elements` is greater than 0, `len(tuples)` is also greater than 0, ensuring that the division is valid. The specific calculation for `avg` will depend on the sum of the elements at position 0 in each tuple contained in `tuples`.

The values of the variables that are not directly affected remain valid. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value for `avg` and retains the relevant information about the remaining variables.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple; `num_elements` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `elements_at_position` is a list of the 0th elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
