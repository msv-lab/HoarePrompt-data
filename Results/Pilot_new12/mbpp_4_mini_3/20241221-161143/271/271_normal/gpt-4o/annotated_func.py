    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `num_elements` is equal to the number of elements in each tuple in `tuples`, `averages` is a list containing the average of each column of elements from `tuples`, and `i` is equal to `num_elements - 1` in the final iteration.
    return averages
    #The program returns the list 'averages' which contains the average of each column of elements from the tuple 'tuples' that contains at least one tuple, with 'num_elements' indicating the number of elements in each tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples that must contain at least one inner tuple, each consisting of numerical values. It calculates the average for each column across the inner tuples and returns a list of these averages. The function assumes that all inner tuples have the same number of elements; if this assumption is violated, it could lead to an IndexError. The resulting list of averages corresponds to the numerical average of the first, second, etc., columns from the provided tuples.
