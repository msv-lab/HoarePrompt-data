Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified that the program may lead to an `IndexError` if the input tuples are not guaranteed to be of the same length. Although the annotations state that the input `tuples` is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values, they do not address the fundamental assumption that all inner tuples are of uniform length through all function calls. This inconsistency remains a potential source of runtime errors that the code does not handle. Therefore, the program does not fully align with the problem description because it does not consider input tuples of varying lengths. Thus, the initial conclusion that the program lacks robustness is accurate, and the final assessment of the program's correctness should remain **False**.
