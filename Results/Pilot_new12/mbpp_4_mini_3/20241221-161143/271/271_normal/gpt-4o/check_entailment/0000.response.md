To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it based on the problem description.

### Problem Description
We need a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.

### Provided Program
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        averages.append(avg)
    return averages
```

### Examining the Code

1. The program calculates the number of elements per tuple using `len(tuples[0])`, assuming that all tuples have the same length. This could lead to issues if the tuples have different lengths.
2. The code iterates through each position (`i`) and retrieves the corresponding elements from each tuple. It then computes the average.
3. The average is calculated using the total sum of elements at that position divided by the number of tuples (`len(tuples)`).

### Potential Issue
- If the input tuples are not guaranteed to be of the same length, the program will throw an `IndexError` when it tries to access an index that does not exist in shorter tuples.
- For instance, the input `func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))` would raise an error since the first tuple has 2 elements but the second has 3.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not handle cases where the tuples might not be of the same length, it does not comply with the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
