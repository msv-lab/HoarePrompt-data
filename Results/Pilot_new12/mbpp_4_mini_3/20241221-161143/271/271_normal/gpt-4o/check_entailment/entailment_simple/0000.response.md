Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a tuple of tuples (as required), and it is assumed that the input will always be valid (i.e., it will contain at least one tuple and all tuples have the same number of elements).

2. **Calculation of Averages**: The function correctly calculates the average for each position (index) across the input tuples:
   - It determines the number of elements in each inner tuple (`num_elements`).
   - It iterates over each position, collects all relevant elements at that position across the tuples, computes their sum, and divides by the number of tuples to find the average.

3. **Output Structure**: The function returns a list that contains the average values as specified.

The provided assertions in the annotated program confirm that the function returns the expected results for various test cases, demonstrating that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Thus, the function `func_1` meets the problem requirements by correctly computing the averages of corresponding tuple values, which makes it a valid implementation according to the provided specification.
