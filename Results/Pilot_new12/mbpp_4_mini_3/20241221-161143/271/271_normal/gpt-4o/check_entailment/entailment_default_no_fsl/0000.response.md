Correctness: **False**

The program assumes that all inner tuples have the same number of elements and directly accesses `t[i]` based on the index `i`, which can lead to an IndexError if the inner tuples have different lengths. For example, if the input is `((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`, this would cause an error since the first tuple has 2 elements and the second tuple has 3. Thus, the program does not handle the potential edge case of uneven tuple lengths, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
