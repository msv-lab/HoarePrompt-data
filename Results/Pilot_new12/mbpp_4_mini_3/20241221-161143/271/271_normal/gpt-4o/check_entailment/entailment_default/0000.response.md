The provided function `func_1` computes the average for each position across tuples, which seems consistent with the problem description. The output hints also indicate that it generates averages for each corresponding index across the tuples.

The key points to evaluate are:

1. **Assumption about Inner Tuple Lengths:** The code assumes all inner tuples will have the same length. If this condition is not met, the code will raise an `IndexError`. The hints confirm that this assumption is crucial for the function's accuracy.

2. **Valid Input Requirement:** The problem description does not specify input constraints, but we assume that valid tuples of numbers will be provided as inputs, which means we are not considering the error handling for irregular inputs, such as varying inner tuple lengths or empty tuples.

3. **Functionality:** The code iterates over the range of the length of the first inner tuple and averages each respective index correctly, which aligns with the problem goal.

Given that the function is structured to handle valid input and does what the description specifies, we find that it meets the requirements. Thus, based on the assumptions made regarding the input, it does indeed correctly compute the averages.

Correctness: **True**.
