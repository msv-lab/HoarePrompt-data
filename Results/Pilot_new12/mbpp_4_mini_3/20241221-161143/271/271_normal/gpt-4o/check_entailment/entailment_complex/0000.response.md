Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown explaining why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples containing numerical values. The problem description indicates this structure, and the program adheres to it.

2. **Calculation of Averages**: 
   - The function calculates the number of elements in the first tuple (`num_elements`) to determine how many positions need to be averaged.
   - It iterates over the range of `num_elements`, and for each index `i`, it constructs a list of elements at that position from each inner tuple using a list comprehension: `[t[i] for t in tuples]`.
   - The average is then calculated correctly as `avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, which computes the mean for that position across all tuples.

3. **Returning Results**: The calculated averages for each position are stored in the list `averages`, which is then returned. This directly fulfills the specification of returning a list of averages corresponding to the values from each tuple position.

4. **Consistency with Problem Description**: 
   - The function does not make any assumptions about the integrity of the input beyond what is stipulated (i.e., valid input format). However, it is guaranteed under the assumptions that the input will always be valid. This means it will not encounter issues such as differing tuple lengths.
   - Therefore, the function will consistently produce the expected results as described in the problem statement.

In conclusion, since the program meets all requirements of the problem description and has been tested with relevant assertions confirming its correctness, we conclude that it is adequately implemented to always produce the correct outputs for valid inputs.
