The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples that must contain at least one inner tuple, each consisting of numerical values. It calculates the average for each column across the inner tuples and returns a list of these averages. The function assumes that all inner tuples have the same number of elements; if this assumption is violated, it could lead to an IndexError. The resulting list of averages corresponds to the numerical average of the first, second, etc., columns from the provided tuples.
