Correctness: **False**. 

The implementation does not correctly handle the case when the input `tuples` is empty or when any of the inner tuples are empty, which would lead to a `ZeroDivisionError`. For example, if the input is an empty tuple `()`, the program would attempt to calculate the average with zero elements, which is not permissible. Additionally, if any of the inner tuples are empty (e.g., `((1, 2), ())`), it would also cause a division by zero since there would be no values to average. Therefore, the program fails to satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
