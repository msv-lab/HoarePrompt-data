Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single argument `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples. This aligns with the problem description's requirement.

2. **Computation of Averages**:
   - The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to unpack the tuples and group the corresponding elements together. This means that for each position in the inner tuples, corresponding values are grouped together.
   - It then computes the average for each group using `sum(val) / len(tuples)`. Here, `sum(val)` calculates the total of the grouped values, and `len(tuples)` provides the number of inner tuples, which is used to compute the average.

3. **Output**: The function returns a list where each element is the average of corresponding values from each tuple, precisely as specified in the problem description.

Overall, since the function correctly implements the requirements of the problem and computes the desired averages without any errors under the assumed valid input, it is deemed correct.
