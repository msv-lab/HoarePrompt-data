Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function appears to be trying to compute the averages of corresponding values from a tuple of tuples. The approach using `zip` and list comprehension correctly computes the averages under the assumption that `tuples` is both non-empty and that all inner tuples contain valid numerical values. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle potential edge cases, such as an empty `tuples` or any empty inner tuples. If `tuples` is empty, the call to `len(tuples)` results in a division by zero, leading to a `ZeroDivisionError`. Consequently, the function does not fulfill the problem description for all potential cases, specifically when handling edge cases.
