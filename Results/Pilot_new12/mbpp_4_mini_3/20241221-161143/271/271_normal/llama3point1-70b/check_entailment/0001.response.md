To verify the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to examine the function's behavior for various potential cases, including edge cases.

### Problem description:
The requirements are to:
- Take a tuple of tuples.
- Return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Function Logic**: 
   The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to group elements from each tuple by their index positions, effectively creating a new tuple for each index position. It then calculates the sum of these grouped values and divides by the number of tuples to find the average.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Input**: If the input is an empty tuple of tuples (e.g., `()`). The program will produce a `ZeroDivisionError` when trying to calculate `sum(val) / len(tuples)` because `len(tuples)` would be 0.
   - **Unequal Length Tuples**: If the tuples within the tuple have different lengths, using `zip` will truncate the longest tuple to the length of the shortest one, which may not yield valid averages corresponding to the original problem statement.

### Testing the Edge Cases:
- For an empty input: 
  ```python
  func_1(())  # raises ZeroDivisionError
  ```
- For tuples of different lengths:
  ```python
  func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))  # This results in [(1+3)/2] => [2] but ignores the third element of the second tuple
  ```

Both of these test cases reveal that the function does not handle certain scenarios correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the derived issues with the handling of empty inputs and tuples of unequal lengths, the program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
