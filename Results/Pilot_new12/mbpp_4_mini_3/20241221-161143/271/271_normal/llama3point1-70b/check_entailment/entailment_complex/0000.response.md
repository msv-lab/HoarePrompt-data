Correctness: **False**

The program does not entirely meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly computes the averages of corresponding values across tuples, it lacks handling for edge cases. Specifically, if the input is an empty tuple or if any of the inner tuples is empty, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` due to division by zero. The problem description does not specify that the input will always be valid; thus the function might not behave correctly for all potential inputs, contradicting the requirement to handle cases appropriately. Therefore, it does not fully align with the problem description as stated.
