Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to handle cases where the input tuples are empty. For example, if the input is an empty tuple of tuples (`()`), the program will attempt to calculate the average of an empty list (resulting from `zip(*tuples)`). This will raise a division by zero error because it tries to compute `sum(val) / len(tuples)` where `len(tuples)` is zero. Thus, there are cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
