#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numerical values.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list containing the average of numerical values for each position across the inner tuples in the 'tuples' variable.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples containing numerical values. It computes and returns a list of averages for each position across the inner tuples. Specifically, the function uses the `zip` function to group the elements by their position and calculates the mean for each group. However, the function does not handle potential edge cases such as when `tuples` is empty or when any of the inner tuples are empty, which could lead to a `ZeroDivisionError`. The final output is a list of averages corresponding to each index across the inner tuples, assuming that the input is valid and follows the expected structure.
