#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
    #The program returns True if the list 'arr' contains duplicate integers, otherwise it returns False, based on the comparison of the length of 'arr' and the length of the set of 'arr' which eliminates duplicates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It checks whether there are any duplicate integers within the list. The function returns True if duplicates are found and False if the list contains only unique integers. The function effectively uses the concept of set conversion to determine uniqueness by comparing the length of the original list with the length of the set created from that list. Edge cases such as an empty list (which will return False as there are no duplicates) and lists with varying data types (though expected to be integers) are not explicitly handled, but the current implementation will still return an accurate result for any list of hashable elements. In summary, the final state after the function concludes is that it indicates the presence or absence of duplicate integers in the list `arr`.
