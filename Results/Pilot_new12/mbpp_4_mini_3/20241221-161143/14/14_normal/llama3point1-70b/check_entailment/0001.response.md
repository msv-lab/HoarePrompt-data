Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is intended to check if an array of integers contains any duplicate elements. However, its implementation has a logical flaw in relation to the expected output based on the problem description.

The current implementation returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` otherwise, which is the reverse of what we expect. According to the problem description, it should return `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are none.

For example:
- Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3]` (no duplicates)
  - Expected output: `False`
  - Actual output: `True`
  
- Input: `arr = [1, 2, 2]` (has duplicates)
  - Expected output: `True`
  - Actual output: `False`

Thus, the function does not correctly identify the presence of duplicates according to the requirements. Since it fails for multiple potential cases, the correctness is false.
