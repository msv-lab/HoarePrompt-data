Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does reverse checks for duplicates compared to the problem description. According to the requirement, the function should return `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if no duplicates are present. However, the function is implemented to return `True` when duplicates are found (i.e., when `len(arr) != len(set(arr))`), which corresponds to the opposite logic: it returns `True` for duplicates and `False` for unique elements.

The annotated version supports this by explaining that the function indeed determines the presence of duplicates as intended but fails to yield the correct output format as per the problem description's requirement. Thus, the conclusion is that the function does not correctly implement the expected behavior of identifying duplicates in accordance with the specified logic, leading to a final judgment of correctness being **False**.
