Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks for duplicates in an array of integers. It converts the array into a set, which inherently removes duplicates, and then compares the length of the original array with the length of the set. If they differ, it means there was at least one duplicate in the original array. This logic holds for all potential cases, including arrays with no elements, one element, or multiple elements. All edge cases are covered correctly.
