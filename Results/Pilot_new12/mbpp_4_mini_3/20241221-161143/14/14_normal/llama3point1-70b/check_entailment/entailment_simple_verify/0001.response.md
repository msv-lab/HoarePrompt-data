Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly meet the problem description. The function is supposed to check for duplicate integers in the provided list. However, its implementation returns `True` when duplicates are present and `False` when they are not, which is the opposite of what is required. 

As per the annotated version, while it correctly states that the function checks for duplicates by comparing the lengths of the original list and the set of the list, it fails to acknowledge that the return values are inverted in relation to the expected output. 

In summary, the function's logic is flawed: 
- It should return `True` for duplicates and `False` for no duplicates, but it does the opposite. 

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, and the overall assessment remains that the program is incorrect.
