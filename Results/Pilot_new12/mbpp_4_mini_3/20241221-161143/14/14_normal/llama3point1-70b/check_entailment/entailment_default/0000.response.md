The provided function `func_1` takes a list of integers and checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the original list with the length of a set created from the list. The logic outlined in the output hints is consistent with this description. 

The function will return `True` if there are duplicates found in the array (because the set would have a smaller length than the original list), and `False` if all integers are unique. The case of an empty list is correctly handled since the length of both the list and the set would be zero, thus returning `False`.

However, an edge case that must be carefully considered is that the function may not handle lists where elements are not integers (though the problem explicitly states that the input should be a list of integers). The function inherently relies on the properties of sets, which require hashable items, meaning that if any non-integer element were included (e.g., a float or string), it could behave unexpectedly. 

Yet, based on the problem description which assumes valid input (list of integers), the function itself will accurately determine if duplicates exist under the constraints provided.

Therefore, since the function performs correctly for the described purpose and expected valid inputs, it meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
