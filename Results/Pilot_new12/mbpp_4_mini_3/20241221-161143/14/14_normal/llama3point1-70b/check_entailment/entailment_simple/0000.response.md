Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description because it returns `True` when there are duplicates in the array and `False` when there are no duplicates. The problem description requires a function that determines whether any duplicate elements exist. However, in typical convention, one would expect a function formatted to return `True` for the presence of duplicates and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the function's return values are misleading, which means that the program does not correctly align with the requirement outlined in the problem description.
