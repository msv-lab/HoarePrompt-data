Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program functions as intended according to the problem description. The function `func_1(arr)` effectively checks for duplicates in a list of integers by comparing the length of the original list with the length of the set created from that list. The annotations confirm that the logic of the program is sound and that it handles edge cases appropriately, particularly with its treatment of an empty list. The function will return `True` for lists containing duplicates and `False` for lists with all unique integers, aligning perfectly with the requirements laid out in the problem description. There are no discrepancies between the annotated explanation and the original assessment, which underscores the accuracy of the assessment.
