Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. It defines the function `func_1`, which takes a list of integers and checks for duplicates within that list. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Checking for Duplicates**: The function uses a set called `seen` to keep track of integers that have already been encountered. As it iterates over the list, it checks if each number is already in the `seen` set.
2. **Return Value**: 
   - If a number is found in the `seen` set during the iteration, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that there is a duplicate.
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`, indicating all integers are unique.
3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The function handles edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element by returning `False`, as there would be no duplicates in such scenarios.
4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided serve as test cases that confirm the function behaves correctly under various inputsâ€”returning `False` for unique elements and `True` for cases with duplicates.

All of these points ensure that `func_1` fulfills the requirements of the problem description by correctly identifying whether duplicates exist in the provided array of integers. Thus, the function is indeed correct as it meets the objective set out in the problem statement.
