Correctness: **False**

The program's logic for checking duplicates in an integer array is correct and efficiently utilizes a set to maintain seen integers. However, it does not handle the case where the input is not a list type, which can lead to unintended behavior. The output hints confirm that the program checks for duplicate values within a list of integers, but they also indicate that the function does not perform input type validation.

For example, if the function is called with a non-list type, such as a string or a dictionary, the logic will fail. Here's a case illustrating this issue:

```python
func_1("not a list")
```

The above input would raise an error or lead to incorrect processing because the function does not expect a string but treats it as iterable, potentially misbehaving without producing a clear output. Therefore, since the function does not meet the problem description for every potential case, it is deemed incorrect.
