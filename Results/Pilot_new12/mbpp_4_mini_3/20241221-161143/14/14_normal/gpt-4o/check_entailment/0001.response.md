Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly determines whether an array of integers contains any duplicate elements. Here's why the function works correctly for the given problem description:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of the integers that have been encountered.

2. **Iteration**: As it iterates over each number in the input array, it checks if the number is already present in the `seen` set.

3. **Duplicate Detection**: 
   - If a number is found in `seen`, this indicates a duplicate, and the function immediately returns `True`.
   - If the number is not in `seen`, it adds the number to the set.

4. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns `False`.

The function has been tested with diverse cases:
- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `False` (no duplicates).
- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]` returns `True` (duplicate of `4`).
- `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]` returns `True` (duplicates of `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`).

It also handles edge cases effectively, such as:
- An empty array `[]` returns `False`, as there can't be duplicates in an empty array.
- An array with a single element `[1]` also returns `False`.

No additional edge case or input scenario has been identified where the function fails to meet the requirements as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct and fully satisfies the requirements.
