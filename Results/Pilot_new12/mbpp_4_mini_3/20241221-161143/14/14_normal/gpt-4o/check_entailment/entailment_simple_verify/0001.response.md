Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate as the `func_1` implementation correctly meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to determine if there are any duplicate elements in a given array of integers. The annotations provided further illustrate the program's logic and state, confirming that:

1. The function initializes a set `seen` to track unique integers and iterates through the input list.
2. The logic checks for duplicates effectively and returns `True` upon encountering any.
3. If no duplicates are found during the iteration, the function correctly returns `False`.

The function was validated with multiple test cases, all of which returned expected results, and the annotations corroborate the correctness of both the logic and state at critical points in the code. This reinforces the conclusion that the function operates as intended under the given problem constraints.
