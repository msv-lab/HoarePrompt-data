Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description by effectively determining whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. 

The reasoning is supported by the output hints, which confirm the functionality as follows:

1. **Functionality**: The function correctly uses a set to track seen integers and returns `True` upon finding the first duplicate, or `False` if no duplicates exist after iterating through the list.

2. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions confirm that the function produces the expected results for various input cases, including those with no duplicates, single duplicates, and multiple duplicates.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function appropriately handles edge cases where the input array may be empty or contain a single element, ensuring that it returns `False` in such scenarios.

The output hints indicate that the function does not perform input validation, which aligns with the assumption that valid inputs (lists of integers) will always be provided. Thus, this does not detract from the correctness of the implementation regarding the problem it is meant to solve.

Therefore, after careful consideration of the provided information and the original assessment, the conclusion remains that the program operates correctly as per the stated requirements.
