Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether the given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. It does so by utilizing a set to keep track of seen numbers. Here's why the code is correct:

1. For each number in the input array, the function checks if it has already been seen (i.e., if it exists in the `seen` set).
2. If a number is found in the `seen` set, it immediately returns `True`, indicating a duplicate exists.
3. If no duplicates are found by the end of the loop, the function returns `False`.

The assertions provided in the program show that it returns the expected results for the given test cases. Specifically:

- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, there are no duplicates, and the function correctly returns `False`.
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, the number `4` appears twice, so the function correctly returns `True`.
- For the input `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, multiple duplicates exist, and the function correctly returns `True`.

As it passes all the provided test cases and handles potential edge cases, such as empty arrays or arrays with unique elements, the implementation can be deemed correct.
