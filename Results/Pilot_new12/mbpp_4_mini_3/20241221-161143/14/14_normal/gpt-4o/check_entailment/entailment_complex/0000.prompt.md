You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        
        seen.add(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set of integers containing all unique integers from `arr`. If there are no duplicates in `arr`, the loop will complete without returning, and `seen` will contain all integers from `arr`. If there are duplicates, the function will return `True` during the iteration for the first duplicate found.
    return False
    #The program returns False indicating that there were no duplicates found in the list 'arr', and 'seen' contains all unique integers from 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for duplicate values within that list. It maintains a set `seen` to keep track of the integers that have already been encountered. If a duplicate integer is found during the iteration through `arr`, the function immediately returns `True`. If the iteration completes without finding duplicates, the function returns `False`, indicating that all integers in `arr` are unique. Additionally, it handles edge cases where `arr` may be empty or contain only one element by returning `False`, as no duplicates can exist in such scenarios. The function does not perform any validation on the input type, meaning that passing a non-list type would not raise an error but would instead lead to unintended behavior.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
