#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        
        seen.add(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set of integers containing all unique integers from `arr`. If there are no duplicates in `arr`, the loop will complete without returning, and `seen` will contain all integers from `arr`. If there are duplicates, the function will return `True` during the iteration for the first duplicate found.
    return False
    #The program returns False indicating that there were no duplicates found in the list 'arr', and 'seen' contains all unique integers from 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for duplicate values within that list. It maintains a set `seen` to keep track of the integers that have already been encountered. If a duplicate integer is found during the iteration through `arr`, the function immediately returns `True`. If the iteration completes without finding duplicates, the function returns `False`, indicating that all integers in `arr` are unique. Additionally, it handles edge cases where `arr` may be empty or contain only one element by returning `False`, as no duplicates can exist in such scenarios. The function does not perform any validation on the input type, meaning that passing a non-list type would not raise an error but would instead lead to unintended behavior.
