The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for duplicate values within that list. It maintains a set `seen` to keep track of the integers that have already been encountered. If a duplicate integer is found during the iteration through `arr`, the function immediately returns `True`. If the iteration completes without finding duplicates, the function returns `False`, indicating that all integers in `arr` are unique. Additionally, it handles edge cases where `arr` may be empty or contain only one element by returning `False`, as no duplicates can exist in such scenarios. The function does not perform any validation on the input type, meaning that passing a non-list type would not raise an error but would instead lead to unintended behavior.
