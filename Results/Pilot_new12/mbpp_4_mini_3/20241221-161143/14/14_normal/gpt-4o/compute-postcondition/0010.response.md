According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 integers, the loop will execute for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `arr`, and `seen` still contains `num` unchanged. For the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 integers, and `num` should be the third integer in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers containing at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in `arr`, `seen` is still a set containing `num` with no change in contents.**
