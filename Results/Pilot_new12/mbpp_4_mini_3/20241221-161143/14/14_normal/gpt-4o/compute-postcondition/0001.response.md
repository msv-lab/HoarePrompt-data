According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Since `seen` is an empty set, it doesn't affect the execution of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `num` will be the last integer in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list must have at least 1 integer, and `num` should be the first integer in `arr` during the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `arr`, `seen` is an empty set**
