According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more integers in `arr` to iterate over. Since `num` is initialized to the first integer in `arr`, and `seen` contains `num`, we need to consider what happens after the end of the last iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer, and since we are iterating through `arr`, we can expect that `num` will take on the next integer in the list at the start of the next iteration.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have another integer available for `num` to take, which means `num` will need to be set to the next integer in the list. Since the loop is iterating through all integers in the list, if there are at least 2 integers in `arr`, the next value for `num` would be the second integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that contains at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `arr`, `seen` is a set containing `num`.**
