The code line `seen.add(num)` adds `num` to the set `seen`. Given that `num` is the second integer in the list `arr`, and `seen` initially contains `num`, the addition will not change the contents of `seen` if it already contains `num`. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers containing at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in `arr`, and `seen` is still a set containing `num` with no change in contents.**
