The `seen` set adds the value of `num` to it. Given that `num` is the first integer in `arr` and is not in `seen`, the state of `seen` will now include `num`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that contains at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in `arr`, `seen` is a set containing `num`.**
