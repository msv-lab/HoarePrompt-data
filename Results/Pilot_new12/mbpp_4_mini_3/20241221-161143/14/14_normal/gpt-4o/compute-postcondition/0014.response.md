Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is a set of integers containing all unique integers from `arr`. If there are no duplicates in `arr`, the loop will complete without returning, and `seen` will contain all integers from `arr`. If there are duplicates, the function will return `True` during the iteration for the first duplicate found.**
