#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers containing at least 6 integers, the function returns True if all elements at odd indices of `lst` are odd integers. If any element at an odd index is even, the function returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements at odd indices of the list 'lst' are odd integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It iterates through the elements of the list at all odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.) and checks if any of these elements are even. If an even element is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`. If all elements at odd indices are confirmed to be odd integers, the function returns `True`. It must be noted that the function does not handle cases where the input list has fewer than 6 elements, as the postconditions assume it does. There is also no handling for non-integer types within the list, which could lead to errors when performing the modulus operation. Overall, the final state indicates whether all odd-indexed elements in the list are odd integers, returning `True` or `False` accordingly.
