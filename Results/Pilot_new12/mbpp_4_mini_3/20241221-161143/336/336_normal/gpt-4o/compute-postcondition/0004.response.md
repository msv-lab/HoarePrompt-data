According to the code, the loop iterates through the list `lst` starting from index 1, incrementing by 2 in each iteration. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(lst)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means it is currently referencing the second element of `lst`, and `lst` has at least 2 integers. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next odd index, which would be 3. For `i` to be 3, `lst` must have at least 4 integers.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `i` is 3, and the element at index `i` of `lst` is an odd integer.**
