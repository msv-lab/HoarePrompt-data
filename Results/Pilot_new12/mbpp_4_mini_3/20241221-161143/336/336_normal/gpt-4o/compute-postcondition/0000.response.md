According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. The `range` function starts from 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches the length of `lst`. For the loop to execute, `lst` must have a length of at least 2, as the starting index is 1 and the increment is by 2. After the last iteration, the value of `i` would be the last odd index, which is dependent on the length of the list. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 2 integers, and `i` initially is 1 (the first odd index).

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
