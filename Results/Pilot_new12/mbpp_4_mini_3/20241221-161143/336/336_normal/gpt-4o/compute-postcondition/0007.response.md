According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from 1 to the length of `lst`, incrementing `i` by 2, which means `i` takes odd values. The current value of `i` is 3. At the end of the last iteration, since `lst` contains at least 4 integers, it can continue executing the loop.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be increased by 2. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 5. Furthermore, for the loop to execute again, the length of `lst` must be at least 6 (so that index 5 exists). 

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers containing at least 6 integers, and `i` is 5**.
