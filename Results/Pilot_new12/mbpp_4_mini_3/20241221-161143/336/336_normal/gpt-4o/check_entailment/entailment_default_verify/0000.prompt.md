You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is supposed to check whether every odd index of the provided list contains odd numbers. However, there is an issue with the condition specified in the assertion examples. 

The test case `func_1([4, 1, 2])` is expected to return `True`, but in that list, index `1` (which has the value `1`, an odd number) and index `2` (which has the value `2`, an even number) does not fall under the checking condition since `2` is at an even index. Therefore, according to the requirement, the result should check only the odd indices, and thus should return `True`. 

Additionally, the function iterates over the list starting from index `1` and checks if the values at these indices are odd. The problem comes when considering an empty list or lists of a single element. 

For instance, calling `func_1([])` or `func_1([2])` are edge cases not handled by the code. Since thereâ€™s no indication of what the expected behavior is for such cases, the code fails to provide definitive behavior for all possible inputs. 

Therefore, since there are cases where the function does not meet the requirements, the correctness is labeled as **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It iterates through the elements of the list at all odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.) and checks if any of these elements are even. If an even element is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`. If all elements at odd indices are confirmed to be odd integers, the function returns `True`. It must be noted that the function does not handle cases where the input list has fewer than 6 elements, as the postconditions assume it does. There is also no handling for non-integer types within the list, which could lead to errors when performing the modulus operation. Overall, the final state indicates whether all odd-indexed elements in the list are odd integers, returning `True` or `False` accordingly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
