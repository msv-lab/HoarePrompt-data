Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, while the function checks if every odd index in the list contains odd numbers, it assumes that the input list will always have at least 6 elements. However, the problem does not specify a minimum length for the list, meaning it is possible for the function to be called with lists of varying lengths, including those with fewer than 6 elements.

For example, consider the input list `[2, 1]`. The function would correctly check the single odd index (1) and find an odd number (1), thus returning `True`. However, based on the output hints, it suggests that the function does not handle lists shorter than 6 elements as expected. Additionally, it does not account for cases with non-integer types, which could lead to errors.

Since the function does not properly handle these cases, it fails to provide the correct output for every potential input scenario.
