The original assessment of the program's correctness is labeled as **False**. This judgment was primarily based on the incorrectness of the second test case, `func_1([4, 1, 2])`, which the original assessment argued was expected to return `True`, pointing to the odd value at an odd index but ignoring the fact that the check is correctly implemented only on the odd indices.

However, the program does meet the problem description and functions as intended. The function iterates through the elements of the list at odd indices and correctly checks if those values are all odd. 

1. The first test case `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True` as expected because at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) the values are (1, 3, 7, 3), all of which are odd integers.

2. The second test case `func_1([4, 1, 2])` should be assessed accurately. The odd index is 1, where the value is `1` (odd), and the index `2` is not checked because the function only evaluates odd indices. Therefore, this returns `True`, which is correct according to the program logic.

3. The third test case `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False`, correctly reflecting that the value at odd index `1` is `2`, which is even.

The argument made in the original assessment regarding edge cases such as empty lists or lists with only one element is not justified appropriately since the problem description assumes we will always provide valid inputs. The hints clarify that the functionality corresponds exactly with the stated purpose of the function. 

Considering this analysis, the original assessment lacks foundation. Therefore, the program behaves correctly according to the problem description and the functionality stated in the output hints. 

Final: **True**
