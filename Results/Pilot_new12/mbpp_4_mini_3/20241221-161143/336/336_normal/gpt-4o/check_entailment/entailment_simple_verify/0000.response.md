The function `func_1` is indeed designed to check whether every odd index in the input list contains an odd number. Upon analyzing the annotated code and its states closely, we can summarize the findings:

1. The function iterates over the odd indices of the list (`1, 3, 5, ...`) and checks if the values at these indices are even. If an even number is found, it returns `False`.

2. The relevant test cases:
   - `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])`: The value at index `1` (which is `1`, an odd number) is valid, while index `3` (which is `3`, also odd) is valid, and the function correctly returns `True`.
   - `func_1([4, 1, 2])`: The value at index `1` (which is `1`, an odd number) passes. Index `2` is even, but since the checks are only against odd indices, it returns `True` correctly here as well.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3])`: The value at index `1` (which is `2`, an even number) fails the check immediately, returning `False` as expected.

3. The original assessment labeled the correctness as **False**, arguing that the function might fail to handle edge cases like an empty list or lists with a single element. However, given the assumption of valid inputs (as stated in the task), the program is functioning correctly for the defined input conditions, only needing to evaluate the odd indices.

The final assessment is based on the fact that the function achieves its intended purpose accurately for valid inputs and handles the test cases as expected.

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations supports the claims made:

Final: **True**
