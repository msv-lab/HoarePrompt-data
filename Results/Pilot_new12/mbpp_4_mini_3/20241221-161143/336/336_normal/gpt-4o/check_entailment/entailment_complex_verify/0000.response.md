Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not behave as intended when evaluated against the problem description. The purpose of the function is to check whether every odd index in the given list contains odd numbers. However, the statement in the assessment regarding the condition for `func_1([4, 1, 2])` illustrates that the output can be misleading.

In this test case, the list `[4, 1, 2]` has an odd index `1` (which contains `1`, an odd number), and index `2` (even index) is not considered. The function should hypothetically return `True`, but it is incorrectly interpreted in the reasoning as correct behavior. Furthermore, the assessment notes that the function lacks handling for edge cases like an empty list or lists with fewer than 2 elements, which further supports that the function is not robust and doesn't cover the expected behavior in such scenarios.

The core issue is that even if all odd-indexed elements are odd, the program as currently structured does not lead to any assurance of comprehensive correctness when faced with unusual inputs or expected validation processes. Thus, the function fails to meet the broader constraint of reliability mentioned in the original assessment.
