Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is supposed to check whether every odd index of the provided list contains odd numbers. However, there is an issue with the condition specified in the assertion examples. 

The test case `func_1([4, 1, 2])` is expected to return `True`, but in that list, index `1` (which has the value `1`, an odd number) and index `2` (which has the value `2`, an even number) does not fall under the checking condition since `2` is at an even index. Therefore, according to the requirement, the result should check only the odd indices, and thus should return `True`. 

Additionally, the function iterates over the list starting from index `1` and checks if the values at these indices are odd. The problem comes when considering an empty list or lists of a single element. 

For instance, calling `func_1([])` or `func_1([2])` are edge cases not handled by the code. Since thereâ€™s no indication of what the expected behavior is for such cases, the code fails to provide definitive behavior for all possible inputs. 

Therefore, since there are cases where the function does not meet the requirements, the correctness is labeled as **False**.
