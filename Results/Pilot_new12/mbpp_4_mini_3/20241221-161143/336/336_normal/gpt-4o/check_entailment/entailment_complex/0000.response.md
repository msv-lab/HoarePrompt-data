Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to check whether every odd index in a list contains odd numbers. It iterates over the list starting at index 1 (the first odd index) and checks each element at the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).

2. **Checking Conditions**: Within the loop, the program checks if the current element (at an odd index) is even using `lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If an even number is found, it returns `False` immediately, which matches the requirement to return `False` when there is an even number at an odd index.

3. **Returning Result**: If the loop completes and no even numbers have been found at any of the odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd-indexed elements are indeed odd. This aligns perfectly with the requirement stated in the problem.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases for the implementation:
   - The first assertion checks a list with odd indexed values being odd, returning `True`.
   - The second assertion also confirms that a list ending with an odd number at an odd index returns `True`.
   - The third assertion correctly identifies a list where the element at index 1 is even, returning `False`.

5. **Handling of Input**: The program assumes that the input is valid (i.e., a list of integers with at least 6 elements), as stipulated in the description. Since there is no explicit constraint about handling fewer than 6 elements, the program's behavior in such cases aligns with the assumption that input will conform to the expected format.

In conclusion, the program meets all specifications of the problem statement and consistently checks that all elements at odd indices are odd, thus verifying its correctness.
