You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list contains odd numbers. It loops through the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks if the value at each odd index is odd. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. If it finishes the loop without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Indexing**: The function uses the range `range(1, len(lst), 2)`, which correctly targets all odd indices.
2. **Condition Check**: It checks `if lst[i] % 2 == 0`, which properly identifies even numbers. If it detects an even number, it correctly returns `False`.
3. **Returning True**: If no even numbers are found at any of the odd indices, it correctly returns `True`.

### Test Cases:
- For the input `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`, the odd indices are 1 (`1`), 3 (`3`), 5 (`7`), and 7 (`3`). All are odd numbers, so it returns `True`.
- For the input `[4, 1, 2]`, the only odd index is 1 (`1`), which is odd, so it returns `True`.
- For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the odd index is 1 (`2`), which is even, so it correctly returns `False`.

Thus, the logic works for all potential cases and adheres to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It iterates through the elements of the list at all odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.) and checks if any of these elements are even. If an even element is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`. If all elements at odd indices are confirmed to be odd integers, the function returns `True`. It must be noted that the function does not handle cases where the input list has fewer than 6 elements, as the postconditions assume it does. There is also no handling for non-integer types within the list, which could lead to errors when performing the modulus operation. Overall, the final state indicates whether all odd-indexed elements in the list are odd integers, returning `True` or `False` accordingly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
