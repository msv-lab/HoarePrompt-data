Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list contains odd numbers. It loops through the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks if the value at each odd index is odd. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. If it finishes the loop without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Indexing**: The function uses the range `range(1, len(lst), 2)`, which correctly targets all odd indices.
2. **Condition Check**: It checks `if lst[i] % 2 == 0`, which properly identifies even numbers. If it detects an even number, it correctly returns `False`.
3. **Returning True**: If no even numbers are found at any of the odd indices, it correctly returns `True`.

### Test Cases:
- For the input `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`, the odd indices are 1 (`1`), 3 (`3`), 5 (`7`), and 7 (`3`). All are odd numbers, so it returns `True`.
- For the input `[4, 1, 2]`, the only odd index is 1 (`1`), which is odd, so it returns `True`.
- For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the odd index is 1 (`2`), which is even, so it correctly returns `False`.

Thus, the logic works for all potential cases and adheres to the problem description.
