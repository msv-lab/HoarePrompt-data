The function `func_1` checks whether all elements at odd indices of a list are odd integers. It iterates through the list starting from index 1 and checks if any of the corresponding elements are even. If it finds an even element at an odd index, it returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any even elements at odd indices, it returns `True`.

The output hints indicate that the function is designed to return `True` if all odd-indexed elements are odd and `False` otherwise. However, the hints also note that there is no handling for cases where the input list has fewer than 6 elements and do not address potential non-integer types in the list.

In the provided examples:
1. `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True` because the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) have odd values.
2. `func_1([4, 1, 2])` returns `True` because the odd index (1) has the value 1, which is odd.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` because it finds an even number (2) at the odd index (1).

However, the program does not consider other scenarios, such as:
- An input list with fewer than 6 elements, which means that the range for odd indices could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the indices are checked against a non-'minimum size' rule. (Though as mentioned above, we assume input will be valid.)

Despite the output hints indicating these potential issues (such as the lack of handling for non-integers), the principal functionality of checking for odd numbers at odd indices works correctly as intended based on the above test cases.

Since no test case has been provided that conclusively demonstrates failure under valid assumptions within the specification (valid inputs), I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**.
