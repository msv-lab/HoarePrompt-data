According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lst`. If `i` is less than the length of the list (which has at least 1 integer), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Since the value of `i` is even, and we know that the first element `lst[0]` must be an integer from the list, it follows that the loop checks the next index.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the beginning of the next iteration.

Since the list `lst` has at least 1 integer, and at the next iteration `i` will be 1, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst`, which must now be at least 2.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that has at least 2 integers, `i` is 1. The value of `i` is odd, or the value of `lst[i]` is odd.**
