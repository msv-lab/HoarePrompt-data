According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the list `lst`. The loop continues while `i` is less than `len(lst)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `lst` has at least 2 integers. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to increase by 1, making it 2. Therefore, `lst` must have at least 3 integers for the loop to execute again because the current index must still be within the bounds of the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, and `i` is 2**
