According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. The loop will execute if the length of `lst` is at least 1.  At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `len(lst) - 1`. To ensure the loop executes, `lst` must have at least 1 integer, and `i` should initially be equal to 0 during the first iteration. 

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0**
