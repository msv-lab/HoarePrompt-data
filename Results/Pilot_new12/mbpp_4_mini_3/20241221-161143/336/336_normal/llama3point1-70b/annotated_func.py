#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, for every odd index `i`, `lst[i]` is odd or there are no even values at odd indices; `i` is equal to `len(lst)`. If `lst` is empty, then `len(lst)` is 0.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating the condition regarding the list 'lst' and its properties at odd indices is satisfied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `lst` as input and checks the values at the odd indices of the list. It returns `False` if there exists any even integer at an odd index; otherwise, it returns `True`. If the list is empty, it also returns `True`. The function does not alter the input list, maintaining its original state throughout the execution. It effectively ensures that all values at odd indices of the list are either odd, or that there are no even values present at those positions.
