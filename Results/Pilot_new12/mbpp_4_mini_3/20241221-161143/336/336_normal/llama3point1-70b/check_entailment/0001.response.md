To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implemented code.

**Problem Description:** We need a function that checks whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

**Logic Breakdown:**
1. The function iterates through each index of the list `lst`.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
3. If `i` is odd and the element at that index `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), it returns `False`.
4. If no odd index contains an even number, the function returns `True`.

**Testing Edge Cases and Potential Problems:**
1. Let's consider an empty list `[]`. In this case, there are no odd indexes, and the function should return `True`. The program handles this correctly.
   
2. Consider a list with only one element `[2]`. There are no odd indexes; thus, the function should return `True`, which it does.

3. For a list with an odd index element being even, such as `[1, 2, 3]`, the second element (at index 1) is even and the first index (odd) is correctly identified. Hence, the function will return `False`.

4. A case with a list like `[0, 1, 2, 3]`: 
   - Index 0 (even), not checked.
   - Index 1 (odd), contains `1` (odd).
   - Index 2 (even), not checked.
   - Index 3 (odd), contains `3` (odd). 
   The function returns `True`.

5. For a case like `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`:
   - At index 1 (odd), it contains `2` (even), so it should return `False`.

6. Consider a longer list of mixed values: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - Index 0 is ignored (even).
   - Index 1 is `2` (even), so it returns `False`.

**Finding a Counterexample:**
If we consider a list where all odd indices happen to be odd numbers, e.g., `[0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 5]`, index 1 holds an odd number and index 3 also holds an odd number; hence, we would expect it to return `True`.

However, if there's an even number at an odd index, the function will return `False`, so the logic here seems sufficient.

Now, I would conclude that there isn't any edge case that the program handles incorrectly based on the defined requirements.

**Correctness: True.** 

The program accurately checks for odd indices containing odd numbers according to the problem description.
