The given problem description states that we need to check whether every odd index in a list contains odd numbers. The program `func_1` iterates through the list and checks if the index is odd and if the element at that index is even. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

The output hints indicate that the function checks for even integers at odd indices and returns `True` if no such integers exist, or if the list is empty (at which point considered true). 

However, upon close examination of the code, there is a potential edge case that needs to be considered. The function does return `True` for an empty list, which aligns with the hints. The function also does not take into account the fact that if an odd index contains an odd number, this does not cause an issue, as the requirement is satisfied.

However, the implementation does not check for odd numbers at odd indices, only confirms that there are no even numbers. In a scenario where the list contains elements at odd indices that are indeed odd, it would return `True`, which is expected behavior.

Let's analyze it further with an example:
- For input `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `index 1` has `2` (even), hence it should return `False` as expected.
- For input `lst = [1, 3, 5]`, all odd indices (1) contain odd numbers, thus should return `True` as well.

Considering that there are no logical flaws in the implementation and that all potential edge cases suggest the functionality adheres to the specification outlined by the problem description, we conclude that the program is indeed correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **True**.
