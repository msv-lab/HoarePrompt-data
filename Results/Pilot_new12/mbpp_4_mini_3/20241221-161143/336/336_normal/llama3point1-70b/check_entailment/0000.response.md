Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` iterates through a list `lst` and checks whether every index that is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`) contains an odd number (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 != 0`). If it finds an even number at any odd index, it returns `False`. If all odd indices contain odd numbers, it returns `True`.

This logic correctly follows the problem statement that every odd index must contain odd numbers. The program handles various cases, including when the list is empty or contains only even numbers at odd indices, by returning `True` since there are no odd indices with even numbers.

Examples:
- For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function checks indices 1 and 3. Index 1 contains `2` (even), so it returns `False`.
- For `lst = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, it returns `True` since both odd indices (1 and 3) contain odd numbers.

No potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements can be envisioned, so the logic should be robust for any valid input.
