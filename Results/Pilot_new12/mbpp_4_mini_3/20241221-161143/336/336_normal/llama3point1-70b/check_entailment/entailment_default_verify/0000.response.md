Final: **True**  

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the requirement to check all odd indices for odd numbers, returning `False` if it finds any even integer at those positions. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, returning `True` for empty lists and correctly not altering the input list throughout its execution. 

The reasoning provided in the initial assessment holds, as the logic implemented in the function encompasses all edge cases pertinent to the problem description. Thus, the final conclusion is that the program meets the requirements and behaves correctly as outlined.
