Based on the problem description, the program is supposed to check whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers. The provided implementation, `func_1`, iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any even number at an odd index; otherwise, it returns `True`.

The original assessment correctly identifies how the function works and provides a range of cases to verify its behavior. The annotated version of the code further supports the correctness of the implementation by confirming that all even values at odd indices will correctly lead to a return of `False`, while the valid scenarios will lead to a return of `True`.

Upon re-evaluating the assessment alongside the annotations, it illustrates that:

1. The program correctly identifies odd indices.
2. When an even number is found at any odd index, it can confidently return `False`.
3. It handles empty lists and lists with only one element correctly by returning `True`, as there are no odd indices to validate.

The annotations confirm the correctness of the program's expected behavior for all these cases. Thus, my assessment aligns with the original assessment in that the program meets the requirements set out in the problem description.

Final: **True**
