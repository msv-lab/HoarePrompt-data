To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program checks if every odd index in the list contains odd numbers.

### Problem Description
The task is to ensure that for every element at an odd index in a given list, it must hold that the element is an odd number.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    return True
```

1. **Loop through the list:** The `for` loop runs for each index `i` of the list `lst`.
2. **Check odd indices:** The condition `if i % 2 != 0` checks whether `i` is odd. 
3. **Check if the number is even:** The `lst[i] % 2 == 0` condition checks whether the number at index `i` is even.
4. **Return False if any even number is found:** If an even number is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`.
5. **Return True if all odd indices satisfy the condition:** If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`.

### Validation Against the Problem Description
- The program correctly identifies odd indices (where `i` is odd) and checks whether the values at these indices are odd.
- If any odd index contains an even number, it will return `False`, which aligns with the requirement of checking every odd index.
- If all odd indices contain odd numbers or if there are no odd indices, it will return `True`.

### Conclusion
The program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description by accurately checking the values at odd indices of the list.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it systematically checks each odd index in the list to ensure that it contains an odd number, returning appropriate results based on the findings, which aligns perfectly with the problem requirements.
