You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implemented code.

**Problem Description:** We need a function that checks whether every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

**Logic Breakdown:**
1. The function iterates through each index of the list `lst`.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
3. If `i` is odd and the element at that index `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), it returns `False`.
4. If no odd index contains an even number, the function returns `True`.

**Testing Edge Cases and Potential Problems:**
1. Let's consider an empty list `[]`. In this case, there are no odd indexes, and the function should return `True`. The program handles this correctly.
   
2. Consider a list with only one element `[2]`. There are no odd indexes; thus, the function should return `True`, which it does.

3. For a list with an odd index element being even, such as `[1, 2, 3]`, the second element (at index 1) is even and the first index (odd) is correctly identified. Hence, the function will return `False`.

4. A case with a list like `[0, 1, 2, 3]`: 
   - Index 0 (even), not checked.
   - Index 1 (odd), contains `1` (odd).
   - Index 2 (even), not checked.
   - Index 3 (odd), contains `3` (odd). 
   The function returns `True`.

5. For a case like `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`:
   - At index 1 (odd), it contains `2` (even), so it should return `False`.

6. Consider a longer list of mixed values: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - Index 0 is ignored (even).
   - Index 1 is `2` (even), so it returns `False`.

**Finding a Counterexample:**
If we consider a list where all odd indices happen to be odd numbers, e.g., `[0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 5]`, index 1 holds an odd number and index 3 also holds an odd number; hence, we would expect it to return `True`.

However, if there's an even number at an odd index, the function will return `False`, so the logic here seems sufficient.

Now, I would conclude that there isn't any edge case that the program handles incorrectly based on the defined requirements.

**Correctness: True.** 

The program accurately checks for odd indices containing odd numbers according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `lst` as input and checks the values at the odd indices of the list. It returns `False` if there exists any even integer at an odd index; otherwise, it returns `True`. If the list is empty, it also returns `True`. The function does not alter the input list, maintaining its original state throughout the execution. It effectively ensures that all values at odd indices of the list are either odd, or that there are no even values present at those positions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
