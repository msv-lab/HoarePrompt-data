Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately describes the functionality of the program based on the problem description. The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether every odd index in the list contains odd numbers, and the provided annotated version confirms this behavior. Specifically, the annotations indicate that if any even number is found at an odd index, the function will return `False`, which aligns with the requirements stated in the problem description. Additionally, when there are no even numbers at odd indices or when the list is empty, the function returns `True`, which is also consistent with the expectations.

Overall, the logic of the program is sound, and the annotations support the correctness of the original assessment. Thus, the function meets the criteria specified in the problem description.
