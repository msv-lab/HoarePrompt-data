Correctness: **False**

The program's purpose is to check if every odd index of the given list contains odd numbers. However, there is a case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically:

- The program returns `True` for an empty list, which is acceptable as there are no odd indices to examine.
- The code correctly identifies that if an integer at an odd index is even, it should return `False`.
  
However, the edge case that causes the program to fail is when there are odd indices present, and all of them contain odd integers. The program fails to handle the scenario where an input list has even numbers at odd indices and also contains odd numbers. The design of the function allows for even numbers to exist at odd indices as long as they don't return `False` during the iteration.

For instance, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- The function checks index 1, which contains `2` (even), and would return `False`, which is correct.
  
Alternatively, for an input like `[2, 1, 4, 3]`, the function should return `False` but currently does not handle it correctly since it only checks the condition rather than ensuring that only odd values exist at the odd indices.

Thus, the function does not accurately check if every odd index contains odd numbers as the problem requires, making the solution incorrect.
