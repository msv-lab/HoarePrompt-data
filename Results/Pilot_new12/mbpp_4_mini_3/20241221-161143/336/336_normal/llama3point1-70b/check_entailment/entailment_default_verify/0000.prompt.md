You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` iterates through a list `lst` and checks whether every index that is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`) contains an odd number (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 != 0`). If it finds an even number at any odd index, it returns `False`. If all odd indices contain odd numbers, it returns `True`.

This logic correctly follows the problem statement that every odd index must contain odd numbers. The program handles various cases, including when the list is empty or contains only even numbers at odd indices, by returning `True` since there are no odd indices with even numbers.

Examples:
- For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function checks indices 1 and 3. Index 1 contains `2` (even), so it returns `False`.
- For `lst = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, it returns `True` since both odd indices (1 and 3) contain odd numbers.

No potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements can be envisioned, so the logic should be robust for any valid input.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `lst` as input and checks the values at the odd indices of the list. It returns `False` if there exists any even integer at an odd index; otherwise, it returns `True`. If the list is empty, it also returns `True`. The function does not alter the input list, maintaining its original state throughout the execution. It effectively ensures that all values at odd indices of the list are either odd, or that there are no even values present at those positions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
