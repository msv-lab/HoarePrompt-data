To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze both the problem description and the annotated code to ensure that the implementation satisfies all requirements.

**Problem Description Analysis**:
The function must check whether every odd index in the provided list contains odd numbers. If any odd index contains an even number, the function should return `False`. If all odd indices either contain odd numbers or are non-existent (in the case of an empty list), it should return `True`.

**Annotated Program Analysis**:
1. The function starts a for loop that iterates through all indices of the list `lst`.
2. It checks if the index `i` is odd by using `i % 2 != 0`.
3. It then checks if the element at that odd index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If any such condition is met, it returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, it reaches the `return True` statement.
5. It explicitly states that if the list is empty, it will return `True`, which is consistent with the requirement.

**Conclusion**:
The provided program correctly checks that all odd indices contain odd numbers and implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. There are no edge cases or flaws in the logic that would cause it to fail for valid inputs.

Therefore the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
