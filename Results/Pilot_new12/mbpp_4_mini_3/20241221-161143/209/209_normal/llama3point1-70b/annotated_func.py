#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of lists.
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist from the list of lists 'sublists'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is expected to be a list of lists. It returns a list containing the first element of each sublist from `sublists`. However, if any sublist is empty, it will raise an `IndexError` since it attempts to access the first element without checking if the sublist exists. The final state of the program is a list where each element corresponds to the first element of non-empty sublists, and any empty sublists will cause an error during execution.
