Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case of empty sublists. According to the problem description, the function is expected to return the first element of each non-empty sublist. However, if it encounters an empty sublist, it will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the first element without checking if the sublist exists. 

For example, if the input is `[[], [1, 2], [3]]`, the program will raise an error when it tries to access the first element of the first sublist, which is empty. This behavior does not satisfy the requirement to handle all potential cases, making the program incorrect.
