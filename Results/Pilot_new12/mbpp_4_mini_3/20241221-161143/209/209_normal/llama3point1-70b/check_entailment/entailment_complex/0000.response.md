Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where any of the sublists is empty. According to the problem description, the function should return the first element of each sublist. However, if a sublist is empty, the function attempts to access the first element (i.e., `sublist[0]`), which will lead to an `IndexError`. Therefore, while the function may work correctly for non-empty sublists, it does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential input cases, as it could raise an error for empty sublists.
