Correctness: **False**. 

The program assumes that every sublist in the input `sublists` has at least one element to access the first element (i.e., `sublist[0]`). However, if there is any empty sublist in `sublists`, it will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `sublist[0]`. For example, if we use the input `sublists = [[], [1, 2], [3]]`, the function will crash because it tries to access the first element of the empty sublist. Hence, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
