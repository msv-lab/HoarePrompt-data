To verify the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and ensure it handles all potential cases.

The problem description states that the function should return the first element of each sublist from a list of sublists.

Here is the program for reference:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

**Potential Cases to Consider:**

1. **Normal Case:**
   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`
   - Output: `[1, 4, 7]`
   - This works as expected.

2. **Empty Sublists:**
   - Input: `[[], [], []]`
   - Output: `IndexError` because it tries to access `sublist[0]` where `sublist` is empty.
   - This indicates a failure in handling sublists that are empty.

3. **Single Sublists:**
   - Input: `[[10]]`
   - Output: `[10]`
   - This works as expected.

4. **Mixed Sublists:**
   - Input: `[[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]`
   - Output: `IndexError` on the empty sublist again.
   - This case also reveals that the code doesn't properly handle empty sublists.

Based on the consideration of these potential cases, especially with regards to the empty sublists, the program does not behave correctly in every instance as specified in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**
