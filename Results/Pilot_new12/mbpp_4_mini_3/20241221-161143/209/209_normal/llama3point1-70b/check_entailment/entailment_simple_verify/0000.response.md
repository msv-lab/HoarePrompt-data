The problem description states that the goal is to write a Python function to get the first element of each sublist. The provided program attempts to fulfill this requirement by returning a list comprehension that extracts the first element of each sublist.

However, the original assessment indicates that the program's correctness is **False** because it fails when any sublist is empty, raising an `IndexError`. This is valid reasoning, as trying to access the first element of an empty list (`sublist[0]`) indeed causes a runtime error.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the intention is to return the first element of each sublist, assuming that `sublists` is a list of lists. There is no annotation that suggests the program accounts for any edge cases, such as empty sublists.

Given this information and the assumption that the input will be valid as per the original assessment, there is still a valid concern about potentially encountering empty sublists in the input. Even if we assume valid inputs, we cannot overlook the fact that the function does not safeguard against empty sublists in practice, which means that under certain acceptable conditions it can still lead to an error. 

Because the program does not handle the empty list case, which is a significant oversight, I will maintain the original assessment.

Final: **False**
