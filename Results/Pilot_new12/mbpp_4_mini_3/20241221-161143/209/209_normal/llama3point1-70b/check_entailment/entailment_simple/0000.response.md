Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (`sublists`) as input and uses a list comprehension to return a new list containing the first element of each sublist. 

The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` iterates over each sublist in the `sublists`, and for each `sublist`, it accesses the first element using `sublist[0]`. Assuming valid input (as stated in the problem description), each sublist must contain at least one element, so `sublist[0]` will always return a valid first element without raising an error. 

Since the function meets the requirement of retrieving the first element from each sublist, it adheres to the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct.
