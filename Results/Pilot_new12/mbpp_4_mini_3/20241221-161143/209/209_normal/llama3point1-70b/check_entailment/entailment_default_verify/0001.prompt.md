You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and ensure it handles all potential cases.

The problem description states that the function should return the first element of each sublist from a list of sublists.

Here is the program for reference:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

**Potential Cases to Consider:**

1. **Normal Case:**
   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`
   - Output: `[1, 4, 7]`
   - This works as expected.

2. **Empty Sublists:**
   - Input: `[[], [], []]`
   - Output: `IndexError` because it tries to access `sublist[0]` where `sublist` is empty.
   - This indicates a failure in handling sublists that are empty.

3. **Single Sublists:**
   - Input: `[[10]]`
   - Output: `[10]`
   - This works as expected.

4. **Mixed Sublists:**
   - Input: `[[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]`
   - Output: `IndexError` on the empty sublist again.
   - This case also reveals that the code doesn't properly handle empty sublists.

Based on the consideration of these potential cases, especially with regards to the empty sublists, the program does not behave correctly in every instance as specified in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is expected to be a list of lists. It returns a list containing the first element of each sublist from `sublists`. However, if any sublist is empty, it will raise an `IndexError` since it attempts to access the first element without checking if the sublist exists. The final state of the program is a list where each element corresponds to the first element of non-empty sublists, and any empty sublists will cause an error during execution.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
