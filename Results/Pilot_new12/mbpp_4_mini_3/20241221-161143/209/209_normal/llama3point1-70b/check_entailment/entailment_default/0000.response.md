The provided program attempts to retrieve the first element from each sublist in a list of lists. However, the implementation has critical flaws.

1. According to the output hints, if any sublist is empty, the program will raise an `IndexError` when it attempts to access the first element (index 0). This is significant because the problem description stipulates the requirement to get the first element of each sublist, which is not handled properly in the program.

2. The output hints clearly state that any empty sublists will lead to an error during execution. This indicates that the program does not meet the conditions outlined in the problem description for every potential case.

For example, if the input is:
```python
sublists = [[], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
This would cause the program to crash with an `IndexError` because it tries to access the first element of the empty sublist.

Therefore, the program fails to comply with the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
