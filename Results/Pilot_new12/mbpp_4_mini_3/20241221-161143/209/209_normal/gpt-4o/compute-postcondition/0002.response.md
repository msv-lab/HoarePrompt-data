Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists, where each sublist must contain at least one element. The function returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist from `lst`. If any sublist is empty or if `lst` itself is empty, it will raise an IndexError because the code does not include any checks for the validity of the sublists or handle the scenario where `lst` could be empty. Thus, it assumes that `lst` is always non-empty and each sublist has at least one element.**
