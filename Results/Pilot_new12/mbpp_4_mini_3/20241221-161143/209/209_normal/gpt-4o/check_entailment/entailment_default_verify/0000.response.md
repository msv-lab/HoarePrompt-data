The assessment of the program correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is intended to extract the first element from each sublist of a given list of lists. However, it also identifies a critical issue: if any of the sublists is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`. 

The original assessment states that the function fails in scenarios where a sublist might be empty, thereby justifying that the correctness should be marked as **False**. This aligns with the output hints, which confirm that the function does not include checks for empty sublists or empty input lists and assumes valid input.

Considering the problem description and the stated limitations of the implementation, the original assessment remains valid. The program does not successfully handle the edge cases indicated, thus leading to potential runtime errors.

Final: **False**
