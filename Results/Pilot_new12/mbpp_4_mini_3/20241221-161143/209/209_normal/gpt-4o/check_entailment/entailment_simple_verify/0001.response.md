After analyzing the problem description, the program, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to create a Python function that retrieves the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists. 

2. **Program Behavior**: 
   - The function `func_1` utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `lst` and collects the first element from each sublist.
   - The assertions in the code provide test cases that show expected outputs for various valid inputs (lists of lists where sublists contain at least one element).

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case of empty sublists, which would result in an `IndexError`.

4. **Annotated Code**: 
   - The annotations specify that before calling the function, `lst` is a list of lists, and each sublist contains at least one element. This implies that the annotations presuppose inputs that do not include empty sublists, matching the designed behavior of the function.
   - The behavior specified in the annotations directly aligns with the assumptions mentioned in the context provided: that the input will always be valid, containing no empty sublists.

Given these points and considering the focus on the specified inputs always being valid as per the context, the conclusion is that:

- The function `func_1` will correctly execute and return the desired output as long as the input conditions (such as non-empty sublists) are met. There is an assumption made that the input will be validated externally, and therefore, the error concern regarding empty sublists, while valid in a broader context, does not apply to this specific case.

Thus, based on the reasoning and the details available:

Final: **True**
