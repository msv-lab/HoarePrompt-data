To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function's implementation and the problem description carefully.

**Problem description:**
Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The function `func_1` is intended to return the first element of each sublist from a list of lists.
2. The assert statements are structured to test the function with different inputs and verify that the output matches the expected results.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If given an empty list (`[]`), the function would return `[]`, which is correct because there are no sublists to extract the first element from.
- If one or more sublists are empty (e.g., `func_1([[1, 2], [], [3]])`), the program will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access `sublist[0]` when `sublist` is empty.

The program does not handle the case where a sublist might be empty, which is a critical edge case not covered in the initial problem description. 

Thus, the program fails in such scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not work correctly for input where one or more sublists are empty, leading to an `IndexError`.
