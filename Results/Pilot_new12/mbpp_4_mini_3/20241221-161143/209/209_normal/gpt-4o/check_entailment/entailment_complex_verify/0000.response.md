The original assessment indicates that the program is incorrect due to the possibility of encountering an `IndexError` when any of the sublists is empty. This reasoning is well-founded, as the program does not include checks for sublist contents or handle the case of an empty list or empty sublists within the main list.

However, the annotated version states that the function `func_1` assumes that "lst is a list of lists, and each sublist contains at least one element." This assumption is crucial, and it explicitly sets a constraint on the function's intended usageâ€”namely, that the input will indeed be valid.

Given that the context prescribes valid input (i.e., a list of lists where each sublist is guaranteed to have at least one element), the program does conform to the problem description. Therefore, although the function could fail under other circumstances, its correctness is assessed based on the specified assumption.

Thus, adhering to the assumption of valid inputs, the program correctly returns the first elements of each sublist if the provided conditions are satisfied.

Final: **True**
