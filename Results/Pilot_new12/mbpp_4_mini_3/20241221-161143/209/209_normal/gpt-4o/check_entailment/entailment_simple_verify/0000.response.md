The provided annotated version clearly states the conditions under which the function `func_1` operates, specifically that it assumes the input `lst` consists of a list of lists where each sublist contains at least one element. Given this annotation, one can conclude that the function is implemented to work correctly for the defined conditions.

The program correctly meets the problem description, which is to return the first element of each sublist. It produces the expected output for the provided assertions, assuming valid input as per the annotations.

Since the original assessment pointed out that the program would fail when encountering an empty sublist, but the annotations state that the function only processes lists where each sublist has at least one element, we need to adjust the focus on correctness to align with this assumption of valid input.

Thus, based on the annotations that explicitly restrict input conditions and confirm the behavior when those conditions are met, the program does indeed fulfill the problem description correctly.

Final: **True**
