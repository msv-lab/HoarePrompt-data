Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description, which requires extracting the first element from each sublist within a list of lists. 

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of how the function fulfills the problem:

1. **Input Specification**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a single parameter `lst`, which is supposed to be a list of lists where each sublist contains at least one element. The comments indicate that this assumption is explicitly made, saying "each sublist contains at least one element."

2. **Function Implementation**: The line `return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` efficiently uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in `lst`, accessing the first element `sublist[0]`. This constructs a new list comprising of the first elements of all sublists.

3. **Handling of Valid Inputs**: The provided assertions illustrate valid test cases where valid input is passed to the function, and the expected output is precisely what is returned by the function. Since input handling outside what is assumed (that is, users providing valid input) is not a requirement for correctness in this evaluation, the function adheres to the problem's requirements as defined.

4. **Assurance of Non-Empty Sublists**: The function relies on the assumption that no sublist is empty. If this assumption is met, the function will correctly return the desired output without errors. The program does not need to check for input validity by the specifications given.

Thus, based on the outlined criteria, the annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
