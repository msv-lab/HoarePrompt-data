Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which requires the extraction of the first element from each sublist within a given list of lists. 

Here’s why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The `func_1` function takes a single parameter `lst`, which is assumed to be a list of lists (as stated in the problem description).

2. **List Comprehension**: The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in `lst`, retrieving `sublist[0]`, which is the first element of each sublist.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list containing these first elements, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to get the first element of each sublist.

4. **Assertions for Testing**: The assertions following the function definition provide tests that confirm the function’s correctness for different inputs, all producing the expected results.

Since the assumptions state that inputs will be valid (i.e., lists of lists where each sublist contains at least one element), the implementation will always operate correctly without encountering errors. Thus, the program reliably fulfills the task as defined in the problem description.
