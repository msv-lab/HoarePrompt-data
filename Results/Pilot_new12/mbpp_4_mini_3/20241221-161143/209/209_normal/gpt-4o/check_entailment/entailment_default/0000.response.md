The provided function `func_1(lst)` is designed to return the first element of each sublist contained within the list `lst`. The assertions provided indicate that it functions correctly for the examples given, such as:

- For input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`, it returns `[1, 3, 6]`.
- For input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]`, it returns `[1, 4]`.
- For input `[[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]`, it returns `[9, 1]`.

However, the output hints indicate a significant oversight in the code's logic. It states that if any sublist is empty or the list `lst` itself is empty, an `IndexError` will arise due to the absence of checks validating the conditions of the sublists. 

While the problem description does not explicitly state that the input will always be valid or guarantee the absence of empty lists or sublists, the output hints clarify that the code lacks robustness in handling potential edge cases. Specifically, an empty list `[]` or input like `[[1, 2], [], [3]]` would lead to an `IndexError`, which violates the expectation of correctness for "every potential case."

Thus, since the program fails for certain inputs that could be reasonably expected, it does not adhere strictly to the problem description for all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
