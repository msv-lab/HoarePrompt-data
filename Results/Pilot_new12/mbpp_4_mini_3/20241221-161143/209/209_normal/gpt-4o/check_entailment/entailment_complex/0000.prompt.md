You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists, and each sublist contains at least one element.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist from 'lst', where 'lst' is a list of lists, and each sublist contains at least one element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists, where each sublist must contain at least one element. The function returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist from `lst`. If any sublist is empty or if `lst` itself is empty, it will raise an IndexError because the code does not include any checks for the validity of the sublists or handle the scenario where `lst` could be empty. Thus, it assumes that `lst` is always non-empty and each sublist has at least one element.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
