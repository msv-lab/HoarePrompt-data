Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where one or more sublists may be empty. For instance, calling `func_1([[1, 2], [], [6, 7]]) would raise an IndexError because it attempts to access the first element of an empty sublist, which does not exist. This means the program fails to account for this potential edge case, violating the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.
