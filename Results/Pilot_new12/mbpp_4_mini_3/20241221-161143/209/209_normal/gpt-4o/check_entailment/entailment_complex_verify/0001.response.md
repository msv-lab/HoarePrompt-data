Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where one or more sublists may be empty. Although the annotated version assumes that the input will always be valid and that each sublist contains at least one element, the function does not include any mechanisms to account for potentially empty sublists or an empty main list. As such, calling `func_1` on inputs that contain empty sublists will raise an `IndexError`, violating the requirements of the problem description, which implies that the function should robustly handle all valid inputs according to typical expectations. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect based on its inability to manage edge cases inherent in the specified input structure.
