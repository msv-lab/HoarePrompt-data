Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when any of the sublists is empty or if the input list `lst` itself is empty. The output hints clearly indicate that the code will raise an IndexError in such cases. For instance, if we provide an input like `func_1([[], [1, 2]])`, this would raise an IndexError because the first sublist is empty and the function attempts to access the first element of it. Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
