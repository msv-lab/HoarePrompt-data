You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function's implementation and the problem description carefully.

**Problem description:**
Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.

**Program:**
```python
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The function `func_1` is intended to return the first element of each sublist from a list of lists.
2. The assert statements are structured to test the function with different inputs and verify that the output matches the expected results.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If given an empty list (`[]`), the function would return `[]`, which is correct because there are no sublists to extract the first element from.
- If one or more sublists are empty (e.g., `func_1([[1, 2], [], [3]])`), the program will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access `sublist[0]` when `sublist` is empty.

The program does not handle the case where a sublist might be empty, which is a critical edge case not covered in the initial problem description. 

Thus, the program fails in such scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not work correctly for input where one or more sublists are empty, leading to an `IndexError`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists, where each sublist must contain at least one element. The function returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist from `lst`. If any sublist is empty or if `lst` itself is empty, it will raise an IndexError because the code does not include any checks for the validity of the sublists or handle the scenario where `lst` could be empty. Thus, it assumes that `lst` is always non-empty and each sublist has at least one element.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
