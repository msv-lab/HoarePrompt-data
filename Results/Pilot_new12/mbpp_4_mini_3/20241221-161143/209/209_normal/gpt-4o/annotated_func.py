#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists, and each sublist contains at least one element.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist from 'lst', where 'lst' is a list of lists, and each sublist contains at least one element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists, where each sublist must contain at least one element. The function returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist from `lst`. If any sublist is empty or if `lst` itself is empty, it will raise an IndexError because the code does not include any checks for the validity of the sublists or handle the scenario where `lst` could be empty. Thus, it assumes that `lst` is always non-empty and each sublist has at least one element.
