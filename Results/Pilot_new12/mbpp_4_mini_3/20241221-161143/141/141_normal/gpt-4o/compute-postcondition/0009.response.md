`frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. Since `digit` is defined as the second character of `digit_str`, `frequency` now has a count for the digit corresponding to that character increased by one. The state of the other variables remains valid and unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `digit_str` must have at least 2 characters, `frequency` is a dictionary with the count of `digit` increased by 1, and `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`.**
