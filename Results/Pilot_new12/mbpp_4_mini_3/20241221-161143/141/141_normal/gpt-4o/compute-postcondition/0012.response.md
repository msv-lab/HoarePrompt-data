According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `digit_str`. For the loop to execute again, the `digit_str` must have at least one more character available for iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `digit_str` has at least 2 characters, and the last processed `digit` would be the second character. 

After the last iteration, the current index of the character in `digit_str` would be 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, it must process the third character. Therefore, `digit_str` must have at least 3 characters.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `digit_str` has at least 3 characters, and `frequency` is a dictionary.**
