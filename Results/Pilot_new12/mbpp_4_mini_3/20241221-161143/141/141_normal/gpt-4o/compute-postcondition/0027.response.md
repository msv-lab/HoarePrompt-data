Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary where for every digit key, the value count of that key is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit. If `n` is 0, then frequency will be {'0': 1}. If `n` is greater than 0, then frequency contains all distinct digits of `n` with their respective counts satisfying the condition mentioned.**
