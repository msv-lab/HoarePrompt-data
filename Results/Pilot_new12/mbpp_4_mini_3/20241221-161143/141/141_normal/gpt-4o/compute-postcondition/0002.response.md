According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digit_str`. The variable `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, which means it will contain characters only if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0, `digit_str` will be an empty string, and the loop will not execute.

Since we're given that `n` is a non-negative integer, we need to note that if `n` is 0, `digit_str` will be an empty string, thus the loop will not run. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, we can conclude the following: 

1. `n` should be at least 1 for `digit_str` to have any digits.
2. `digit_str` should correspondingly be a non-empty string of digits.
3. At the start of the loop, `digit` will take the value of the first character (digit) from `digit_str`.

Consequently, we need to adjust the state to ensure the loop will execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is an empty dictionary, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`**
