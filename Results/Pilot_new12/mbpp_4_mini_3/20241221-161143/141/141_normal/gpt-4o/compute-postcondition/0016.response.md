Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary where each key is a distinct digit from `digit_str`, and each corresponding value is the count of how many times that digit appears in `digit_str`. If `n` is 0, `digit_str` will be "0" and `frequency` will be {'0': 1}. If `n` is greater than 0, `frequency` will include digits present in the string representation of `n` with their respective counts.**
