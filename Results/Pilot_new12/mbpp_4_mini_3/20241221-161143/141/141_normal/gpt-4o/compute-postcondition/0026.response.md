Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` has at least 3 key-value pairs, with `digit` as the third key and `count` as its associated value. If `count` is greater than `int(digit)`, the function returns False. If `count` is less than or equal to `int(digit)`, there is no return value.***
