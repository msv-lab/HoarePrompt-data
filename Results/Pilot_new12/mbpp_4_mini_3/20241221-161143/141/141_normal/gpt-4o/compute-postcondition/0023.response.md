Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` contains at least one more key-value pair with `digit` as the second key and `count` as the associated value. If `count` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no specific return value is generated.***
