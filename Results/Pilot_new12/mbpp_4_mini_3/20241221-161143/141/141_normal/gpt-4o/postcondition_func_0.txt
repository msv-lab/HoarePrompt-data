The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and analyzes the frequency of each digit in its string representation. It constructs a dictionary `frequency` that counts how many times each digit appears. The function then checks whether the count of each digit is less than or equal to the digit's value. If any digit's count exceeds its numeric value, the function returns `False`. If all digit counts satisfy this condition, the function returns `True`. Edge cases include handling the input `0`, which is correctly represented, resulting in a frequency of `{'0': 1}`, and thus returning `False`, as `1` (frequency) is not less than or equal to `0` (value of digit). The function correctly handles any non-negative integer, including multi-digit numbers and those with repeating digits.
