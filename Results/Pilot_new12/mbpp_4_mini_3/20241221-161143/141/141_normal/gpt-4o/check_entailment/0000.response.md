To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it against the problem description, which states that the function should check whether the frequency of each digit in an integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
assert func_1(1234) == True
assert func_1(51241) == False
assert func_1(321) == True

def func_1(n):
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

Let's break down the function:

1. It converts the integer `n` to a string `digit_str` for easy iteration over its digits one by one.
2. It uses a dictionary `frequency` to count how many times each digit appears in the integer.
3. It then checks if the count of each digit exceeds its numeric value:
   - If `count` (the frequency of a digit) is greater than the integer value of that digit (`int(digit)`), it returns `False`.
   - If all frequencies are within limits, it returns `True`.

### Testing Edge Cases
1. For an input where there are digits with counts exceeding their values:
   - Input: `111` should return `False` because the digit `1` appears `3` times, which exceeds `1`. 

2. For a single-digit input where the digit appears the same number of times as its own value:
   - Input: `0` returns `True` because `0` appears `1` time, and `1` is not greater than `0`. 

3. For the original case:
   - Input: `51241` returns `False` because digit `5` appears once and is fine, but the digit `2` appears once which is fine but `1` appears once and is also fine, however, input like `1111` is bad where `1` appears `4` times which goes beyond the limit. 

The program correctly identifies if the frequency constraint is upheld for all digits present. However, it misses the digit `0` case, which should not be included because it cannot have a count greater than itself. 

### Conclusion
To find if there are any uncovered edge cases, let's run a few tests:
- `func_1(111)` → expecting `False`.
- `func_1(121)` → should return `True` since both `1` are within their limits.
- `func_1(123456789)` → Expect `True` as none repeat.

Since the program correctly handles most of the expected test cases but fails to manage when `0` is possibly included, it leads us to classify it as incorrect as mentioned.

Correctness: **False**.
