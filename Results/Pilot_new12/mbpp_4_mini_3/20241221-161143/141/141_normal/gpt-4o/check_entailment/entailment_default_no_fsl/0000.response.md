Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input number is `0` correctly, even though the output hints mentioned this case. According to the problem description, the frequency of the digit `0` should be checked against its value, which is `0`. If `func_1(0)` is called, it would return `False` because the frequency of `0` is `1`, which is greater than its value of `0`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for input `0`, thus making it incorrect as it does not properly handle this edge case.
