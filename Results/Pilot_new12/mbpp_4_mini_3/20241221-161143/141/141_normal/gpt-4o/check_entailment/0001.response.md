To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function and consider various edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to write a function that checks whether the frequency of each digit in an integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Given Examples
1. `func_1(1234)` should return `True`:
   - Frequencies: 1 (one time), 2 (one time), 3 (one time), 4 (one time). 
   - Each frequency is less than or equal to the respective digit.

2. `func_1(51241)` should return `False`:
   - Frequencies: 5 (one time), 1 (two times), 2 (one time), 4 (one time). 
   - The digit '1' appears twice which is more than its value of `1`.

3. `func_1(321)` should return `True`:
   - Frequencies: 3 (one time), 2 (one time), 1 (one time). 
   - Each frequency is less than or equal to the respective digit.

### Checking the Function
Now, let’s check the implementation of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n):
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Edge Cases
Let's consider a few additional cases:
1. `func_1(0)`:
   - Frequencies: 0 appears once. 
   - The frequency (1) is greater than the digit (0), hence it should return `False`.

2. `func_1(22)`:
   - Frequencies: 2 appears twice. 
   - The frequency (2) equals the digit (2), this should return `True`.

3. `func_1(1111)`:
   - Frequencies: 1 appears four times. 
   - The frequency (4) is greater than the digit (1), hence it should return `False`.

4. `func_1(444444)`:
   - Frequencies: 4 appears six times.
   - The frequency (6) is greater than the digit (4), hence it should return `False`.

### Conclusion
The implementation does not account for cases where the digits may exceed their allowed frequency. Specifically:
- The case `func_1(0)` should return `False` but there’s no assertion for it in the program.

Since the program fails for at least one input, we conclude that the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

The function is incorrect because it does not correctly handle cases where the digits are `0` or where the frequency exceeds the digit itself.
