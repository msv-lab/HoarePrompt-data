Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` is incorrect because it does not adhere to the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the requirement is to check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

In the provided code, there is a significant edge case concerning the digit '0'. According to the problem description, if the digit is '0', the frequency of that digit must be less than or equal to '0'. However, the code allows a digit frequency of '1' for '0', which violates the condition. When the input is `0`, the function creates a frequency dictionary `{'0': 1}`, and since the frequency (1) is not less than or equal to the digit value (0), the function should return `False`. 

This means that the example cases tested in the assertions do not properly cover all edge cases, particularly the case of zero. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirement outlined in the problem description accurately for all potential cases, leading to an incorrect implementation.
