The given program is designed to check whether the frequency of each digit in a non-negative integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's analyze how the function `func_1` works against the provided problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts a non-negative integer `n` and converts it into a string to analyze each digit.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: It calculates the frequency of each digit by iterating over the string representation of the integer. The frequencies are stored in a dictionary, where the key is the digit and the value is its count.

3. **Condition Checking**: It then iterates over the frequency dictionary. For each digit, it checks whether the frequency of that digit is greater than the digit itself. If it finds any digit whose frequency exceeds its value, it returns `False`.

4. **Final Output**: If all digit frequencies are valid (i.e., less than or equal to the digit itself), the function returns `True`.

Now, let’s evaluate the specifics of the provided assertions:

- **For `func_1(1234)`**: The digit frequencies are:
    - '1' occurs once (1 ≤ 1)
    - '2' occurs once (1 ≤ 2)
    - '3' occurs once (1 ≤ 3)
    - '4' occurs once (1 ≤ 4)
    
  All conditions are satisfied, so it returns `True`.

- **For `func_1(51241)`**: The digit frequencies are:
    - '5' occurs once (1 ≤ 5)
    - '1' occurs twice (2 ≤ 1) **(does not satisfy)**
    - '2' occurs once (1 ≤ 2)
    - '4' occurs once (1 ≤ 4)
  
  The frequency of '1' exceeds its value, and thus it correctly returns `False`.

- **For `func_1(321)`**: The digit frequencies are:
    - '3' occurs once (1 ≤ 3)
    - '2' occurs once (1 ≤ 2)
    - '1' occurs once (1 ≤ 1)
    
  All conditions are satisfied, so it returns `True`.

Since the implementation of the program correctly adheres to the requirements of the problem description, it checks the frequency of each digit and compares it correctly against the digit's value.

Thus, the program meets the problem description completely for all potential cases as we have outlined above.

Correctness: **True**
