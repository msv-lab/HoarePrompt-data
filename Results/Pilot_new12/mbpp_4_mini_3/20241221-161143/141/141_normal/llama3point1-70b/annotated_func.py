#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer; `str_n` is the string representation of `n`; if the loop executed, for every digit in `str_n`, the count of that digit in `str_n` is less than or equal to its integer value; if the loop did not execute, `str_n` is an empty string or contains only characters not corresponding to a digit.
    return True
    #The program returns True as the loop either executed and verified the condition for each digit in 'str_n', or 'str_n' is empty or contains non-digit characters
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks the frequency of each digit in its string representation `str_n`. It returns `False` if any digit appears more times in `str_n` than its integer value. If all digits meet this condition (i.e., each digit's count is less than or equal to its value), or if `n` is zero (resulting in `str_n` being '0'), the function returns `True`. Note that the function does not handle cases where `n` is negative since it is specified to be non-negative; thus, it may fail if negative values are passed despite the initial precondition. Additionally, if the input is non-integer or if `n` only consists of non-digit characters, the function will not execute correctly, potentially returning `True` based on faulty assumptions of the input.
