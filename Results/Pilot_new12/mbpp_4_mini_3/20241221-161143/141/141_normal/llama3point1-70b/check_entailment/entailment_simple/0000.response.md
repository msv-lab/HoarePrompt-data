To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the behavior of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function should take an integer `n` and verify that the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    return True
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Conversion to String**: The integer `n` is converted into its string representation (`str_n`), allowing the program to iterate over each character (digit).

2. **Frequency Check**: The program uses a loop to iterate over each digit in `str_n`. For each digit:
    - It counts how many times that digit occurs in the string `str_n` (`str_n.count(digit)`).
    - It compares this count to the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).

3. **Return Values**:
    - If the count of the digit exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns `False`.
    - If all digits pass this check (i.e., the loop completes without finding a digit with a count greater than its value), the function returns `True`.

### Key Considerations:
- The program handles non-negative integers as specified in the problem description.
- It correctly verifies that for each digit, the count does not exceed the digit itself.
- The functionâ€™s logic adheres to the problem condition for every digit within valid integers.

### Performance Consideration:
- The use of `str_n.count(digit)` within a loop could be inefficient due to redundancy; for every digit, the string is traversed again to count occurrences. However, this inefficiency does not affect correctness.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer meets the condition specified in the problem description. 

Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
