Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the problem description by ensuring that the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Here is a breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. The function named `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`, which is in line with the problem description.
2. The program converts the integer `n` into its string representation using `str(n)`, allowing it to iterate over each digit easily.
3. For each digit in the string representation, the program checks if the count of that digit in the string (`str_n.count(digit)`) is greater than the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).
4. If it finds any digit whose count exceeds its value, it returns `False`, which directly corresponds to the requirement to return false if any digit violates the frequency condition.
5. If the loop completes without finding such a violation, it returns `True`, which means that all digits meet the specified frequency condition.

Additionally, the program accommodates all valid inputs as specified in the problem description, since it does not expect or handle negative numbers and is designed to read non-negative integers correctly.

Therefore, considering the program's functionality is consistent with the problem description and it correctly checks the constraints as outlined, it can be concluded that the program is correct, resulting in:

Correctness: **True**
