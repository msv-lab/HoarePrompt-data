Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` checks the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` (represented as a string) and returns `False` if any digit appears more times than its integer value. While the code appears to work correctly for non-negative integers, it has several issues:

1. **Negative Inputs**: The function does not handle negative integers even though the description specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer. If a negative integer is passed, the function may lead to unexpected results since the logic is not designed to process negative values.

2. **Input Type Assumption**: The problem description does not explicitly state that `n` will always be an integer. While the task implies it should be a non-negative integer, if a non-integer or a string consisting of non-digit characters were to be passed, the function would not execute correctly and could potentially produce erroneous outputs or fail completely without any feedback.

In summary, while the function might work correctly for valid non-negative integer inputs, it does not account for all potential input cases, such as negatives or invalid types, leading to an overall determination of incorrectness based on the problem description's inclusivity requirements.
