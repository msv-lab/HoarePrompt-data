To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the functionality of the function `func_1`.

The problem states that the function should take an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis:

1. The program converts the integer `n` to a string `str_n` so that it can iterate over each digit.

2. For each `digit` in the string representation, it checks if the count of that digit in `str_n` (using `str_n.count(digit)`) is greater than the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).

3. If at any point, the frequency of a digit exceeds its integer value, the function returns `False`. If all digits pass the check, it returns `True`.

### Possible Edge Cases:

- **Input with multiple digits**: For example, `n = 112` should return `True` since:
  - '1' appears 2 times, which is not greater than 1.
  - '2' appears 1 time, which is not greater than 2.
  
- **Input with only zero**: `n = 0` should return `True` since '0' appears once but its frequency (1) does not exceed the digit (0).
  
- **Input with digit exceeding its count**: For instance, `n = 2222` should return `False`, since the digit '2' appears 4 times, which is greater than 2.

- **Leading zeros**: The function does not handle cases where numbers may have leading zeros, but since integer input would strip leading zeros, this is not relevant.

### Counterexample to show failure:

Let's take `n = 221` as an example:
- The frequency of '2' is 2, which is equal to 2, and passes.
- The frequency of '1' is 1, which is also less than or equal to 1, and passes.

In this case, the function would return `True`, but the logic could fail with the input `n = 2223`:
- Frequency of '2' is 3, which exceeds the digit itself (2), hence it should return `False`. The function checks this correctly.
  
However, now consider `n = 100`:
- Frequency of '1' is 1 (valid), but frequency of '0' is 2, which is greater than '0', thus returning `False`, which is incorrect since '0' can appear as many times as it wants.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw wherein it does not correctly assess the condition of zero; it allows a digit to occur more times than itself when it shouldn't.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to correctly handle the digit '0' which can never exceed its frequency; therefore it incorrectly identifies some cases as valid when they are not.
