According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `n` (which is `str_n`). At the end of the last iteration, `digit` holds the value of the current character in `str_n`. 

Given that `n` is at least 10, `str_n` will contain at least two characters, which are the digits from that non-negative integer. The loop will execute once for each character in `str_n`. After the last iteration, `digit` will be set to the last character of the string. For the loop to execute one more time, `digit` would need to move to the next character in `str_n`, which is not possible as it is currently at the end of the string.

Therefore, in order to determine whether the loop can continue, we need to consider the length of `str_n`. If the length is `len(str_n)`, at the end of the last iteration, `digit` would be the character at index `len(str_n) - 1`. Thus, if `str_n` has a length of at least 2 to start with, we can infer that there is still one more digit available at index `len(str_n) - 2`.

To summarize, the relevant changes for the loop to execute again would be that `digit` will need to refer to the next character, which would be the second last character.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer that is at least 10, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, `digit` is the character at the index corresponding to the second last character in `str_n`.**
