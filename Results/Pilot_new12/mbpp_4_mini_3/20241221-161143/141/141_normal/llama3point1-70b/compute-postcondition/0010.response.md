Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer that is at least 10, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, and `digit` is the character at the index corresponding to the second last character in `str_n`. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False; otherwise, no action is taken in the else part.***
