`str_n` is assigned the string representation of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` will be the string that corresponds to the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `str_n` is the string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `str_n` is the string representation of `n`.**
