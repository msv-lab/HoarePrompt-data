Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer that is at least 10, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, and `digit` is the first character of `str_n`. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` exceeds `int(digit)`, the function returns False; otherwise, the function has no specified return value.***
