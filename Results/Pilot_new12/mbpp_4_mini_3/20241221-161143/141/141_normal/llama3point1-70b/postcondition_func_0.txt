The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks the frequency of each digit in its string representation `str_n`. It returns `False` if any digit appears more times in `str_n` than its integer value. If all digits meet this condition (i.e., each digit's count is less than or equal to its value), or if `n` is zero (resulting in `str_n` being '0'), the function returns `True`. Note that the function does not handle cases where `n` is negative since it is specified to be non-negative; thus, it may fail if negative values are passed despite the initial precondition. Additionally, if the input is non-integer or if `n` only consists of non-digit characters, the function will not execute correctly, potentially returning `True` based on faulty assumptions of the input.
