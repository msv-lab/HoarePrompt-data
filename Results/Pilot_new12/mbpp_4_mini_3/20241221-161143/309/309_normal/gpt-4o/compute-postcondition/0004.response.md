According to the code, for the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character, which is established since `s` is stated to be a non-empty string. The first character of `s`, `first_char`, is correctly initialized to the first character of `s`. Furthermore, during the first iteration of the loop, `char` would take the value of `first_char`. Thus, if `s` has at least one character, the loop will execute.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s` during the first iteration**
