According to the code, the for loop iterates through each character in the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, there are characters that can be processed in the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the second character of `s`, which implies that there may still be more characters left to iterate over. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to increment the index to the next character in the string. Since the current character `char` is the second character, the next character in the string will be the third character. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we recognize that:
- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `char` becomes the third character in the string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the third character in the string.**
