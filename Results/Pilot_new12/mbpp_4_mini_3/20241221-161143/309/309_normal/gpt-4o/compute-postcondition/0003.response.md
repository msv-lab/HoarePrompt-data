The variable `first_char` is assigned the value of the first character of the string `s`. The value of `s` is not specified, but it is confirmed to be a non-empty string, so `first_char` will contain the first character of that non-empty string. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment while retaining the other information about `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, and `s` is not an empty string; `first_char` is the first character of `s`.**
