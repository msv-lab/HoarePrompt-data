#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, and `s` is not an empty string.
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and all characters `char` in `s` are equal to `first_char`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all characters in the non-empty string 's' are equal to the first character 'first_char'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. It checks if the string is empty; if so, it returns True. If `s` is not empty, the function establishes the first character of the string and iterates through each character in `s`. It returns False if it encounters any character that does not match the first character. If all characters match the first character, it returns True. Therefore, the function verifies if all characters in the non-empty string `s` are the same as the first character, handling the edge case of an empty string appropriately by returning True. However, it does not require "Case_3" and "Case_4" as mentioned in the return postconditions since the function directly returns on the first mismatch or if the string is empty, thus those cases are not relevant to the implementation.
