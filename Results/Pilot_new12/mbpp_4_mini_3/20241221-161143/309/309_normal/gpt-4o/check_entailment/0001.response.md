Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is designed to determine if all characters in a given string are the same. However, there is a flaw in the function when dealing with an empty string. According to the problem description, there is no specification on how empty strings should be handled. The function returns `True` for an empty string, which could be considered incorrect based on different interpretations of "all the characters are the same." 

If we consider that "all characters are the same" implies there must be at least one character, then the function fails for an empty string. Therefore, when the input is an empty string, the output should be `False`, leading to an inconsistency with the problem description.

Thus, since the function does not correctly handle all potential cases (specifically, the empty string case), it is incorrect.
