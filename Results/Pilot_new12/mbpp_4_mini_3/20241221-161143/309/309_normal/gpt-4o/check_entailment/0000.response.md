Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is designed to check whether all characters in a string are the same. However, there is a flaw in its logicâ€”specifically regarding the handling of an empty string. The function currently returns `True` for an empty string, while it would be more appropriate to consider that case as not "all characters being the same" since there are no characters to compare. Therefore, an empty input should ideally return `False`. 

For instance:
- If we input `''` (an empty string), the function will return `True`, which does not meet the requirement of checking whether all characters are the same, as there are no characters to evaluate.

Thus the provided function does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
