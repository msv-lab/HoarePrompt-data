Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the requirements for all potential cases. While it correctly returns `True` for strings where all characters are the same and `False` otherwise, the handling of the edge case for an empty string is incorrect. According to many interpretations, an empty string should be considered to not have any repeated characters, which would logically return `False` instead of `True`. 

For example:
- For an empty string `''`, the function currently returns `True`, suggesting that all characters are the same, which is not applicable.

Therefore, because the program does not correctly assess the case of an empty string, it is deemed incorrect for at least this edge case.
