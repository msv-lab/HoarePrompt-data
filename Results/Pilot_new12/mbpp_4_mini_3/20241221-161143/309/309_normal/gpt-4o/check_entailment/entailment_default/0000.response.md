Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the non-empty string `s` are the same. If the string is empty, it returns True, which is appropriate as the problem description suggests that no characters means they can be considered the same. The logic in the code iterates through each character in the string, comparing it to the first character. If it finds any character that does not match, it returns False, which ensures that it will only return True if all characters are indeed the same. The provided examples in the assertions confirm that the function performs correctly across various cases. There are no potential edge cases or scenarios described in the problem statement that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, the program meets the problem's requirements fully.
