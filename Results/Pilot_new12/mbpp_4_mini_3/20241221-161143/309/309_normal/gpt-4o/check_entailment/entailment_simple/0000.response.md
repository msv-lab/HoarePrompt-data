To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze if the function `func_1(s)` correctly identifies whether all characters in the string `s` are the same.

### Problem Description:
**Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.**

### Program Analysis:
1. The function `func_1(s)` starts by checking if `s` is empty. If it is empty, the function returns `True`. This is particularly important to note because it implies that an empty string is considered to have "all characters the same" by default.

2. If `s` is not empty:
   - The first character of the string is stored in `first_char`.
   - A loop iterates through each character in the string `s`, comparing each character to `first_char`.
   - If any character does not match `first_char`, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. If the loop completes without finding any differing characters, the function returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.

### Test Cases:
- `func_1('python')`: Contains different characters, so it returns `False`.
- `func_1('aaa')`: All characters are the same, so it returns `True`.
- `func_1('data')`: Contains different characters, so it returns `False`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly evaluates the condition set forth in the problem description:
- It accurately identifies whether all characters in the input string are the same.
- It returns `True` for an empty string, which is a reasonable interpretation of the problem description.
- All functional paths and return values align with the expectations outlined in the problem statement.

Since the function adheres to the requirements specified in the problem description and correctly implements the necessary logic for all cases, we can conclude that it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
