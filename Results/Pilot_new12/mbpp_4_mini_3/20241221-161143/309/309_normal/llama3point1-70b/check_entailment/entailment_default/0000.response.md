Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of that set is 1 (which would mean all characters are the same). The output hints clarify that the function also correctly handles the edge case of an empty string, where it returns `True` because there are no differing characters. However, the function does not handle non-string types as input, which would result in a TypeError when creating a set from a non-string type. This means the function does not fulfill the requirement to handle all potential input cases effectively.

Correctness: **False**.
