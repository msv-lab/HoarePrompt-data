Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to check whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same. 

Here’s how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(s)` takes a single string argument `s`.

2. **Character Comparison**: The function uses a set to determine if all characters are the same. The `set(s)` operation creates a set of unique characters from the string. If all characters in `s` are the same, the length of the set will be 1 (since there’s only one unique character).

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the length of the set is 1 (indicating all characters are the same) and `False` otherwise. This directly aligns with the requirement to check if all characters are the same.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem description assumes that the input will always be valid (non-empty strings), so edge cases involving empty strings or other data types that could generate errors are not applicable here.

Since the logic is sound and fulfills the requirement as stated in the problem description, the program is determined to be correct.
