Final: **False** 

The original assessment concluded that the program is correct; however, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle types other than strings. Specifically, passing non-string types will result in a `TypeError`, which means the program does not fully meet the problem description's requirements. While the function works well for string inputs, the lack of error handling for other input types is a significant oversight, leading to an assessment of incorrectness. Thus, the program's behavior does not align with the complete expectation of robustness indicated in the problem description.
