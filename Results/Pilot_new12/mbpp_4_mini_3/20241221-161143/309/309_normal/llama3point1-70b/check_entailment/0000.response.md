Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` checks whether all the characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of that set is equal to 1. Since a set only contains unique elements, if the length is 1, it means all characters in the string were identical.

This logic will work for all potential cases:
1. If the input string is empty (`""`), the set will also be empty, and the length will be 0, indicating that not all characters are the same (as there are no characters).
2. For a string with one character, such as `"a"`, the set will contain only that one character, and the length will be 1, indicating all characters are the same.
3. For strings with multiple characters, like `"aaa"`, the set will contain just the character `'a'`, resulting in a length of 1, indicating all characters are the same. Conversely, for input like `"abc"`, the set will contain three unique characters, resulting in a length of 3, indicating not all characters are the same.

Since the function handles these edge cases correctly, it is considered correct.
