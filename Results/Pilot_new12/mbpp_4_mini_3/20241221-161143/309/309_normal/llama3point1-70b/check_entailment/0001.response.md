Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set of characters and checking if the length of that set is 1. 

This approach is correct for several reasons:
1. If the string is empty, `set(s)` will also be empty, and its length will be 0, which correctly indicates that not all characters are the same (since there are no characters).
2. If the string has one character, `set(s)` will contain just that character, and its length will be 1, correctly indicating that all characters are the same.
3. For strings with multiple characters, the length of the set will only be 1 if all characters are identical. If there are different characters, the set's length will reflect that accurately.

Thus, the function covers all potential cases: empty strings, single-character strings, and strings with varying characters. There are no edge cases where the function would produce incorrect results according to the problem description.
