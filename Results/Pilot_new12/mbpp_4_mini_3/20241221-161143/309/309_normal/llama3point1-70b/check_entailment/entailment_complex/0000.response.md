Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description, which is to check whether all characters in a given string are the same. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(s)` is designed to accept a string `s` and determine if all characters in that string are identical.

2. **Logic Used**: The use of `set(s)` creates a set of characters from the string `s`. Since a set does not allow duplicate values, if all characters in the string are the same, the set will only contain one unique character. Therefore, checking if `len(set(s)) == 1` will return `True` if all characters are the same, and `False` otherwise.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function appropriately returns `True` for an empty string (`""`), as an empty string has no differing characters. 

4. **Assumptions on Input**: The function does not explicitly handle characters other than strings, but due to the assumption stated in the task that inputs will be valid, this aspect does not detract from its correctness per the given problem constraints.

Overall, the implementation aligns with the problem description, correctly identifies when all characters in the string are the same, and has been annotated to clarify its behavior. Thus, we deem it correct in the context provided.
