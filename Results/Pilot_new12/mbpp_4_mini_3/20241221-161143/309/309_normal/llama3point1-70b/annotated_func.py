#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string containing characters.
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all characters in string 's' are the same, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in `s` are the same; otherwise, it returns `False`. It correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty string, returning `True` since there are no differing characters. The function does not handle types other than strings, as passing non-string types would result in a TypeError when attempting to create a set.
