Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure, handling lists that can contain integers or other lists nested to any depth.

Here's why the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Recursive Flattening**: The function uses recursion to traverse any nested lists within the `nested_list`. When it encounters an element that is itself a list, it calls `func_1` on that element, which allows it to flatten lists of any depth.

2. **Appending Integers**: The function appends integers found at the top level and within nested lists to the `flat_list`. This ensures that all integers are collected, regardless of their nesting level.

3. **Original List Preservation**: The program is careful to not modify the original `nested_list`, ensuring that it remains unchanged throughout the process. This adheres to the requirement stated in the functionâ€™s annotations, where it emphasizes that `nested_list` remains as the original input list.

4. **Handling Valid Inputs**: The function is assumed to be provided valid input (as stated in the problem description), which means that it is expected to receive a list, even if it contains other invalid types besides integers. As specified, it will simply ignore any non-integer and non-list types, which is acceptable per the problem requirements.

In summary, the function operates correctly by recursively flattening any nested structure while preserving the integrity of the original input. Therefore, it meets the problem's expectations comprehensively.
