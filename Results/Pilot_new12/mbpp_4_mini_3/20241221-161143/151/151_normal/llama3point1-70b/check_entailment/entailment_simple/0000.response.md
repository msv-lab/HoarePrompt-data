Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to flatten a nested list structure, as required by the problem description. Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Handling Nested Lists**: The program recursively checks each element of `nested_list`. If the element is itself a list, it calls `func_1` on that element to further flatten it. This depth-first approach allows the function to handle lists nested to any level.

2. **Building the Flattened List**: The function utilizes `flat_list.extend()` to add all elements from the flattened sublist back into `flat_list`. For non-list elements (which are assumed to be integers as per the description), it directly appends them to `flat_list`.

3. **Preservation of Input**: The program does not modify `nested_list`; it creates a new list `flat_list` to store the flattened results. This aligns with good programming practices, ensuring the original input remains unchanged.

4. **Robust against Valid Inputs**: As stated in the setup, the function will receive valid input (a list that may contain integers or other lists). It does not concern itself with handling invalid input types, as per the assumptions given.

In conclusion, the implementation accurately follows the problem's requirements for flattening a nested list structure and handles all valid scenarios specified. Therefore, the output is deemed correct.
