Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure; however, it fails to handle non-integer and non-list types within the provided `nested_list`. According to the output hints, the function ignores any element that is not an integer or a list, which means if a nested list contains data types such as strings, dictionaries, or other objects, these will be omitted from the final output.

For example, given the input `nested_list = [1, [2, 'three'], 4]`, the expected output, if handling all data types correctly, would ideally be `[1, 2, 4]`, assuming only integers are kept. However, since the function does not explicitly handle or document how it deals with strings or other types, we cannot say the function meets the problem requirements accurately across all potential cases. 

Thus, the program's inability to process certain input types correctly leads to `Correctness: False`.
