Final: **False**

The original assessment indicates that the program correctly implements the functionality to flatten a nested list structure. However, the output hints clarify that the function `func_1` does not handle non-integer types and will ignore them, which means it does not fulfill the expectations set forth in the problem description accurately. 

The key points in the hints specify that:
- The function only extracts integers and nested lists, ignoring any other types of elements, which contradicts the claim of handling mixed types properly.
- This means the functionality described in the assessment is incomplete as it does not consider or include all potential elements that could be found in a nested list structure, specifically non-integer, non-list types.

Therefore, due to the failure to handle various valid inputs as per the problem description, the program does not meet the correctness criteria stated in the original assessment.
