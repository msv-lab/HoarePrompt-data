Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully meets the problem description by correctly flattening a nested list structure. The recursive approach allows the function to handle any level of nested lists, and it appends only integers to the resulting `flat_list`. According to the output hints, while the function does not handle non-list or non-integer types, it still adheres to the assumption that valid inputs will be provided, aligning with the parameters outlined in the problem description. The examples provided (e.g., flattening `[1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6]`) demonstrate that the function correctly returns a flattened list. Thus, the implementation is robust under the expected conditions, justifying the assessment of correctness.
