Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure by recursively processing the input list. While it appropriately handles lists of integers and nested lists, it fails to manage cases where the elements are neither lists nor integers. According to the output hints, non-list and non-integer types will be ignored, which means that data contained in these elements will not be included in the resulting flattened list. 

For example, if the input `nested_list` is `[[1, 2], [3, 'a']]`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3]`, thereby ignoring the string `'a'`. The problem description does not specify that non-integer types should be ignored, and thus this behavior is a deviation from what might be expected based on the standard idea of "flattening." Therefore, the program does not meet the specification for all potential cases, leading to an overall assessment of incorrectness.
