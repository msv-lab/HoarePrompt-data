Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively traversing the list. It checks each element: if the element is a list, it recursively flattens that list; if it's not a list, it appends the element to `flat_list`. This means that regardless of the depth of nesting, the function will handle all cases appropriately. 

For example:
- For an input like `[1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6]`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the correct flattened result.
- An input of `[]` will correctly return `[]`, still flattening an empty list as required.

Thus, while the function handles various complexities of nested structures, it doesn't exhibit any logical flaws or unhandled edge cases. Therefore, it meets the problem description's requirements fully.
