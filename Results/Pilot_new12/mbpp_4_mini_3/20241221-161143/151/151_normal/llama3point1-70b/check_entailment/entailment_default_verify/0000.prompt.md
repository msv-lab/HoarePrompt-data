You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively traversing the list. It checks each element: if the element is a list, it recursively flattens that list; if it's not a list, it appends the element to `flat_list`. This means that regardless of the depth of nesting, the function will handle all cases appropriately. 

For example:
- For an input like `[1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6]`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the correct flattened result.
- An input of `[]` will correctly return `[]`, still flattening an empty list as required.

Thus, while the function handles various complexities of nested structures, it doesn't exhibit any logical flaws or unhandled edge cases. Therefore, it meets the problem description's requirements fully.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a list parameter `nested_list`, which can contain integers or additional nested lists. It recursively flattens the input list into a single-level list called `flat_list`, which only contains the integers extracted from `nested_list` and any nested lists within it. The original `nested_list` remains unchanged. The function can handle lists of any depth and efficiently incorporates all integers from nested structures. However, it does not handle non-list or non-integer types in `nested_list`, which means that if any element is a non-list and not an integer, it will be ignored in the flattening process. The function ultimately returns `flat_list`, which is a comprehensive collection of all integers found in the original input, while preserving its structure.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
