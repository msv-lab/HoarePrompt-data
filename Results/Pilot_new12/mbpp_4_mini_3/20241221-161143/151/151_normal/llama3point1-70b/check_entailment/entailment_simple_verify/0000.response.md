Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description and functions as intended, systematically flattening a nested list structure. The original assessment correctly identified that the function utilizes recursion to traverse any level of nested lists, verifying that it effectively appends non-list elements to `flat_list`. The annotations further confirm that `flat_list` correctly accumulates the flattened elements and that the original `nested_list` is unaffected by the operations performed. Therefore, the assessment of the program's correctness remains appropriate and justified by both the analysis of the code and the annotations provided.
