You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists, potentially nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list`, which may include integers from `nested_list` and any integers from nested lists processed by `func_1`; `nested_list` remains unchanged as the original input list.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which is a flattened version of nested_list, including integers from nested_list and any integers from nested lists processed by func_1, while nested_list remains unchanged as the original input list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list parameter `nested_list`, which can contain integers or additional nested lists. It recursively flattens the input list into a single-level list called `flat_list`, which only contains the integers extracted from `nested_list` and any nested lists within it. The original `nested_list` remains unchanged. The function can handle lists of any depth and efficiently incorporates all integers from nested structures. However, it does not handle non-list or non-integer types in `nested_list`, which means that if any element is a non-list and not an integer, it will be ignored in the flattening process. The function ultimately returns `flat_list`, which is a comprehensive collection of all integers found in the original input, while preserving its structure.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
