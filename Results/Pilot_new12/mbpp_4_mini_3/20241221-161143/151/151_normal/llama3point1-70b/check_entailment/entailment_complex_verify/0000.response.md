Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` meets the problem description of flattening a nested list structure. The recursive approach effectively handles any depth of nesting by checking if an element is a list and calling itself on that list until all integers are extracted and gathered into a single-level list, `flat_list`. 

The annotated version further supports this claim, demonstrating that after the for loop, `flat_list` contains all integers from the `nested_list` and any nested lists processed by the function, while the original `nested_list` remains unchanged. The annotations also clarify that non-list and non-integer types are ignored, but the problem description does not require handling those cases. The function satisfies the requirement of flattening a provided valid list input, properly addressing the expected behavior as specified, and thus correctness is confirmed.
