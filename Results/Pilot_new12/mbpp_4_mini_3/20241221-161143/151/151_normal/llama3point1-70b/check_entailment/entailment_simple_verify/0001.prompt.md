You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to flatten a given nested list structure. It employs recursion to handle lists nested at any level of depth. The program iterates through each element of the input list; if an element is itself a list, it recursively calls the function to flatten that list. If an element is not a list, it appends that element to the result list. 

This approach effectively handles:
1. Lists that are entirely flat.
2. Lists that contain other lists, at any level of nesting.
3. Mixed types within the lists (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).

There are no identified edge cases where this logic would fail, as it correctly processes each element regardless of its depth or type. It will return an accurate flattened list for all valid nested list inputs. Thus, the code meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists, potentially nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list`, which may include integers from `nested_list` and any integers from nested lists processed by `func_1`; `nested_list` remains unchanged as the original input list.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which is a flattened version of nested_list, including integers from nested_list and any integers from nested lists processed by func_1, while nested_list remains unchanged as the original input list.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
