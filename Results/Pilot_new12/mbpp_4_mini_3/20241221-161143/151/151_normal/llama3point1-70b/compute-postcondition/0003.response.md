The `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the first element of the `nested_list`, which is a list. Since the exact output of `func_1(i)` is not provided, we cannot determine specific values for `flat_list` after the execution, but it will now include whatever `func_1(i)` returns. The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 element, `flat_list` is updated with the return value of `func_1(i)`, and `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, which is a list.**
