According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least 1 element, it means that there is an element for the loop to process. At the end of the last iteration, `flat_list` has been updated based on the first element of `nested_list`, which is `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must contain at least 2 elements. The next value of `i` will be the second element of `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, `flat_list` is updated with the return value of `func_1(i)` or contains the first element, where `i` is the second element of `nested_list`**
