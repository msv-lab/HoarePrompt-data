The variable `i` is appended to the `flat_list`. The value of `i` is currently the second element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` is modified to include this new element. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` now includes the value of `i` as its new last element.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` now includes `i`.**
