To understand the impact of the code:

- The variable `i` is assigned the value of the second element from `nested_list`.
- The function `func_1(i)` is called with `i` as an argument, returning a value that is then extended to `flat_list`.

Since `nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, we assume `nested_list[1]` is valid and can be passed into `func_1`. As such, `flat_list` gets updated with the return value of `func_1(i)`, which could vary depending on the implementation of `func_1`.

Given that the structure and return value of `func_1` is unspecified, we denote its return value simply as `func_1(i)`.

Thus, the output state after running the code is:

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 elements; `flat_list` is updated with the return value of `func_1(i)` where `i` is the second element of `nested_list`.**
