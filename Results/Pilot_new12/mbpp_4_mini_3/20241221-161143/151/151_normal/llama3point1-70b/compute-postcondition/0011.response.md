According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. The loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, which means it has not yet exhausted all its elements. 

If we consider the nested loop behavior, `i` is currently the first element of the `nested_list` after the first iteration execution. For the next iteration, `i` will be assigned the next element in `nested_list`. Since there are at least 2 elements in the list, that means the loop can still execute as long as `nested_list` has at least 3 elements.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the state must reflect that `i` is now the second element of `nested_list`, and we need to ensure `nested_list` still contains at least 2 elements.

State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, i is now the second element of `nested_list`**.
