Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list parameter `nested_list`, which can contain integers or additional nested lists. It recursively flattens the input list into a single-level list called `flat_list`, which only contains the integers extracted from `nested_list` and any nested lists within it. The original `nested_list` remains unchanged. The function can handle lists of any depth and efficiently incorporates all integers from nested structures. However, it does not handle non-list or non-integer types in `nested_list`, which means that if any element is a non-list and not an integer, it will be ignored in the flattening process. The function ultimately returns `flat_list`, which is a comprehensive collection of all integers found in the original input, while preserving its structure.**
