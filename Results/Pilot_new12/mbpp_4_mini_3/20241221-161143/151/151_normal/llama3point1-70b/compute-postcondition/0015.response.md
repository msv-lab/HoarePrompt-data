To derive the output state, we need to analyze the operation of the provided loop code with respect to the initial state.

Initial State: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists, potentially nested to any depth; `flat_list` is an empty list. 

The loop iterates over each element `i` in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, it processes that list through the function `func_1` and extends `flat_list` with its return value. If `i` is not a list, it appends `i` directly to `flat_list`.

Since the loop can potentially execute multiple times depending on the structure of `nested_list`, the output states after a certain number of iterations are captured. 

When we analyze the full execution of the loop:
- `flat_list` will eventually contain all the elements from `nested_list`, including flattening any nested lists processed by `func_1`.
- If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute at all, leaving `flat_list` empty.

Hence, the output state after all the iterations of the loop should describe the condition that resulted from processing `nested_list`. 

Final Output State: **`flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list`, which may include integers from `nested_list` and any integers from nested lists processed by `func_1`; `nested_list` remains unchanged as the original input list.**
