The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists, potentially nested to any depth. After executing the function body, it returns `flat_list`, which is a flattened version of `nested_list`, including all integers from `nested_list` and any integers from nested lists processed by `func_1`. The original `nested_list` remains unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a nested list as input and return a flattened list containing all integers from the input list and its nested lists while keeping the original structure of the input list intact. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain integers or other lists, and returns a flattened version of nested_list containing all integers without altering the original nested_list.**
