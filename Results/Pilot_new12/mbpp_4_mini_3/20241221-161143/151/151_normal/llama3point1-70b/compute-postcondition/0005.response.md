`flat_list` is updated by appending the current value of `i` to it. Since `i` is the first element in `nested_list` and is not a list itself, `flat_list` now contains one element which is the value of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 element; `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list`, `i` is the first element in `nested_list` and is not a list.**
