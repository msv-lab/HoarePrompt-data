According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nested_list`. If `nested_list` contains at least one element, the loop can execute. The variable `flat_list` being empty does not affect the loop's execution, as it is populated within the loop body. Thus, for the loop to be executed, `nested_list` must contain at least one element, and `i` will be assigned the first element in `nested_list`. 

State: **`nested_list` must contain at least 1 element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`**
