To analyze the impact of the code, we focus on the `flat_list` and how it changes based on the `append` method. The code `flat_list.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of `flat_list`. 

Given the initial state:
- `nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, thus the element `i` is one of the elements from `nested_list` (specifically the second element).
- `flat_list` is either updated with the return value of `func_1(i)` or contains the first element.

Since `flat_list` gets the new element `i` appended to it, the previous version of `flat_list` may or may not remain unchanged if it was initially set, but since it is just appending to it, it keeps all its previous values plus the new one. 

The variable `i` comes from `nested_list` and is updated to represent the second element of this list. However, without knowing the exact contents of `nested_list`, we refer to `i` directly as the second element.

So, the only significant update to the output state will be for `flat_list`, which will now contain one more element as a result of appending `i`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 elements; `flat_list` has the first element and now also includes `i`, the second element of `nested_list`.**
