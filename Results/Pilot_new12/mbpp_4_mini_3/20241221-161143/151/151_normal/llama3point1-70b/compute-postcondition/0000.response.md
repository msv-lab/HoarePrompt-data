The statement initializes `flat_list` as an empty list, but it doesn't modify `nested_list`. Therefore, the output state should reflect only the update to `flat_list`. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists, potentially nested to any depth; `flat_list` is an empty list.**
