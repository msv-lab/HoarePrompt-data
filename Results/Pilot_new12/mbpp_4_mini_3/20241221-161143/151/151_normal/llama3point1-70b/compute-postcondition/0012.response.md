Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact step by step:

- The variable `i` holds the value of the second element of `nested_list`.
- The code uses `func_1(i)` to process `i`, resulting in some output which will be extended into the `flat_list`.
- Because we do not have the details of how `func_1(i)` processes `i`, we refer to the output as `func_1(i)`.

Therefore, there are no changes to `nested_list` or `i`, but `flat_list` will be updated by extending it with the result of `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` is extended with the result of 'func_1(i)'.**
