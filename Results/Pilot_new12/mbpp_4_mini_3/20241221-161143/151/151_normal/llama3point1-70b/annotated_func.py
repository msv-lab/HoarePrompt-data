#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists, potentially nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list`, which may include integers from `nested_list` and any integers from nested lists processed by `func_1`; `nested_list` remains unchanged as the original input list.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which is a flattened version of nested_list, including integers from nested_list and any integers from nested lists processed by func_1, while nested_list remains unchanged as the original input list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list parameter `nested_list`, which can contain integers or additional nested lists. It recursively flattens the input list into a single-level list called `flat_list`, which only contains the integers extracted from `nested_list` and any nested lists within it. The original `nested_list` remains unchanged. The function can handle lists of any depth and efficiently incorporates all integers from nested structures. However, it does not handle non-list or non-integer types in `nested_list`, which means that if any element is a non-list and not an integer, it will be ignored in the flattening process. The function ultimately returns `flat_list`, which is a comprehensive collection of all integers found in the original input, while preserving its structure.
