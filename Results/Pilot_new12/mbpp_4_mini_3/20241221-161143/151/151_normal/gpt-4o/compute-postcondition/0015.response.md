Output State: **`flat_list` contains all elements from `nested_list`, including those extracted from any nested lists via `func_1`, maintaining the original order. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any depth. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains an empty list.**
