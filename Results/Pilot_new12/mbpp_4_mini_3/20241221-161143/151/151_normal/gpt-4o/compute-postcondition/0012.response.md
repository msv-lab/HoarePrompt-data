The `flat_list` will now include the results of `func_1(item)` as it is being extended by whatever `func_1(item)` returns. As per the initial state, we know that if `item` is a list, it contains the result of `func_1(item)`, and if it is not, `flat_list` contains the second item from `nested_list`. We have no specific details about the initial values of `flat_list` or what `func_1(item)` returns, but we do know its state updates based on this operation.

Since `flat_list` is modified by the `extend` operation, the overall state will retain the information about `nested_list`, but we will also reflect the changes for `flat_list`.

Output State: **`flat_list` now contains its previous contents plus the results from `func_1(item)`; `nested_list` must have at least 3 items, and `item` is the third item in `nested_list`.**
