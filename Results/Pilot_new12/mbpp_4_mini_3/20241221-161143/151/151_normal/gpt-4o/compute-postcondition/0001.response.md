According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. For the loop to execute, the `nested_list` must have at least 1 item. Additionally, since `flat_list` is empty before the loop starts and the loop will start iterating from the first item, `item` will be the first element of the `nested_list` if it contains at least one element.

State: **`flat_list` is an empty list, `nested_list` must have at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in `nested_list`**
