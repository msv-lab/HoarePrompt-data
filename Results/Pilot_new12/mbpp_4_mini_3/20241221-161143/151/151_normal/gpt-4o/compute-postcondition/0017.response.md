The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any depth. After executing the function body, it returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements from `nested_list`, including those extracted from any nested lists while maintaining the original order. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` is also an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nested_list` and return a flattened version of that list, preserving the order of elements and handling any nested structures. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list potentially containing integers and other lists, and returns a flattened version of nested_list in the original order. If nested_list is empty, it returns an empty list.**
