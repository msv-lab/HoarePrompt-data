Postcondition: ***`flat_list` contains its previous contents plus the results from `func_1(item)` if `item` is a list. If `item` is not a list, `flat_list` contains the values it had before plus `item`, which is the third item from `nested_list`. Additionally, `nested_list` must have at least 3 items in either case.***
