According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. The loop iterates over each `item` in `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `item` is the first element in `nested_list`, and `nested_list` has at least 1 item. 

To execute the loop one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 items, and `item` must be the second item in `nested_list`. 

State: **`flat_list` is an empty list, `nested_list` must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `nested_list`**
