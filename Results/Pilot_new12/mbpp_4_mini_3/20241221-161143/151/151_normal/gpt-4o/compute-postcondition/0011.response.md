According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 3 items, the loop will execute for the third item. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` must have at least 2 items, and `item` is the second item in `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 items, and `item` must be the third item in that list.

State: **`flat_list` is a list that, if `item` is a list, contains the result of `func_1(item)`. If `item` is not a list, `flat_list` contains the second item from `nested_list`. Additionally, `nested_list` must have at least 3 items, and `item` is the third item in `nested_list`.**
