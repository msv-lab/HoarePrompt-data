The code snippet provided appends `item` to `flat_list`. The current conditions mention that `flat_list` already contains values based on whether `item` is a list or not. Since `item` is the third item in `nested_list`, its value is relevant. After executing `flat_list.append(item)`, the contents of `flat_list` change by adding `item` to it.

Since `item` could either be a list or some other value depending on the structure of `nested_list`, the specific new value of `flat_list` is updated. However, the other variables retain their significance from the initial state.

Output State: **`flat_list` now contains the values it had before plus `item`, where `item` is the third item from `nested_list`, and `nested_list` must have at least 3 items.**
