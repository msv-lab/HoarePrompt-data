The `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)`. Given that `flat_list` is initially empty and `item` is a list (the first item in `nested_list`), the result of `func_1(item)` will determine how `flat_list` gets updated. The variable `nested_list` remains unchanged, and `item` retains its identity as a list.

The impact of the code means that `flat_list` now contains the elements returned by `func_1(item)`, which could be any number of elements depending on the specific implementation of `func_1`.

Output State: **`flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(item)`; `nested_list` has at least 1 item; `item` is a list that is the first item in `nested_list`.**
