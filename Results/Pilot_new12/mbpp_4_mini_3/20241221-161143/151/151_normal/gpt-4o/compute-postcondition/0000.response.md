The code initializes `flat_list` as an empty list. The variable `nested_list` remains unchanged but still retains its capacity to contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, nested to any depth. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any depth; `flat_list` is an empty list.**
