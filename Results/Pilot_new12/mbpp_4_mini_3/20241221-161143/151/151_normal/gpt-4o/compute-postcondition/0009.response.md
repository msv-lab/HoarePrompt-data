After executing the code `flat_list.append(item)`, the `flat_list` will include `item`, which is the second item of the `nested_list`. Since `flat_list` starts as an empty list, it will now contain that specific item.

Output State: **`flat_list` is a list containing the second item from `nested_list`, `nested_list` must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `nested_list`.**
