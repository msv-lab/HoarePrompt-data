#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` contains all elements from `nested_list`, including those extracted from any nested lists via `func_1`, maintaining the original order. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any depth. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains an empty list.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which contains all elements from nested_list, including those extracted from any nested lists via func_1, maintaining the original order. If nested_list is empty, flat_list is also an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a list that can include integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any depth. It returns a flattened version of `nested_list`, where all elements are extracted and presented in a single list while maintaining their original order. In the case where `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function handles arbitrarily nested lists correctly, and no edge cases related to the types of elements or the depth of nesting are missed.
