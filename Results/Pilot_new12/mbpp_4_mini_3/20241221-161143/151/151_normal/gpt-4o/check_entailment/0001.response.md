To evaluate the correctness of the program with respect to the problem description, I will analyze the function `func_1` defined to flatten a given nested list structure.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Base Case:** The function initializes an empty list `flat_list`.
2. **Iteration**: It iterates through each `item` in the provided `nested_list`.
3. **Recursion**: For each `item`, it checks if the `item` is a list using `isinstance(item, list)`.
   - If it is a list, it recursively calls `func_1(item)` and extends the `flat_list` with the results.
   - If it is not a list, it simply appends the `item` to `flat_list`.
4. **Return**: The final `flat_list` is returned after iterating through all the items.

### Test Cases Provided in the Assertion:
1. The function has been tested with various nested lists as assertions, demonstrating it flattens the structure correctly.
2. The examples given suggest that the function behaves as expected with typical nested lists.

### Potential Edge Cases:
I must consider if there are any edge cases not covered by the provided tests:
- **Deeply Nested Lists**: What if the nested lists contain other levels of lists within lists, e.g., `[[[1, 2], [3]], [4, [5, 6]], 7]`?
- **Empty Nested Lists**: Input such as `[[], [], []]`, which should return `[]`.
- **Mixed Types**: Input like `[1, [2, [3, "a"], 4], "b"]`.
- **Completely Flat List**: Input like `[1, 2, 3]`, which should return `[1, 2, 3]` as well.

### Edge Case Evaluation:
Let's evaluate one of the edge cases.

1. **Deeply Nested List**:
   - Considering the input `[[[1, 2], [3]], [4, [5, 6]], 7]`, the expected output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` will correctly flatten this nested structure due to its recursive nature.

2. **Empty Nested Lists**:
   - Input `[[[]]]`: The expected output is `[]`, and the code handles this properly as it will skip empty inner lists.

3. **Mixed Types**:
   - Input `[1, [2, [3, "a"], 4], "b"]`: The expected output is `[1, 2, 3, "a", 4, "b"]`, which the function will also correctly flatten.

4. **Complete Flat List**:
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]` should return `[1, 2, 3]`, which works as per the current logic.

### Conclusion:
After examining the program against various edge cases and validating that they all yield the expected results, I have concluded that the function `func_1` correctly implements the required flattening logic for all potential cases provided.

Correctness: **True**
