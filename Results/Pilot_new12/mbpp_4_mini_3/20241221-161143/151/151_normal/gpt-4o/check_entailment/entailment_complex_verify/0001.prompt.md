You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the program with respect to the problem description, I will analyze the function `func_1` defined to flatten a given nested list structure.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Base Case:** The function initializes an empty list `flat_list`.
2. **Iteration**: It iterates through each `item` in the provided `nested_list`.
3. **Recursion**: For each `item`, it checks if the `item` is a list using `isinstance(item, list)`.
   - If it is a list, it recursively calls `func_1(item)` and extends the `flat_list` with the results.
   - If it is not a list, it simply appends the `item` to `flat_list`.
4. **Return**: The final `flat_list` is returned after iterating through all the items.

### Test Cases Provided in the Assertion:
1. The function has been tested with various nested lists as assertions, demonstrating it flattens the structure correctly.
2. The examples given suggest that the function behaves as expected with typical nested lists.

### Potential Edge Cases:
I must consider if there are any edge cases not covered by the provided tests:
- **Deeply Nested Lists**: What if the nested lists contain other levels of lists within lists, e.g., `[[[1, 2], [3]], [4, [5, 6]], 7]`?
- **Empty Nested Lists**: Input such as `[[], [], []]`, which should return `[]`.
- **Mixed Types**: Input like `[1, [2, [3, "a"], 4], "b"]`.
- **Completely Flat List**: Input like `[1, 2, 3]`, which should return `[1, 2, 3]` as well.

### Edge Case Evaluation:
Let's evaluate one of the edge cases.

1. **Deeply Nested List**:
   - Considering the input `[[[1, 2], [3]], [4, [5, 6]], 7]`, the expected output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` will correctly flatten this nested structure due to its recursive nature.

2. **Empty Nested Lists**:
   - Input `[[[]]]`: The expected output is `[]`, and the code handles this properly as it will skip empty inner lists.

3. **Mixed Types**:
   - Input `[1, [2, [3, "a"], 4], "b"]`: The expected output is `[1, 2, 3, "a", 4, "b"]`, which the function will also correctly flatten.

4. **Complete Flat List**:
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]` should return `[1, 2, 3]`, which works as per the current logic.

### Conclusion:
After examining the program against various edge cases and validating that they all yield the expected results, I have concluded that the function `func_1` correctly implements the required flattening logic for all potential cases provided.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` contains all elements from `nested_list`, including those extracted from any nested lists via `func_1`, maintaining the original order. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any depth. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains an empty list.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which contains all elements from nested_list, including those extracted from any nested lists via func_1, maintaining the original order. If nested_list is empty, flat_list is also an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a list that can include integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any depth. It returns a flattened version of `nested_list`, where all elements are extracted and presented in a single list while maintaining their original order. In the case where `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list. The function handles arbitrarily nested lists correctly, and no edge cases related to the types of elements or the depth of nesting are missed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
