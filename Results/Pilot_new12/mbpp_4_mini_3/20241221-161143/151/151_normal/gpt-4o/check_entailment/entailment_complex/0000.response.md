Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` properly fulfills the requirements of the problem description, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. Here's a breakdown of how the function meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a single parameter `nested_list`, which is assumed to be a list containing integers, other lists, or a combination of both, potentially nested to any depth. The problem description indicates that the input will be valid, which the function is designed to handle.

2. **Recursion**: The function uses a recursive approach to traverse through each element of the list:
   - It iterates through the elements of `nested_list`.
   - If an element is itself a list, it makes a recursive call to `func_1` on that element and extends `flat_list` with the result. This allows it to drill down into all nested lists, regardless of their depth.
   - If an element is not a list (i.e., it is an integer), it simply appends that element to `flat_list`.

3. **Output**: The function returns a single flat list that contains all the elements originally found in `nested_list`, preserving the order of appearance. The description clearly states the requirement to maintain the original order, which the implementation achieves.

4. **Empty Input**: If the input list is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list, as indicated by the program annotations.

5. **Correctness on Provided Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests that confirm the function's correctness:
   - It successfully flattens lists with varying depths and combinations of nested and non-nested elements.
   - All test cases produce the expected output as defined by the problem description.

Because of these points, the function meets the requirements of the problem description and can handle the specified cases correctly. Thus, the conclusion is that the function is correct.
