Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately evaluates the correctness of the program based on the problem description and provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to flatten nested lists, and the annotated code confirms that it effectively does so while maintaining the order of elements. The analysis considers various edge cases, including deeply nested lists, empty lists, and mixed types, and validates that the function performs as expected in all scenarios. Additionally, the annotations reinforce the program's capability to handle valid inputs efficiently. Therefore, I conclude that the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
