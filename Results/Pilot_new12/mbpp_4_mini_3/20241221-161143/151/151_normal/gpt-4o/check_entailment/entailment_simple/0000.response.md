Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(nested_list)` correctly implements the requirement of flattening a given nested list structure, as stated in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Recursive Traversal**: The function uses a recursive approach to traverse each item in the nested list. If an item is a list, it calls itself with that list, effectively searching deeper levels of nesting until it finds non-list items.

2. **Maintains Order**: The use of `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` ensures that the order of elements is preserved. Elements from inner lists are added to `flat_list` in the order they appear in the original `nested_list`.

3. **Handles Various Depths**: The implementation can handle lists nested to any depth due to its recursive design.

4. **Empty List Handling**: If the input `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty `flat_list`, which is appropriate.

5. **Examples**: The function passes all provided test cases, yielding the expected flattened lists for various configurations of nested lists.

In conclusion, the program satisfies the problem description's requirements by correctly flattening nested lists, maintaining the order, and handling empty inputs, which establishes its correctness.
