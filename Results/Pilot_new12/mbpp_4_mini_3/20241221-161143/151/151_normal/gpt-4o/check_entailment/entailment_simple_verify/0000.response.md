Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` successfully flattens the nested lists as required by the problem description. The annotations confirm that the function handles input appropriately, checking if each item is a list and recursively extending the flat list with its contents, while also maintaining the original order of elements. The assertions provided match the expected output, demonstrating the correctness of the logic implemented in the function. Additionally, the program is assumed to only receive valid input, which further supports the correctness of the function as per the problem requirements.
