Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by using recursion. It checks if each item in the input `nested_list` is a list; if it is, it extends the `flat_list` with the result of calling `func_1` on that item. If the item is not a list, it appends the item directly to `flat_list`. 

The assertions provided also confirm the correctness of the function, as the outputs match the expected flattened lists. 

The function should handle all typical edge cases, such as deeply nested lists and mixed types, and produces the expected results based on the examples given. Since I cannot find any input scenario that would cause the function to fail in meeting the problem description, I conclude that the function is correct.
