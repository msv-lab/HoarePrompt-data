Explanation: The program correctly implements a recursive approach to flatten a nested list structure. The function `func_1` checks if an item in the provided `nested_list` is a list; if it is, the function recursively flattens it. If the item is not a list, it appends the item to the `flat_list`. The provided output hints affirm that the function operates as intended by flattening lists of varying depths, and the examples show that it correctly processes a range of nested structures while maintaining the original order of elements.

The function also correctly handles an empty input by returning an empty list, as specified in the output hints. Given that all examples verify the functionality as described without missing any edge cases, the implementation is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**.
