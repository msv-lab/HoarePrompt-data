Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program effectively implements a recursive function to flatten a nested list structure, adhering to the problem description. The function correctly handles cases where the input list is empty and processes nested lists of arbitrary depth, as stated in the output hints. The provided examples in the assertions confirm the expected behavior, yielding the appropriate flattened lists while maintaining the original order of elements. The function seems robust and comprehensive in addressing typical edge cases, which supports the conclusion of correctness.
