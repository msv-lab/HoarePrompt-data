Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure as specified in the problem description. It handles arbitrarily nested lists, extracting all integers while maintaining their original order. 

The implementation leverages recursion to handle nested lists of any depth, effectively ensuring that all elements, regardless of their position in the nested structure, are included in the final flat list. Furthermore, the output hints confirm that the function can handle edge cases like empty lists effectively, returning an empty list if the input is empty. 

Given the provided assertions within the program, the function has been tested against various cases and has returned the expected outputs for all. Thus, it meets the requirements of the problem description comprehensively.
