Functionality: **The function accepts three positive float parameters: b (the base of the triangular prism), h (the height of the triangular base), and l (the length of the prism). It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula (b * h / 2) * l. The function assumes that the provided parameters are positive floats; however, it does not handle cases where the input values are negative or zero, which could lead to incorrect calculations or runtime errors. The function successfully computes the volume as long as the inputs are valid positive floats. Upon completion, the program returns a single float value representing the volume.**
