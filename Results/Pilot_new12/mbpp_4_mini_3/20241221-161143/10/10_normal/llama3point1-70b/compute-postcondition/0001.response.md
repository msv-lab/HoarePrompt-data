The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. Each of these parameters is a positive float, where `b` represents the base of the triangular prism, `h` represents the height of the triangular base, and `l` represents the length of the prism. The function returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated using the formula (b * h / 2) * l. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three positive float parameters representing the dimensions of a triangular prism and return the calculated volume of that prism.

Functionality: **The function accepts positive float parameters b (base of the triangular prism), h (height of the triangular base), and l (length of the prism), and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as (b * h / 2) * l.**
