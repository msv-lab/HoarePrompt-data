The given function calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the provided formula: 

\[
\text{Volume} = \left(\frac{b \times h}{2}\right) \times l
\]

The output hints confirm that the function accepts three positive float parameters (b, h, and l) and returns the volume correctly when valid positive floats are provided. However, it also mentions that the function does not handle cases where the input values may be negative or zero. 

Since the program does not validate the inputs and could potentially return an incorrect volume (for instance, if any of the parameters are zero or negative), this means that it doesn't fulfill the problem description requirements under all potential cases.

Thus, the program does not behave correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
