Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the volume of a triangular prism given the base area (b * h / 2) and the length (l). The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is given by:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} \]

In this case, the base area of the triangle is calculated using (b * h / 2), which is correct, and then it is multiplied by the length (l) of the prism. All potential inputs for base (b), height (h), and length (l) will give the correct volume of the triangular prism as per the formula, confirming the correctness of the program.
