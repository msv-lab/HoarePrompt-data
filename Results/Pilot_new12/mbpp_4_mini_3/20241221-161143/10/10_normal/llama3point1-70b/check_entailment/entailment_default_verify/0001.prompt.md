You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula for the volume, which is given by:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Area of base} \times \text{Length} \]

For a triangular prism, the area of the triangular base can be calculated with:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Thus, the volume of the triangular prism can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l \]

where `b` is the base of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism. The implementation `b * h / 2 * l` correctly reflects this computation.

All potential cases, including scenarios where the base, height, or length are zero or negative, are handled correctly in terms of the mathematical output, as the function is based purely on arithmetic and will output a result consistent with the input values provided. Hence, there are no edge cases that would cause the function to fail given the definition of volume in this context.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three positive float parameters: b (the base of the triangular prism), h (the height of the triangular base), and l (the length of the prism). It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula (b * h / 2) * l. The function assumes that the provided parameters are positive floats; however, it does not handle cases where the input values are negative or zero, which could lead to incorrect calculations or runtime errors. The function successfully computes the volume as long as the inputs are valid positive floats. Upon completion, the program returns a single float value representing the volume.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
