Correctness: **False**

The provided function calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\text{Volume} = \frac{b \cdot h}{2} \cdot l\), which is indeed correct for valid positive float inputs. However, the output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the input values are negative or zero. This indicates that the function may produce invalid results or behave unexpectedly if such inputs are provided, thus failing to meet the problem's requirements for every potential case. 

Since the problem description requires correct handling of all inputs as stated, and the code does not account for negative or zero values, the function is deemed incorrect for these potential edge cases.
