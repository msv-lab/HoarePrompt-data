Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` computes the volume of a triangular prism using the appropriate formula. The annotations confirm that before the function call, `b`, `h`, and `l` are all positive floats, which aligns with the constraints provided in the problem description. This assures that the function performs as expected without any invalid scenarios encountered.

The provided formula for the volume of the triangular prism, \((b \times h / 2) \times l\), is accurate and properly implemented in the function. There are no edge cases that would render the calculation incorrect given the assumption of valid input, which the annotations support.

Therefore, the assessment of correctness remains valid based on the problem description and the annotations provided.
