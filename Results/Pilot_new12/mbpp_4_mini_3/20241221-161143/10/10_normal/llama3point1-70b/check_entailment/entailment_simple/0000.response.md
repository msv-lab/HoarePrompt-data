Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the formula provided in the problem description. 

Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1(b, h, l)` takes three parameters:
   - `b`: the base of the triangular prism (positive float)
   - `h`: the height of the triangular base (positive float)
   - `l`: the length of the prism (positive float)

2. **Correct Formula**: The volume of a triangular prism is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length} = \left(\frac{b \times h}{2}\right) \times l
   \]
   The implemented approach computes the base area as \(\frac{b \times h}{2}\) and then multiplies it by the length \(l\). This formula is mathematically sound for calculating the volume of a prism and matches the expected computation in the problem description.

3. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem states that inputs will be valid (positive floats), which aligns with the assumptions made in the program. Since the program is designed under the assumption of valid inputs, it does not account for any errors or invalid inputs, which is expressly permitted by the problem statement.

Overall, the program adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description and correctly implements the required formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism.
