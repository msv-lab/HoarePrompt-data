Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`, which represent the base of the triangular prism, the height of the triangular base, and the length of the prism, respectively. The function computes the volume using the formula:

\[
\text{Volume} = \left(\frac{b \times h}{2}\right) \times l
\]

This formula is mathematically correct for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, as it derives from finding the area of the triangular base (which is \(\frac{b \times h}{2}\)) and then multiplying that area by the length of the prism (`l`).

Additionally, the program assumes that the input parameters are positive floats and does not include any error handling for invalid inputs, which aligns with the assumption that the user will provide valid inputs as stated in the prompt. Therefore, the implementation meets the requirements set by the problem description and accurately performs the intended calculation.
