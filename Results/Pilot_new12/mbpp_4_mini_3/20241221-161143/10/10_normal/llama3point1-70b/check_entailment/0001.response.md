Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula for the volume, which is given by:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Area of base} \times \text{Length} \]

For a triangular prism, the area of the triangular base can be calculated with:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Thus, the volume of the triangular prism can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times l \]

where `b` is the base of the triangle, `h` is the height of the triangle, and `l` is the length of the prism. The implementation `b * h / 2 * l` correctly reflects this computation.

All potential cases, including scenarios where the base, height, or length are zero or negative, are handled correctly in terms of the mathematical output, as the function is based purely on arithmetic and will output a result consistent with the input values provided. Hence, there are no edge cases that would cause the function to fail given the definition of volume in this context.
