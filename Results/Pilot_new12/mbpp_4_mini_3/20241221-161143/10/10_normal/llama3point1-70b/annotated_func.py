#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive float representing the base of the triangular prism, h is a positive float representing the height of the triangular base, and l is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as (b * h / 2) * l, where b, h, and l are positive floats representing the base, height of the triangular base, and length of the prism respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive float parameters: b (the base of the triangular prism), h (the height of the triangular base), and l (the length of the prism). It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula (b * h / 2) * l. The function assumes that the provided parameters are positive floats; however, it does not handle cases where the input values are negative or zero, which could lead to incorrect calculations or runtime errors. The function successfully computes the volume as long as the inputs are valid positive floats. Upon completion, the program returns a single float value representing the volume.
