The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. All three parameters are positive floats. After executing the function body, it computes the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \( 0.5 \times base \times height \times length \). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept three positive float parameters representing the area of the triangular base, height, and length of the prism, and return the volume of the triangular prism.

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive float parameters (base, height, length) and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated using the formula 0.5 * base * height * length.**
