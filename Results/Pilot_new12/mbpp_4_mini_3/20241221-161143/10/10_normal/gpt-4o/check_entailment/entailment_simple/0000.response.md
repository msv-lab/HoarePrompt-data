Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the functionality required in the problem description, which is to calculate the volume of a triangular prism. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. According to the problem description, these represent the dimensions necessary to calculate the volume of the prism.

2. **Volume Calculation**: The program calculates the area of the triangular base by using the formula `0.5 * base * height`, which is correct. The volume of the triangular prism is then calculated by multiplying the area of the base by the length of the prism: `volume = base_area * length`. This follows the mathematical definition of the volume of a triangular prism, which is indeed `(1/2 * base * height * length)`.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test various cases of the function, checking that it returns the expected volume for given inputs. The expected results (240, 6, and 1) validate that the function is performing correctly.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: As stated, the program assumes valid and positive float inputs, which aligns with the problem description's requirements. Since it does not handle invalid cases, it is still considered correct because we assume that users will provide valid inputs.

In summary, since `func_1` correctly implements the required logic and the program satisfies the problem description's requirements, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
