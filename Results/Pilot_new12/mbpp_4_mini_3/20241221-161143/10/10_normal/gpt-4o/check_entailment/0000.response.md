Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements a function to find the volume of a triangular prism. The formula used for the volume of a triangular prism is correctly applied in the function `func_1`, which calculates the area of the triangular base using the formula 0.5 * base * height and then multiplies this area by the length of the prism. 

The assertions provided in the code cover various cases that confirm the function works correctly:
- For a base of 10, height of 8, and length of 6, it calculates the volume as 240.
- For a base of 3, height of 2, and length of 2, it calculates the volume as 6.
- For a base of 1, height of 2, and length of 1, it calculates the volume as 1.

All the test cases provided confirm that the function works as expected according to the problem description. Further, there are no potential cases that would break the logic of this function, as it handles the calculation based on the mathematical properties of the triangular prism accurately.
