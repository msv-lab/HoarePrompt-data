Correctness: **False**

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism given valid inputs for base, height, and length. However, it does not include any input validation to ensure that all inputs are positive floats. For example, if any of the inputs are negative or zero, the formula will yield incorrect results or might not represent a physical prism. Furthermore, if non-float types are passed, it could lead to errors during multiplication. Thus, while the basic formula is applied correctly, the lack of input validation means the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases. An example where it fails could be `func_1(-1, 2, 3)` which would result in an incorrect negative volume.
