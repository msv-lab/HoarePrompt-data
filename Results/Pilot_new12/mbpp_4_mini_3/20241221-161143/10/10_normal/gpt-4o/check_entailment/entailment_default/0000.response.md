Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function is intended to compute the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length} \), with the base area calculated as \( 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). While the function appears to work correctly for the provided test cases, it lacks input validation. Specifically, it does not check if the inputs (base, height, and length) are positive floats, which could result in incorrect calculations or runtime errors if any negative numbers or non-float types are passed. For example, if a negative value is provided (e.g., `func_1(-10, 5, 3)`), the function would return a negative volume, which is not physically meaningful. Therefore, the absence of input validation leads to the conclusion that the code does not fulfill the problem requirements in every potential case.
