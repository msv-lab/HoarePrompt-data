Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, which represent the necessary dimensions for the calculation of the triangular prism's volume.

Here's why the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Correct Volume Calculation**: The volume of a triangular prism is given by the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The implementation uses `base_area = 0.5 * base * height` to compute the area of the triangular base and then multiplies it by the `length` to determine the volume. This matches the required calculation for the volume.

2. **Input Assumptions**: Although the function does not include explicit checks to validate that inputs are positive floats, the problem description allows us to assume that inputs will always be valid. Therefore, even if invalid inputs might lead to incorrect results if they were present, we are instructed to assume that the inputs adhere to the expected format (positive floats). Thus, under the given constraints, the function behaves correctly.

3. **Output Specifications**: The function returns the computed volume, which aligns with the expectation set by the problem description for what the function must output.

Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description and produces accurate results based on the provided assertions, the overall correctness of the program is affirmed.
