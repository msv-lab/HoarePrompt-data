#State of the program right berfore the function call: base is a positive float representing the area of the triangular base, height is a positive float representing the height of the triangular prism, and length is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(base, height, length):
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is equal to 0.5 * base * height * length, where base is a positive float representing the area of the triangular base, height is a positive float representing the height of the triangular prism, and length is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: base, height, and length, all of which must be positive floats. It calculates the area of the triangular base using the formula \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\) and then calculates the volume of the triangular prism by multiplying the base area by the length of the prism. The function returns the calculated volume, which will also be a positive float, assuming valid inputs. However, there are no checks in place to validate that the inputs are positive floats, which could lead to incorrect calculations or errors if negative values or non-float types are passed. Thus, while the function is intended to compute the volume of a triangular prism based on positive float inputs, it lacks input validation for edge cases.
