Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of numbers (`numbers`), expected to have a length of `N+1`, where `N` is the desired output length of the resulting tuple.

Here's how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Tuple Length**: The function correctly assumes that the input tuple is of length `N+1`, where `N` is determined by the number of adjacent pairs that can be formed from the input.

2. **Tuple Products**: The function uses Python's `zip` function to pair each element of the input tuple with its adjacent successor. Specifically, `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` creates pairs like `(t_1, t_2)`, `(t_2, t_3)`, ..., `(t_N, t_{N+1})`.

3. **Return Value**: The function computes the product of each pair with the expression `a * b` within a generator expression, and the `tuple()` constructor collects these products into a new tuple. The resulting tuple will therefore have length `N`, which is precisely what the problem description requests.

4. **Correctness of Output**: Each element `i` in the output tuple indeed corresponds to `t_i * t_{i+1}`, which follows the requirement specified in the problem description.

Overall, the functionality of the code has been accurately implemented to match the problem description, thus validating its correctness.
