Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the annotations provided. The function `func_1` correctly computes a new tuple that contains the products of adjacent integers from the input tuple `numbers`, which consists of \( N + 1 \) integers. The annotations clarify that the function effectively produces a resultant tuple of length \( N \), as each element is the product of two consecutive integers from the input tuple. 

The assessment also correctly states that edge cases are handled appropriately, specifically noting that if the input contains only one element (leading to an empty result), this is acceptable given the stated requirements. Hence, no discrepancies exist between the program's behavior and the problem description, confirming the function's correctness.
