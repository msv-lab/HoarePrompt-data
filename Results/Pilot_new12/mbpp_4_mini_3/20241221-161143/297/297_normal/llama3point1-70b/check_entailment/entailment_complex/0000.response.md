Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers with length N+1 and correctly returns a new tuple of length N, where each element is the product of adjacent integers from the input tuple.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Specification**: The input is specified as a tuple of N+1 integers. The program handles tuples appropriately without any type errors, as it expects the input in the defined format.

2. **Output Specification**: The program generates a new tuple that contains N elements, where each element is the product of adjacent integers (i.e., the i-th element of the output tuple equals `t_i * t_{i+1}`).

3. **Correct Tuple Generation**: The use of the `zip` function in conjunction with slicing (`numbers[1:]`) effectively pairs each integer with its adjacent counterpart, ensuring that the multiplication is performed correctly for all valid indices.

4. **Edge Case Management**: The function also inherently handles cases where the tuple contains only one element (leading to an empty tuple return), as specified. According to the problem's assumptions about valid inputs, this is an acceptable behavior.

5. **Algorithmic Logic**: The logic of the function operates in a manner that fulfills the requirement without missing any pairs in the tuple.

Overall, since all criteria laid out in the problem description are satisfied and the implementation executes as intended for valid inputs, the correctness is affirmed.
