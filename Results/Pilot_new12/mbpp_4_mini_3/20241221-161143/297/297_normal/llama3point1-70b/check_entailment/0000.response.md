Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(numbers)` correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers as input and produces a tuple of length N, where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function uses the `zip()` function to pair each element with its successor, ensuring that all pairs are used to compute the required products. 

For example:
- Input: `(1, 2, 3, 4)` → Output: `(1*2, 2*3, 3*4)` → `(2, 6, 12)`, which is generated as `(2, 6, 12)`.
- Input: `(0, 1, 2, 3)` → Output: `(0*1, 1*2, 2*3)` → `(0, 2, 6)`, which is also correctly generated.
- Input: `(5, 4)` → Output: `(5*4)` → `(20)`, which is correctly generated.

The function correctly handles edge cases as well, such as when the input contains zeros or negative numbers. Since the expected outputs align perfectly with the logic in the function for all conceivable tuple inputs, the program can be deemed correct.
