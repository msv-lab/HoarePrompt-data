The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

The function `func_1` takes a tuple of N+1 integers and utilizes a generator expression combined with the `zip` function to produce a tuple of size N, consisting of the product of each consecutive pair of integers. The usage of `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` effectively pairs each element with its subsequent neighbor, ensuring that products are computed correctly.

The output hints support the functionality of the code, confirming that edge cases such as a single-element tuple are handled appropriately, resulting in an empty tuple when there are no adjacent integers to multiply.

Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description and handles the outlined edge cases without exceptions, there appear to be no discrepancies.

Correctness: **True**.
