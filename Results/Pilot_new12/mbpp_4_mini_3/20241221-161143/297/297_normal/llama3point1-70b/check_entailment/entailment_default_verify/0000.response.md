Based on the analysis of the problem description, the program's implementation, and the original assessment, the final correctness of the program can be established as follows:

1. **Problem Description**: The function must take a tuple of N+1 numbers and return a tuple of length N, where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple.

2. **Program Implementation**: The program `func_1` correctly implements this by using a generator expression within `tuple()`, which computes the products of consecutive elements using `zip()`. 

3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment states that the correctness is **True** and provides reasoning that aligns with the problem description. It explains how the function handles various inputs correctly, ensuring that all pairs used to compute the required products are accounted for.

4. **Output Hints**: The output hints confirm that the function computes the products of adjacent integers correctly, producing a new tuple of size N. It also notes that the edge cases (such as when there's only one element in the input tuple) are managed correctly, as the function would return an empty tuple, which is expected.

Given that both the program's implementation and the output hints support the observation that the function meets the requirements of the problem description without inconsistencies or logical errors, the original assessment stands justified.

Thus, based on the comprehensive evaluation, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains:

Final: **True**
