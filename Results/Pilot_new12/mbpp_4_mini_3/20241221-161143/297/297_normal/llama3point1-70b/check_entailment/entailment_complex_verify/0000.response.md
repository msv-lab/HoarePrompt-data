Final: **True**

The original assessment that the program is correct aligns well with both the problem description and the provided annotations. The function `func_1(numbers)` accurately implements the requirement of taking a tuple of numbers and returning a tuple of products of adjacent pairs. The use of `zip()` effectively pairs each element with its successor, allowing the correct computation of products.

The annotations clarify that the input is expected to be a tuple of N+1 integers and that the function successfully handles edge cases, such as scenarios where the input tuple might have only one element, resulting in an empty output tuple. These points reinforce the correctness of the function.

Since the program meets the outlined requirements in the problem description and the annotations confirm its intended behavior and handling of edge cases, I maintain that the function is indeed correct. Thus, the final assessment stands as true.
