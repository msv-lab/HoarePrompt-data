Correctness: **True** 

The function `func_1` takes a tuple of `N+1` integers and returns a tuple of length `N` containing the products of adjacent integers from the input tuple. It utilizes `zip` to pair each element with its subsequent element, creating pairs (t_i, t_{i+1}) and then computes their product. 

The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles the scenario where `numbers` contains only one element, as it would result in an empty tuple, which is the expected behavior when there are no adjacent pairs to multiply.

Overall, the logic implemented in the function matches the problem description perfectly for all valid cases, and I did not identify any edge cases or potential failures. Thus, the implementation can be deemed correct.
