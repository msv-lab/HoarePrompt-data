Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and correctly computes a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The use of `zip` with `numbers` and `numbers[1:]` efficiently pairs each element of the input tuple with its next element, and the generator expression multiplies these pairs, producing a new tuple of the desired length \( N \) (where \( N \) is one less than the length of the input tuple).

The program correctly handles the following cases:
1. If the input tuple contains two elements, it returns a tuple with one element as the product of the two.
2. If the input tuple contains three elements, it returns a tuple with two elements as products of the first and second, and second and third.
3. The function will handle tuples with any number of elements greater than one, including negative numbers and zeros.

Since I cannot identify any edge cases or inputs where the program would fail to meet the described requirements, the program is verified to be correct for all potential inputs as defined in the problem description.
