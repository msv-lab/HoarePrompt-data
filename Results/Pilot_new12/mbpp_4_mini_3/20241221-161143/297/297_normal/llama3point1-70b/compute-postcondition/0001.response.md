The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a tuple containing N+1 integers. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent integers from the tuple `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of integers `numbers` and return a tuple with the products of each pair of adjacent integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, a tuple of N+1 integers, and returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent integers in the tuple `numbers`.**
