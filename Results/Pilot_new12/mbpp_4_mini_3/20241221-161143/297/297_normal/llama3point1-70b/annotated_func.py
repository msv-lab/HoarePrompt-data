#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a tuple of N+1 integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of adjacent integers in the tuple 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a tuple of N+1 integers. It returns a new tuple containing the products of adjacent integers from the input tuple `numbers`. Specifically, it computes the product of each pair of consecutive integers in `numbers`, producing a tuple of size N. Edge cases such as when `numbers` contains only one element (resulting in an empty tuple return) are managed correctly, as there are no adjacent integers to multiply. Therefore, the final state of the program will include a tuple with N products, where N is one less than the number of elements in the input tuple.
