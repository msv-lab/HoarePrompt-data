Explanation: The function correctly implements the logic to multiply each consecutive pair of numbers in the input tuple `t`, and returns a new tuple containing these products. The output hints align with the code, confirming that the function accepts a tuple of numbers with a length of N+1 and returns a new tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of numbers. It also correctly handles the case where the input tuple has a length of 1 by returning an empty tuple, which shows it appropriately accounts for the lack of pairs to multiply.

All provided test cases produce correct outputs, and since there are no identified edge cases that the function fails to handle, I conclude that the function does meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
