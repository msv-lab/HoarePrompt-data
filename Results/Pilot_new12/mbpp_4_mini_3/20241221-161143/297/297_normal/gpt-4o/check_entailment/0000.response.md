To evaluate the program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and determine if it produces the expected results based on the input tuple.

**Problem description:** The function should take a tuple of numbers `(t_1,...,t_{N+1})` and return a tuple of length `N`, where the `i-th` element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

**Program code:**
```python
def func_1(t):
    return tuple((t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)))
```

### Analysis

1. **Input Edge Cases**:
   - If the input tuple has only one element (e.g., `(12,)`), the function correctly returns an empty tuple `()`, which matches the intended output as there are no pairs to multiply.
   
2. **General Cases**:
   - For tuples like `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the function calculates:
     - `1 * 5 = 5`
     - `5 * 7 = 35`
     - `7 * 8 = 56`
     - `8 * 10 = 80`
     - The result is `(5, 35, 56, 80)` which is correct.
   - Other test cases provided in assertions also yield correct outputs, confirming that the function behaves as expected.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The function iterates through the tuple and computes the products of adjacent elements correctly using the extending range `len(t) - 1`.

### Conclusion
All the checked inputs produce the expected output as per the problem description. There are no potential edge cases or logic errors in the function that could lead to incorrect results for valid tuples. 

Thus, the function is correct for all examined cases.

Correctness: **True**.
