Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers (of length N+1) and returns a new tuple of length N, where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The implementation correctly follows the requirements specified in the problem description and passes all the assertions provided.

Key points confirming correctness:
- When the tuple length is 1 (N=0), the function correctly returns an empty tuple, as there are no pairs to multiply.
- For input tuples of length greater than 1, it correctly computes the products of consecutive pairs, which is demonstrated in the assertions.

Since the code handles all specified cases and adheres to the conditions of the problem without any identified edge cases where it fails, it is deemed correct.
