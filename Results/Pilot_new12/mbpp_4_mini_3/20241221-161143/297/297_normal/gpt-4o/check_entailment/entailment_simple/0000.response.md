Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(t)` takes a tuple `t` of numbers with length \(N + 1\) (where \(N\) is a non-negative integer) and returns a new tuple of length \(N\). Each element of the returned tuple is the product of consecutive pairs from the input tuple. 

Here's how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes valid input, and the function is designed to handle tuples of length \(N + 1\). It's established that \(N\) is a non-negative integer. Therefore, if `t` has only one element (as in the case `func_1((12,))`), it correctly returns an empty tuple `()` as needed.

2. **Computing the Output**: The function uses a list comprehension that iterates over indices from `0` to `len(t) - 2`, calculating the product of each number with its following number (i.e., \(t[i] \times t[i + 1]\)). This produces exactly the outputs specified in the problem description.

3. **Output Length**: The length of the output tuple is \(N\), which is one less than the length of the input tuple \(N + 1\). Therefore, the output is always correct in terms of length.

Each of the examples provided in the assertions validates that the function is producing the expected results, thereby confirming its correctness concerning the problem requirements. 

Since the function correctly processes any valid input as described, and the results align perfectly with the requirements, we can confidently state that the program is correct.
