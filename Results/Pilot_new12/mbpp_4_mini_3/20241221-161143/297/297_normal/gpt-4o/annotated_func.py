#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of numbers from the tuple 't', where 't' has a length of N+1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer. It returns a new tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of numbers from `t`. If the input tuple has a length of 1 (where N is 0), the function returns an empty tuple since there are no pairs to multiply.
