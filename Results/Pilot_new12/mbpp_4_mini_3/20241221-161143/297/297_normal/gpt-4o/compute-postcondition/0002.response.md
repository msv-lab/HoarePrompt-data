Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `t` of numbers with length N+1, where N is a non-negative integer. It returns a new tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of numbers from `t`. If the input tuple has a length of 1 (where N is 0), the function returns an empty tuple since there are no pairs to multiply.**
