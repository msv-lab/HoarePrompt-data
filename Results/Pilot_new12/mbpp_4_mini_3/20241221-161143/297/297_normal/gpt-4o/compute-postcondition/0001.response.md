The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a tuple of numbers with a length of N+1, where N is a non-negative integer. The function returns a tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of numbers from the tuple `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `t` of numbers and return a tuple of products of each consecutive pair of those numbers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of numbers `t`, and returns a tuple containing the products of each consecutive pair of numbers from `t`.**
