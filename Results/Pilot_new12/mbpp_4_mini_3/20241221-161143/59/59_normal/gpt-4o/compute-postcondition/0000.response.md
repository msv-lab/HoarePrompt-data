The variable `combined_list` is assigned the value of `list1 + list2 + list3`, which means it contains all the integers from those three lists concatenated together. The states of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are not directly affected, so they remain as lists of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of integers; `combined_list` is a concatenated list of integers formed from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.

Output State: **`list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of integers; `combined_list` is a concatenated list of integers formed from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.**
