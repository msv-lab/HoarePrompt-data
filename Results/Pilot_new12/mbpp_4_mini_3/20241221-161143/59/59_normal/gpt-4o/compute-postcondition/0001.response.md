The variable `sorted_list` is assigned the sorted version of `combined_list`, which itself is formed by concatenating `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. The original lists remain unchanged, but `sorted_list` now contains the integers from these lists in sorted order. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged lists and the new sorted list.

Output State: **`list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of integers; `combined_list` is a concatenated list of integers formed from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`; `sorted_list` is a sorted version of `combined_list`.**
