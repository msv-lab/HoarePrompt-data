Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are all lists of integers. It concatenates these three lists into a single list, then sorts this combined list in ascending order. The final output of the function is the sorted list. The function does not handle cases where the input lists may be empty, but in such scenarios, it will return an empty list as the sorted result. No validation of input types is performed, so if non-list or non-integer types are provided, this may lead to unexpected behavior during execution.**
