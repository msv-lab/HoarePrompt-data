The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. All three parameters are lists of integers. The function returns the sorted version of a new list that is formed by concatenating `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers and return a single sorted list that contains all the integers from these lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: list1, list2, and list3, all of which are lists of integers, and returns the sorted version of the concatenated list formed from those three lists.**
