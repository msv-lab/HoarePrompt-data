Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` successfully merges three lists and returns a single sorted list. It combines the three input lists into one and then sorts the combined list using the built-in `sorted()` function, which works as expected in all tested scenarios. 

The provided assertions test various cases, including lists of varying lengths and with duplicate elements, and all return the correct sorted output.

I cannot find any cases where the program does not meet the problem description's requirement to merge three lists into a single sorted list, confirming that the implementation is correct.
