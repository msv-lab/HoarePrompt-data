Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list by concatenating the input lists and applying the `sorted()` function, which works correctly as evidenced by the provided assertions. The output hints clarify that while the function does not explicitly handle empty lists or non-list inputs, it will still return reasonable results in those cases by either returning an empty list or leading to an error if incompatible types are supplied. Since the problem description assumes valid input, the function behaves as expected and satisfies the original requirements presented. Thus, the correctness of the implementation is upheld.
