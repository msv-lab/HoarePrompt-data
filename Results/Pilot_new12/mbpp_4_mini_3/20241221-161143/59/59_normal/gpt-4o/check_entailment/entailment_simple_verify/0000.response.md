Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` takes three lists, merges them into one combined list, and then uses the `sorted()` function to return a new list that is sorted. The annotations provided support this behavior, showing that before the function call, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are indeed lists of integers, thus meeting the problem requirements.

The provided test cases, which include a variety of scenarios such as lists with duplicate elements, already sorted lists, and lists in descending order, all yield the expected sorted results. This thorough coverage indicates that the function behaves correctly under the assumptions made regarding input validity.

Overall, the program meets the specifications outlined in the problem description and performs correctly for the provided test cases. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
