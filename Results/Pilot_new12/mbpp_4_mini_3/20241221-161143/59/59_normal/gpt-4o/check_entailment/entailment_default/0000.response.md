Explanation: The code is designed to merge three lists and return a single sorted list. The approach of concatenating the lists and then using the built-in `sorted()` function appears to work correctly for the provided test cases. According to the output hints, the program handles cases where the input lists may be empty and still returns an empty list as the sorted result, consistent with the problem description. Furthermore, since the task specifies that the inputs will always be valid, we do not need to consider cases for non-list or non-integer types. Therefore, given that the examples demonstrate that the function produces the correct output, it is reasonable to conclude that the code adheres to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
