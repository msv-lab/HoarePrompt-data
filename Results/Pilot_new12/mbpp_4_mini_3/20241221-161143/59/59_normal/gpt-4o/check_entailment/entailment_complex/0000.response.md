Correctness: **True**

The provided program function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to merge three lists into a single sorted list. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Concatenation of Lists**: The function takes three lists as input parameters (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) and concatenates them into a single list using the `+` operator. This ensures that all elements from the three lists are combined into one list.

2. **Sorting the Combined List**: After concatenation, the function sorts the combined list using the built-in `sorted()` function. This sorts the elements in ascending order, as required by the problem description.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the sorted list, which satisfies the requirement of producing a single sorted list from the input lists.

4. **Handling Various Inputs**: The program does not impose restrictions on the input (validity of types and values), and according to the given assumptions, it is considered that valid input will always be provided (lists of integers). Therefore, even if the program does not handle empty lists explicitly, it will correctly return an empty list if all inputs are empty.

5. **Tests Against Examples**: The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases that demonstrate the function's correctness. For each test case, `func_1` produces the expected sorted output.

Since all aspects of the function align with the problem description and the assumptions about valid inputs, the program is confirmed to be correct.

In conclusion, the function successfully merges three lists into a single sorted list for all expected valid cases. Hence, the output is justified as Correctness: **True**.
