Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement, which is to merge three lists into a single sorted list. Analyzing the program and its annotated version shows that:

1. The function `func_1()` takes three lists as input, merges them using `list1 + list2 + list3`, and then sorts the combined list using the `sorted()` function.
2. The provided assertions verify that the function produces the expected output for various scenarios, including handling duplicates, sorted lists, and lists in descending order.
3. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and confirm that the function behaves as intended by returning a sorted list from the merged input lists.
4. The original assessment accurately reflects these findings, correctly stating that the output matches the expected results and that the program satisfies the requirements of the problem description.

Since the results are as expected and all provided test cases pass, the original assessment of correctness is maintained and justified. Thus, the final assessment is that the program is correct.
