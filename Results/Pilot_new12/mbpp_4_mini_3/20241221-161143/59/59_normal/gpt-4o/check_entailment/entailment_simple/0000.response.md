Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to merge three lists into a single sorted list. 

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Merging the Lists**: The program concatenates the three provided lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) using the `+` operator. This effectively combines all elements from the input lists into one single list.

2. **Sorting the Combined List**: The combined list is then sorted using the `sorted()` function in Python, which returns a new list containing all the elements from the combined list in ascending order.

3. **Return Value**: The sorted list is correctly returned from the function, providing the desired output in accordance with the problem description.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function has been tested with various input scenarios and outputs the expected results.

Since the program handles the merging and sorting of the lists as specified in the problem description and has been validated using test cases, it meets all outlined requirements. Therefore, the correctness of this program is affirmed.
