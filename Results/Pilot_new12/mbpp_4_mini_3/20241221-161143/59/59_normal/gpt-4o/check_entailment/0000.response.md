Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It does this by combining the three input lists into one using concatenation, and then sorting the combined list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. 

The provided test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements, lists that are already sorted, and lists that are in descending order. In each of these cases, the output matches the expected sorted list. 

Since no edge cases or unexpected inputs would cause the program to fail to produce the correct sorted result, the program meets the problem description's requirements.
