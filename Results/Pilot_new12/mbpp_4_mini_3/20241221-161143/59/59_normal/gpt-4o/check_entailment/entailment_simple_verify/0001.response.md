Final: **True**

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment that the function `func_1` is correct in merging three lists into a single sorted list. The function performs the merging by concatenating the input lists and then sorts them with the built-in `sorted()` function. The specific assertions verify the correctness of the function's output against expected results for various input cases, including those with duplicates and differing lengths. 

The state of the program before the function calls confirms that the inputs (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) are indeed lists of integers, reaffirming the assumptions made in the original assessment. Since all the assertions pass without any discrepancies, it aligns with the problem description, confirming that the implementation meets the specified requirements. Therefore, there is no evidence in the annotations or the assertions that contradicts the correctness of the program.
