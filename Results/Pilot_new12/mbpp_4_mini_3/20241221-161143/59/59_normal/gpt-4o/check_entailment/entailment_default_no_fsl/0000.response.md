Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, concatenates them, and sorts the resulting list in ascending order. According to the problem description, the function is required to merge these three lists into a single sorted list, which it does correctly. 

The provided output hints indicate that the function will return an empty list when all input lists are empty, which is also a valid output aligned with the problem description. Moreover, the hints note that there is no input validation for types, but as per the stated assumptions, we consider that the inputs will be valid lists of integers.

Since the function performs correctly for all tested cases and handles the provided scenarios appropriately without any issues, I conclude that the function meets the requirements defined in the problem description for every potential case.
