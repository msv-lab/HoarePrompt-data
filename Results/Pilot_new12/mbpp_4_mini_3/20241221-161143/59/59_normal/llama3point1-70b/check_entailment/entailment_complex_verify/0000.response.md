Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` achieves the task described in the problem statement, which is to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The annotated code clarifies that the function concatenates the input lists and sorts them, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description. 

While the annotation notes the potential for exceptions due to non-comparable elements or mixed data types, the assumption that valid input will be provided means that these concerns do not affect the correctness of the core functionality as per the problem description. Therefore, the program satisfies the stipulated requirement, and the original assessment remains accurate.
