Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list by using the `sorted()` function on the concatenated lists. This approach ensures that all elements from the three input lists are included in the output, and the result is sorted in ascending order. Since no edge cases or incorrect behaviors are evident for any potential inputs, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
