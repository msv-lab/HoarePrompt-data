Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as outlined in the problem description and output hints. Specifically, it lacks error handling for non-comparable elements and mixed data types within the input lists. For example, if `list1` contains integers, `list2` contains strings, and `list3` contains floats, the sorting operation will raise a `TypeError`. Thus, for inputs that contain non-comparable elements, the program will not work correctly, which makes it incorrect according to the requirement of handling every potential case.
