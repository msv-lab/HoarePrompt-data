Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the requirement of the problem description which states that it must merge three lists into a single sorted list. 

Here's how the program fulfills the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input parameters. It assumes the input is valid as per the assumption made in the problem description. 

2. **Merging Lists**: The expression `list1 + list2 + list3` concatenates these three lists into one combined list. 

3. **Sorting the Combined List**: The built-in Python function `sorted()` takes this concatenated list and returns a new list that contains the elements sorted in ascending order.

4. **Final Output**: The function finally returns this sorted list.

Given that all steps necessary to fulfill the requirement of merging and sorting the three lists are correctly implemented, the program meets the problem description's requirements. Thus, the answer is True.
