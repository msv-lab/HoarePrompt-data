Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input parameters, concatenates them, and returns a sorted list of all the combined elements. 

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function aims to merge three lists into a single sorted list, which is explicitly consistent with the problem description.

2. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to accept three lists, which meets the input criteria given in the problem description.

3. **Sorting**: The use of the `sorted()` function correctly sorts the concatenated list elements in ascending order and returns a new sorted list, ensuring that the output is always sorted.

4. **Edge Cases**: While the function does not handle specific edge cases robustly (like mixed data types), as per the assumption mentioned (that valid input will be provided), this does not affect the correctness concerning the requirement to merge and sort the lists.

Therefore, given all valid inputs, `func_1` will always produce the expected output as described in the problem description. This confirms that the program is correct.
