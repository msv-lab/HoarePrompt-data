Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly merges the three provided lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) and returns a sorted list. The implementation utilizes the `sorted()` function effectively on the concatenated list, ensuring that all elements are included and sorted in ascending order. 

The annotations confirm that the program handles the input lists as expected and that the return value is indeed a sorted combination of all elements from the three lists. Since the assumption is made that valid input will always be provided (i.e., the inputs will be lists containing comparable elements), there are no edge cases or erroneous conditions that would undermine the correctness of the program as per the problem description. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to maintain that the program meets the requirements.
