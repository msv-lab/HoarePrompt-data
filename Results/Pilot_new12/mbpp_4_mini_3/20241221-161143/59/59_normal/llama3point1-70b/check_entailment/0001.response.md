Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three input lists and returns a single sorted list. The behavior of the program can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Combining Lists**: The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the three lists, which is an appropriate method to combine them into a single list.

2. **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is then called on the combined list. The `sorted()` function efficiently sorts the list in ascending order.

3. **Edge Cases**: The implementation handles edge cases such as:
   - All three input lists being empty, resulting in an empty sorted list.
   - One or more lists containing duplicate values, which will be sorted correctly.
   - Varying lengths of lists, where any combination (including empty and non-empty) will still yield a sorted output.

Because the logic properly merges and sorts any combination of three lists, there are no potential cases where it would fail to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct based on the provided criteria.
