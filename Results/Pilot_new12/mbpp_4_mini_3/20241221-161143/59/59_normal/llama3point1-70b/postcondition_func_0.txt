The function `func_1` takes three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists that may contain integers or other comparable elements. It concatenates these three lists into a single list and returns a new list containing all the combined elements sorted in ascending order. Potential edge cases include handling empty lists, lists with non-comparable elements, and lists with mixed data types, which could raise exceptions during sorting. The function does not include any error handling for such cases.
