#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists that may contain integers or other comparable elements.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list that contains the combined elements of list1, list2, and list3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists that may contain integers or other comparable elements. It concatenates these three lists into a single list and returns a new list containing all the combined elements sorted in ascending order. Potential edge cases include handling empty lists, lists with non-comparable elements, and lists with mixed data types, which could raise exceptions during sorting. The function does not include any error handling for such cases.
