#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sum` is equal to the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum which is equal to the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even i from 0 to n, where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer parameter `n` and computes the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` in the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The final output is the calculated sum, which may be zero if `n` is 0 since the only even integer in that case is 0, resulting in `math.comb(n, 0)` being computed. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer; thus, calling it with non-positive integers could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The final output reflects the sum of these specific binomial coefficients.
