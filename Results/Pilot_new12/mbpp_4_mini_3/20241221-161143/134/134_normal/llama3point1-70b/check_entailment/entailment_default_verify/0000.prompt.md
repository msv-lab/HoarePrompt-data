You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
    return sum


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program computes the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a positive integer \( n \). The logic of iterating through all possible indices from 0 to \( n \) and summing the coefficients at even indices is sound and correctly implemented using `math.comb(n, i)`.

To verify:

1. For \( n = 0 \), the only coefficient is \( C(0, 0) \) which is 1, and it is at an even index.
2. For \( n = 1 \), the coefficients are \( C(1, 0) = 1 \) and \( C(1, 1) = 1 \). The program sums \( C(1, 0) \), giving 1, which is correct.
3. For \( n = 2 \), the coefficients are \( C(2, 0) = 1, C(2, 1) = 2, C(2, 2) = 1 \). The program sums \( C(2, 0) + C(2, 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
4. Continuing this for larger values of \( n \), the function correctly sums coefficients only from even indices.

The program is correctly operating according to the problem description without any edge cases failing. Therefore, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer parameter `n` and computes the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` in the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The final output is the calculated sum, which may be zero if `n` is 0 since the only even integer in that case is 0, resulting in `math.comb(n, 0)` being computed. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer; thus, calling it with non-positive integers could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The final output reflects the sum of these specific binomial coefficients.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
