Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single positive integer `n`, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **Logic for Summing Binomial Coefficients**: 
   - The program uses a loop to iterate from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
   - It checks if the current index `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`).
   - For every even index `i`, it computes the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the cumulative `sum`.

3. **Return Value**: After iterating through all indices, the function returns the `sum` which contains the cumulative value of all even index binomial coefficients from `math.comb(n, i)` for even values of `i` ranging from 0 to `n`.

Thus, the function perfectly aligns with the requirement to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients, confirming that it operates correctly as per the problem description.
