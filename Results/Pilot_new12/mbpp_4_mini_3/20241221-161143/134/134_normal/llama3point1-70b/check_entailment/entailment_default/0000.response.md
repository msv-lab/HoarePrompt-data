Explanation: The code looks correct and follows the problem description closely. The function correctly computes the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` within the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The output hints further clarify that when `n` is 0, the function will compute `math.comb(0, 0)` which evaluates to 1, thus returning the correct sum of even index binomial coefficients. The potential issue mentioned in the hints about handling non-positive integers does not affect the correctness of the program since the problem description explicitly states that it takes in a positive integer. Therefore, we can conclude that the program meets the requirements and behaves as specified for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
