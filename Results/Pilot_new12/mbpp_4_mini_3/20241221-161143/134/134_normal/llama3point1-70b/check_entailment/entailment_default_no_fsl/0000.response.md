Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the problem description as it implicitly assumes that the input `n` will always be a positive integer. If `n` is 0, it will correctly compute the sum as `math.comb(0, 0)`, which is 1. However, if `n` is a negative integer, the behavior is undefined since the range in the for loop will not execute, resulting in a sum of 0, which is likely not the intended behavior for negative inputs. The problem description specifically states that it only accepts positive integers, but it does not specify how the program should behave for edge cases such as `n = 0` or negatives. According to the output hints, there is a risk of unexpected behavior if `n` is not a positive integer, indicating that the function is not entirely robust. 

Additionally, the problem does not indicate what to do in the cases where an invalid input is provided; thus, the program does not correctly fulfill the requirements across all potential scenarios. Having a well-defined behavior for every scenario, including edge cases, is essential for correctness.
