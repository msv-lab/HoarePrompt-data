Correctness: **True**.

The given program computes the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a positive integer \( n \). The logic of iterating through all possible indices from 0 to \( n \) and summing the coefficients at even indices is sound and correctly implemented using `math.comb(n, i)`.

To verify:

1. For \( n = 0 \), the only coefficient is \( C(0, 0) \) which is 1, and it is at an even index.
2. For \( n = 1 \), the coefficients are \( C(1, 0) = 1 \) and \( C(1, 1) = 1 \). The program sums \( C(1, 0) \), giving 1, which is correct.
3. For \( n = 2 \), the coefficients are \( C(2, 0) = 1, C(2, 1) = 2, C(2, 2) = 1 \). The program sums \( C(2, 0) + C(2, 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
4. Continuing this for larger values of \( n \), the function correctly sums coefficients only from even indices.

The program is correctly operating according to the problem description without any edge cases failing. Therefore, it is considered correct.
