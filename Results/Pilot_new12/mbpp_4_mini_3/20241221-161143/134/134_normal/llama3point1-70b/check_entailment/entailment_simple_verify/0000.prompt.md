You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
    return sum


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program computes the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a positive integer \( n \). The logic of iterating through all possible indices from 0 to \( n \) and summing the coefficients at even indices is sound and correctly implemented using `math.comb(n, i)`.

To verify:

1. For \( n = 0 \), the only coefficient is \( C(0, 0) \) which is 1, and it is at an even index.
2. For \( n = 1 \), the coefficients are \( C(1, 0) = 1 \) and \( C(1, 1) = 1 \). The program sums \( C(1, 0) \), giving 1, which is correct.
3. For \( n = 2 \), the coefficients are \( C(2, 0) = 1, C(2, 1) = 2, C(2, 2) = 1 \). The program sums \( C(2, 0) + C(2, 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
4. Continuing this for larger values of \( n \), the function correctly sums coefficients only from even indices.

The program is correctly operating according to the problem description without any edge cases failing. Therefore, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sum` is equal to the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum which is equal to the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even i from 0 to n, where n is a positive integer.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
