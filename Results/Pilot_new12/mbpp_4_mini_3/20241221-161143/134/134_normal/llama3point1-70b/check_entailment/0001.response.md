Correctness: **True**

The program correctly computes the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. It iterates over all indices from `0` to `n`, and for each even index `i`, it adds the corresponding binomial coefficient computed using `math.comb(n, i)`. The logic adheres to the problem description and accounts for all potential cases since it properly handles all values of `i` that are even, including the case where `n` is `0`, which also satisfies the requirement for a positive integer input. 

The binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` is well-defined for non-negative integers and `n >= 0`, and the summation correctly captures only the coefficients at even indices. No edge cases leading to incorrect behavior were identified. Thus, the implementation is correct for all non-negative integers `n`.
