Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the function step-by-step in relation to the task:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n)` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. According to the problem description, the function aims to compute the sum of the binomial coefficients indexed by even integers up to `n`.

2. **Sum Initialization**: The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which is appropriate as the function is intended to accumulate the binomial coefficients. 

3. **For Loop**: The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n` inclusive (`for i in range(n + 1)`). This correctly covers all integers from 0 to `n`.

4. **Checking Even Indices**: Inside the loop, the program checks if `i` is even with `if i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is indeed even, it computes the binomial coefficient using `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to `sum`.

5. **Returning the Result**: After the loop completes, the function returns the cumulative sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function is designed to work correctly for the minimum valid input case (e.g., `n=1`, where the only even index is 0). Even if `n` is 0, it properly computes the sum of coefficients for the range defined, although technically, zero isn't considered a positive integer, but per the assumption stated, we only expect valid positive integers.

Overall, the function fulfills the requirement to compute the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices as outlined in the problem description. There are no scenarios in which it deviates from the specified functionality when provided valid input.
