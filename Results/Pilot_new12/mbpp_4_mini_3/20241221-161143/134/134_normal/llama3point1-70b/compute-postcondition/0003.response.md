`sum` is updated to be the current value of `sum` plus the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is an even integer (and initially 0), the value of `math.comb(n, 0)` is 1 (since it represents the number of ways to choose 0 items from `n`, which is always 1). Therefore, `sum` becomes `0 + 1`, which is 1. The state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged after the execution. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 0, and `i` is an even integer (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`)**.
