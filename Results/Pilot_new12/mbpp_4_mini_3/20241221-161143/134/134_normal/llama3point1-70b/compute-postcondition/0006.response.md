`sum` is updated to `sum + math.comb(n, i)`. Since `sum` is initially 1, and `math.comb(n, i)` calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time, specifically `math.comb(n, 1)` which is equal to `n` (because there are `n` ways to choose 1 item from `n` items). Therefore, the new value of `sum` is `1 + n`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at the value of 1. The output will reflect the new value of `sum`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is `1 + n`, `i` is 1**
