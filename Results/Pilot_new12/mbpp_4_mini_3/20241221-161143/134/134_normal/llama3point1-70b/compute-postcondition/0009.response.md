To determine the output state after the execution of the given code snippet, let's first analyze the variables in the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `sum` is `1 + n`.
- `i` is 2.

The code snippet provided is:
```
sum += math.comb(n, i)
```

`math.comb(n, i)` computes the binomial coefficient "n choose i", which is the number of ways to choose `i` elements from a set of `n` elements. Specifically, since `i` is `2`, it calculates the number of ways to choose `2` elements from `n`.

The calculation affects the variable `sum`. Since `sum` initially equals `1 + n`, the updated value of `sum` after the execution will be:

`sum = sum + math.comb(n, 2)`
`sum = (1 + n) + math.comb(n, 2)`

The state of the other variables (`n` and `i`) does not change. Therefore, the output state, which includes the updated value of `sum`, will be:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `sum` is `1 + n + math.comb(n, 2)`; `i` is 2**.
