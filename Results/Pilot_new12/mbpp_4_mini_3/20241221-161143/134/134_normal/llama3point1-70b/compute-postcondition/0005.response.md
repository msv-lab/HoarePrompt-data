According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 1.

At this point, we know:
- `sum` remains unchanged at this point since it is dependent on the iterations for evaluating when `i` is even or odd.
- `n` remains a positive integer.

For the loop to execute another iteration, `i` needs to be 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, it must still be greater than or equal to 1 to accommodate one more iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 1**
