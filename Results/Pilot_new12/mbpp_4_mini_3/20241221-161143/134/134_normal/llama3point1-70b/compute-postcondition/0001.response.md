According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` ranging from 0 to `n` (inclusive) because of the `range(n + 1)`. Therefore, `n` being a positive integer ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Specifically, the loop will start with `i` initialized to 0 at the beginning of the first iteration and will increment on each successive iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following conditions need to be established: 
- `n` is a positive integer (which it is, as per the given state), 
- `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
