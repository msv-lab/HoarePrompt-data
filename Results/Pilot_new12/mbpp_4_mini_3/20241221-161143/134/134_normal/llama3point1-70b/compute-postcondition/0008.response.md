According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For this loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1, which will make `i` equal to 2. As long as `n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 2), the loop can execute again.

Therefore, the adjustments to the state at the beginning of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be 2 after the increment,
- `sum` will remain 1 if `i` is odd or will have been updated to `1 + n` if `i` is even. 

However, since we're looking at the state before the next iteration, and given that `i` will become 2, which is even, `sum` will be updated to `1 + n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is `1 + n`, `i` is 2**
