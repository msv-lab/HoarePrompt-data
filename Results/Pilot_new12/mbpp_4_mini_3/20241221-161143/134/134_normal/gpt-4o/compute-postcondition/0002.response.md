Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and computes 2 raised to the power of (n - 1). It returns this value, which is always a positive integer. This function does not handle cases where `n` may be zero or negative, and thus assumes that `n` is strictly greater than 0 as per the initial condition stated. The function's primary action is to perform the exponentiation calculation.**
