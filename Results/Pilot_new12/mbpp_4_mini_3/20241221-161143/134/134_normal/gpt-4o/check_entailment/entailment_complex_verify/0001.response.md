Based on the information provided including the problem description, original assessment, and annotated code, I will analyze the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires that the function computes the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given positive integer \( n \). The expected behavior of the function is to return the correct sum of these coefficients, which can be computed using the combination formulas \( C(n, k) \) for \( k \) being even.

Upon reviewing the assertions made against the function `func_1`:

1. For \( n = 4 \):
   - Expected sum: \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7 \)
   - Actual output: \( func_1(4) = 2^3 = 8 \) (this is incorrect)

2. For \( n = 6 \):
   - Expected sum: \( C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) = 1 + 15 + 15 = 31 \)
   - Actual output: \( func_1(6) = 2^5 = 32 \) (this is incorrect)

3. For \( n = 2 \):
   - Expected sum: \( C(2, 0) = 1 \)
   - Actual output: \( func_1(2) = 2^1 = 2 \) (this is incorrect)

Thus, in all provided assertions for \( n = 4, 6, 2 \), the function returns values that are not equal to the required sum of even index binomial coefficients. The original assessment correctly identified these discrepancies and concluded that the function does not meet the expectations laid out in the problem description.

The annotated code further confirms that `func_1` computes \( 2^{(n - 1)}\), which is unrelated to the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The annotations support that the program's logic does not align with the required computation.

Therefore, I affirm the original assessment's correctness. 

Final: **False**
