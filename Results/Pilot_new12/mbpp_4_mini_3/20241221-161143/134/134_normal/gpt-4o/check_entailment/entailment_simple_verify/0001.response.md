The original assessment clearly describes the requirements of the problem: to compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). It also correctly analyzes the provided function `func_1` and finds that the outputs do not match the expected sums of even index binomial coefficients. 

The annotated version verifies that `func_1` indeed returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \) for a valid positive integer input. However, as the original assessment demonstrated, the expected sums for the test cases do not align with this output:

1. For \( n = 4 \), \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7 \), while \( func_1(4) = 8 \).
2. For \( n = 6 \), \( C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) = 31 \), while \( func_1(6) = 32 \).
3. For \( n = 2 \), \( C(2, 0) = 1 \), while \( func_1(2) = 2 \).

These discrepancies confirm that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, upon reassessing the program's behavior in light of the problem statement and the annotations, the original assessment remains valid. The function does not correctly compute the required sums for the specified inputs.

Final: **False**
