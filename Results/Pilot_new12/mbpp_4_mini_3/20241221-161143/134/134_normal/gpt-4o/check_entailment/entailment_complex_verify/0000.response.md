Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not implement the functionality required by the problem description, which is to compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The code instead returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is unrelated to the sum of even indexed binomial coefficients. 

As noted in the annotated version, the function simply calculates an exponentiation without performing the necessary calculations for the binomial coefficients. Hence, while it may coincidentally yield correct results for specific inputs (like `n = 4`), it does not follow the correct logic as described in the problem statement, confirming that the program is incorrect.
