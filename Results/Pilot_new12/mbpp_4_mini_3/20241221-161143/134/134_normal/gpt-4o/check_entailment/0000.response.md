Correctness: **False**.

The problem description asks for a function that finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. However, the provided program does not implement this logic. It simply returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not relate to the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

For example, let's consider `n = 4`. The binomial coefficients for `n = 4` are `1, 4, 6, 4, 1`. The even indexed coefficients are `1` (index 0), `6` (index 2), and `1` (index 4), which sum to `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`. The program correctly returns `8` for this input, but this is sheer coincidence since it does not perform the necessary calculations.

Testing with another value, `n = 6`, the expected even index binomial coefficients would be `1 (index 0), 15 (index 2), and 20 (index 4), and summing these would yield `1 + 15 + 20 = 36`. However, the program indiscriminately returns `32` instead of calculating the actual binomial coefficients.

Thus, the program is not implementing the functionality asked for in the problem description.
