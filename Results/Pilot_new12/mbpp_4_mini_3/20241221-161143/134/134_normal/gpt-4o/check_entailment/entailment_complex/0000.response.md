Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description requirements. The problem requires a function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer `n`. However, the function `func_1` simply computes `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not correspond to the appropriate sum of even index binomial coefficients.

To clarify, the binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \) represents the coefficients in the binomial expansion. Specifically, the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for a given `n` can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Sum} = C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + C(n, 4) + \ldots
\]

The result of the function does not involve calculating any binomial coefficients and instead produces an output that does not relate to the specified task. For example:
- For `n = 4`, the even-index coefficients are \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7 \), while the program outputs `2 ** (4 - 1) = 8`.
- For `n = 6`, the even-index coefficients are \( C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) = 1 + 15 + 15 = 31 \), while the program outputs `2 ** (6 - 1) = 32`.

Since the program does not perform the calculations required by the problem description and does not yield correct results for the provided assertions, it is deemed incorrect.
