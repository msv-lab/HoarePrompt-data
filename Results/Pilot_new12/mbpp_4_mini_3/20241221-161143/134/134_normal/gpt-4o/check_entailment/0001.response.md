To determine the correctness of the provided program, we first need to understand what the problem description asks for: the function should take a positive integer \( n \) and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

The binomial coefficients for \( n \) can be represented as \( C(n, k) \) where \( k \) ranges from 0 to \( n \). The even index binomial coefficients are those where \( k \) is even, specifically \( C(n, 0), C(n, 2), C(n, 4), \ldots \).

Now let's analyze the provided function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

This function returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \). Looking at the assertions provided:

```python
assert func_1(4) == 8   # Corresponds to C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7
assert func_1(6) == 32  # Corresponds to C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) = 1 + 15 + 15 = 31
assert func_1(2) == 2   # Corresponds to C(2, 0) = 1
```

Next, we should evaluate the correctness of these assertions:

1. For \( n = 4 \):
   - Even index coefficients are \( C(4, 0) = 1 \) and \( C(4, 2) = 6 \).
   - Their sum is \( 1 + 6 = 7 \), but `func_1(4)` returns \( 2^3 = 8 \), which is incorrect.

2. For \( n = 6 \):
   - Even index coefficients are \( C(6, 0) = 1 \), \( C(6, 2) = 15 \), and \( C(6, 4) = 15 \).
   - Their sum is \( 1 + 15 + 15 = 31 \), but `func_1(6)` returns \( 2^5 = 32 \), which is incorrect.

3. For \( n = 2 \):
   - The only even index coefficient is \( C(2, 0) = 1 \).
   - `func_1(2)` returns \( 2^1 = 2 \), which is incorrect since the expected sum is \( 1 \).

Since the function fails to correctly compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients for all cases provided in the assertions, we conclude that the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
