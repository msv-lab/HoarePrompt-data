Correctness: **False**

The provided program claims to compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients, but the implementation instead returns \(2^{(n-1)}\). This does not align with the task of summing even index binomial coefficients. For example, if \(n = 4\), the binomial coefficients for 4 are: 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. The sum of the even index coefficients (1 + 6 + 1) should be 8, which coincidentally matches the output for \(n = 4\) but is not derived from the logic of the code.

However, the function's formula does not accurately compute the desired outcome for cases like \(n = 6\). The binomial coefficients for \(n = 6\) include 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, and the sum of the even indices (1 + 15 + 15 + 1 = 32) matches the output for \(n = 6\) but with no logical grounding in the code.

Moreover, the output is based on a mathematical pattern rather than the function implementing the task of summing even index binomial coefficients specifically. Therefore, the code does not address the actual problem described and can yield incorrect or unintended results for other inputs.

The claim of computing the sum of even index binomial coefficients is not met by the provided implementation. The output hints do not provide sufficient guarantee that this method will correctly cover all potential cases outlined in the problem description.
