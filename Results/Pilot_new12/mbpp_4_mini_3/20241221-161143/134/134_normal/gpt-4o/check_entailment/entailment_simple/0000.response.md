The provided program is meant to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer \( n \). 

However, the implementation of the function `func_1` simply returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \). This result does not correspond to the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for the given \( n \).

### Analysis:

1. **Binomial Coefficients**: The even index binomial coefficients for \( n \) correspond to the values from the binomial expansion \( (1 + 1)^n \). The even index coefficients are given by \( C(n, 0), C(n, 2), C(n, 4), \ldots \), where \( C(n, k) \) represents the binomial coefficient "n choose k".
  
2. **Formula for Sum of Even Index Binomial Coefficients**: The sum of the coefficients at even indices can be derived using the property that:
   \[
   \text{sum of even index coefficients} = \frac{(1 + 1)^n + (1 - 1)^n}{2} = \frac{2^n + 0}{2} = 2^{n-1}
   \]
   However, this is only appropriate when deriving the overall sum from both even and odd indexed coefficients. By considering only the even indexed coefficients directly, the output will not necessarily yield \( 2^{(n-1)} \).

3. **Assertions**: The assertion statements show expected results:
   - \( \text{func\_1}(4) == 8 \)
   - \( \text{func\_1}(6) == 32 \)
   - \( \text{func\_1}(2) == 2 \)

   These are correct for \( 2^{(n-1)} \) but do not validate correctness with regards to the actual binomial coefficients required by the problem description.
   
4. **Conclusion**: The function does not calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients; it calculates \( 2^{(n-1)} \) instead, which is misleading in the context of the problem.

Based on the above analysis, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
