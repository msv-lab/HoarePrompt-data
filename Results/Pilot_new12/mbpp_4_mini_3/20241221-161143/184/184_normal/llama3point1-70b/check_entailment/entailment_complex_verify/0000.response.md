The original assessment was that the program is incorrect because it filters for odd numbers with the expression `num % 2 != 0`, which would return odd numbers instead of filtering them out as required by the problem description. The goal was to filter out odd numbers and presumably keep even ones, making it necessary for the function to return even numbers from a list like `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, leading to an expected output of `[2, 4]`.

The annotated code supports this assessment by confirming that the program indeed returns a list of odd integers from `nums`. It states that the function will only give odd integers, indicating that it does not meet the problem description which specifies filtering out odd numbers.

Given the above reasoning and supporting evidence from the annotations, it is clear that the original assessment holds true. 

Final: **False**
