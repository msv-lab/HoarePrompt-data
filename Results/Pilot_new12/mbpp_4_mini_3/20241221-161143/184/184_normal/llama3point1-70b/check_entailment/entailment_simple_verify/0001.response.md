The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the program. The problem description clearly states the requirement to filter out odd numbers, which implies returning even numbers only. However, the implementation returns a list of odd numbers from the input list, as evidenced by the annotation indicating that the program returns a list of odd integers. 

In terms of the annotated version, it confirms that the function `func_1` filters for odd numbers and returns them, which does not fulfill the requirement set out in the problem description to filter odd numbers, indicating that the function should instead return even numbers.

Therefore, based on the information provided:

Final: **False**
