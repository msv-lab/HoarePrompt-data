Correctness: **False**

The provided program filters out odd numbers from a list. However, the implementation actually returns odd numbers instead of filtering them out. According to the problem description, the function must filter odd numbers, which implies it should return only the even numbers.

For example:
- If the input is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the expected output should be `[2, 4]` (even numbers), but the program will return `[1, 3]` (odd numbers). 

This clearly shows that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
