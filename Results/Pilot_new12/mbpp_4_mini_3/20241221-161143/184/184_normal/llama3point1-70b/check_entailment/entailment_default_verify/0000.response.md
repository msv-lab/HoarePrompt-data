Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the problem description specifically states to filter odd numbers. However, the program is designed to return odd numbers based on the condition `num % 2 != 0`, which contradicts the requirement of filtering them out. The output hints confirm that the program's intended functionality is to return odd integers from the input list, instead of filtering them out. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, resulting in an assessment of **False** for correctness.
