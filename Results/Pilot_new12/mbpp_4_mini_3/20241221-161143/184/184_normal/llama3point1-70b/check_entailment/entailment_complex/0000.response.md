The annotated program correctly implements the function as described in the problem description.

The problem description states that the function must filter odd numbers from a list of integers. The provided function `func_1(nums)` does the following:

1. It accepts a parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in `nums` and constructs a new list that includes only the numbers which are odd (i.e., numbers for which `num % 2 != 0` is true).
3. If `nums` is empty, the list comprehension will return an empty list, which meets the requirement.

The annotations clarify that:
- The function will handle any integer values correctly by filtering out the odd numbers.
- Non-integer types in the list will be ignored, meaning the function wonâ€™t raise an error for input types but will simply not include those in the result.

Overall, it meets all the criteria outlined in the problem description. The focus on extracting only odd numbers is consistent with the expected output.

Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
