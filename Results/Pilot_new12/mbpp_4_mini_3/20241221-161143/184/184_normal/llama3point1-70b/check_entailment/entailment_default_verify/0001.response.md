Based on the analysis of the problem description, the provided program, and the original assessment:

1. The problem description clearly states that the function is to filter odd numbers. This implies that the output should consist of even numbers only, as filtering odd numbers means removing them.

2. The program's logic, as shown in the code, is designed to return a list of odd numbers: `return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]`. This contradicts the explicit requirement set forth in the problem description.

3. The original assessment, which claims the program's correctness is **False**, is justified and accurate. It correctly interprets that the function, while syntactically valid, does not meet the needs of the problem description. It provides clear reasoning, including an example illustrating that the function returns a list of odd numbers rather than filtering them out.

4. The output hints confirm that the function indeed returns odd numbers and lack any handling for non-integer types but does not influence the core correctness in meeting the problem's requirement to filter odd numbers.

Taking all of this into account, the original assessment is valid. Therefore, the final correctness of the program can be concluded as:

Final: **False**
