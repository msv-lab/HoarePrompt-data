The given program is intended to filter out odd numbers from a list of integers. The code correctly uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list `nums`. 

The output hints explain that the function will return an empty list if `nums` is empty and that it does not raise errors for non-integer types present in the input list. Instead, non-integer types are effectively ignored.

In terms of correctness:
- The program meets the requirement of filtering odd numbers as specified in the problem description.
- It correctly handles the case where `nums` is empty by returning an empty list.
- The handling of non-integer types by ignoring them without raising errors is consistent with the hints and is also permissible under the assumption of valid input.

There are no identified edge cases or examples provided that would cause the program to fail while adhering to the specifications given in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
