Correctness: **False**.

The program's objective is to filter odd numbers, but the condition `num % 2 != 0` is incorrect as it would return odd numbers. The problem description requires the function to filter out odd numbers and presumably keep even numbers. Thus, for an input like `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, the expected output should be `[2, 4]`, but the program will output `[1, 3]`, showing it does not meet the requirement.
