Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to filter out odd numbers from a list of integers, as per the problem description. However, the implementation is returning a list of odd integers instead of filtering them out. The line `num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0` does not filter out the odd numbers; instead, it creates a new list comprised entirely of odd integers. 

To be correct according to the problem description, the program should return a list of even numbers instead of odd numbers. Since it does not meet the requirement of filtering out odd numbers, it is not correct.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description.
