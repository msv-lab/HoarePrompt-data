Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to filter a list of integers to return only the odd numbers. While the code correctly identifies odd integers and returns them, it does not handle non-integer types appropriately. According to the output hints, if `nums` contains non-integer types (like strings or floats), those will be silently ignored without raising an error. This implies that the function is not robust against certain edge cases (specifically when encountering non-integer types), which contradicts the expectation set by the problem description on handling potential input variations.

For example, if the input `nums` were `[1, 2, 'three', 4.5, 5]`, the function would return `[1, 5]`, completely disregarding the presence of non-integer types. The requirement was to filter odd numbers, and therefore the potential lack of error handling implies that the function could lead to unexpected behavior or confusion when non-integer values are present.

Thus, since the function does not process all potential inputs as specified by the problem description, it is deemed incorrect.
