#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd integers from the list 'nums'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a new list containing only the odd integers extracted from `nums`. If `nums` is empty, the function will return an empty list. Additionally, the function does not handle any non-integer types that may be present in `nums`, meaning if the input list contains elements that are not integers, they will be ignored without raising an error. The final state of the program is a list of odd integers, or an empty list if there are no odd integers or if `nums` is empty.
