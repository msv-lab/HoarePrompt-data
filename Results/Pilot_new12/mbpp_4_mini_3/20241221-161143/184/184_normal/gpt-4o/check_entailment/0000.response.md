Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the provided list of integers. It does this by using a list comprehension that iterates through each number in the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers for which `num % 2 != 0` evaluates to `True` (i.e., the number is odd). 

The provided assertions are all valid and return the expected results:
- The first assertion filters odd numbers from `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` correctly yields `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
- The second assertion from `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]` correctly returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
- The third assertion filters `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]` producing `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

There are no missing edge cases in the logic as all potential edge cases (such as empty lists or lists with no odd numbers) would naturally be handled by the list comprehension, resulting in an empty list when appropriate. Thus, the program meets the specification accurately.
