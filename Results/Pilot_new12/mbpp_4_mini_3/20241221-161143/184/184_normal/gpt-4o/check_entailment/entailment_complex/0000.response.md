Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to filter and return only the odd numbers from a list of integers. 

Here's how the program aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers.

2. **Output**: The function returns a new list. This list contains all the odd integers from the input list `nums`. If all integers in `nums` are even or if it contains no integers, the return value will be an empty list as indicated in the problem requirement.

3. **Implementation**: The filtering is done using a list comprehension that checks each integer `num` in `nums` with the condition `num % 2 != 0`, which effectively selects odd numbers.

4. **Examples**: The assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate that the function correctly filters odd numbers for various input lists.

- For a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which consists solely of odd integers.
- For a list `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, the output is `[45, 67, 93]`, correctly capturing the odd integers.
- For the list `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, the output `[5, 7, 9, 3]` reflects the odd integers present.

Since the function meets the expected behavior as described in the problem statement and outputs the correct filtered results, we conclude the program is correct. The parts of the implementation that do not handle invalid inputs do not affect its correctness under the assumption that valid input is always provided.
