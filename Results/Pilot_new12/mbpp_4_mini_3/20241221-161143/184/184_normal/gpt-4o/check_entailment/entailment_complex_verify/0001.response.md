Final: **True**

The original assessment concludes that the function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list, which aligns with the problem description stating that the goal is to write a function to filter odd numbers. 

Upon analyzing the provided annotations:
1. The function directly operates on a list of integers, returning a new list containing only those numbers that are odd, as confirmed by the logic encapsulated in the list comprehension `num % 2 != 0`.
2. The assertions provided in the original assessment all yield correct results, representing scenarios that demonstrate the function's logic effectively.
3. The annotated version further elaborates that the function will return an empty list when no odd integers are present, reinforcing its correct behavior regarding filtering.

The point about not handling inputs that are not lists or can contain non-integer types is valid; however, as stated, we are to operate under the assumption that inputs will always be valid lists of integers. Thus, this aspect does not undermine the correctness of the function within the specified constraints.

Overall, every aspect examined—especially the validations and expected outputs—supports that the initial assessment that the program is correct is indeed accurate. Therefore, I maintain that the function meets the problem requirements satisfactorily.
