Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` filters odd numbers from a list of integers, returning a new list that contains only those odd numbers. Let's analyze the provided assertions and potential edge cases:

1. The function uses list comprehension to iterate through each number `num` in the input list `nums` and checks if it is odd using `num % 2 != 0`. This logic is correct for identifying odd numbers.

2. The assertions provided:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` correctly outputs `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are the odd numbers in the input list.
   - `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` correctly outputs `[45, 67, 93]`, which are the odd numbers in the input list.
   - `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` correctly outputs `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, which are the odd numbers in the input list.

3. Additionally, checking edge cases:
   - An empty list `func_1([])` should return `[]`, which is correct.
   - An input list with all even numbers like `func_1([2, 4, 6])` should return `[]`, which is correct.
   - An input list with all odd numbers like `func_1([1, 3, 5])` should return `[1, 3, 5]`, which is also correct.

Since the function works correctly for a variety of valid scenarios and edge cases without failure, I conclude that it meets the problem description requirements with no missing logic or edge cases unhandled. 

Thus, the final determination is that the program is correct.
