Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the specified functionality of filtering odd numbers from a list of integers. 

Here's the explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`nums`) and returns a new list containing only the odd integers. This directly aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to filter odd numbers.

2. **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension that iterates through each integer in the input list and checks if it is odd using the condition `num % 2 != 0`. If the condition is true, the number is included in the resulting list.

3. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases to verify the correctness of the function:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` correctly returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
   - `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` correctly returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
   - `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` correctly returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

All tests confirm that the function accurately filters out the odd numbers as described in the problem.

Given these points, the program fully meets the requirements of the problem description.
