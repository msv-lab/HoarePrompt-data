The function `func_1` correctly filters odd numbers from the provided list of integers as described in the problem statement. It utilizes a list comprehension to create a new list of numbers that are odd (`num % 2 != 0`), which is exactly what is required.

The output hints also align well with the functionality of the code, stating that it returns a new list that contains only odd integers. Moreover, since the given examples in the assertions provide a sufficient basis for testing valid inputs, all indicated cases would return the expected outputs.

Although the hints indeed mention that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or contains non-integer elements, the problem statement assures that the input will always be valid. Therefore, under the assumption that proper input is provided, the function will work as intended.

Consequently, since the function fulfills the requirements and no cases arise from the given problem description that would make it incorrect if valid input is assumed, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
