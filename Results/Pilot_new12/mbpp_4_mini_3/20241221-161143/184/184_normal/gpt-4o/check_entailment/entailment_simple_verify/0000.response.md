Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` effectively filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers, as evidenced by the provided assertions and the annotations.

The annotations confirm that before the function is called, `nums` is indeed a list of integers, which aligns with the assumptions and the problem description. Additionally, the statements following the function definition clearly indicate that it returns a list comprising all odd integers from the input list, validating its intended functionality.

All assertions validate that the function works as expected:
- The first assertion correctly filters odd numbers from the range 1 to 10.
- The second assertion accurately captures the odd numbers from the mix of values in the list.
- The third assertion confirms that the function identifies the odd numbers among a more varied list of integers.

Thus, the implementation is correct, meets the problem description, and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
