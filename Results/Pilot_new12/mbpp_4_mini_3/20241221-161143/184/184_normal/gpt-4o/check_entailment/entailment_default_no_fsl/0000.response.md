Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not conform to the problem description for every potential case. Although the function `func_1` correctly filters odd numbers from a list of integers, it does not handle the case where the input could be invalid, such as when the input is not a list or contains non-integer elements. 

For example:
1. If the input is `func_1("1, 2, 3")`, the function will raise a runtime error.
2. If the input is `func_1([1, 2, 'three'])`, the function will also raise a runtime error because of the string 'three'.

Since these cases could potentially occur and are not managed by the code, the output does not satisfy the problem description in all scenarios. Thus, the correctness is marked as false.
