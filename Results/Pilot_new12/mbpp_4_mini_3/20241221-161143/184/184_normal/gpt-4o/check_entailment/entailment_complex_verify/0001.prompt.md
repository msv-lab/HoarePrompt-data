You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]) == [45, 67, 93]
assert func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]) == [5, 7, 9, 3]

def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` filters odd numbers from a list of integers, returning a new list that contains only those odd numbers. Let's analyze the provided assertions and potential edge cases:

1. The function uses list comprehension to iterate through each number `num` in the input list `nums` and checks if it is odd using `num % 2 != 0`. This logic is correct for identifying odd numbers.

2. The assertions provided:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` correctly outputs `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are the odd numbers in the input list.
   - `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` correctly outputs `[45, 67, 93]`, which are the odd numbers in the input list.
   - `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` correctly outputs `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, which are the odd numbers in the input list.

3. Additionally, checking edge cases:
   - An empty list `func_1([])` should return `[]`, which is correct.
   - An input list with all even numbers like `func_1([2, 4, 6])` should return `[]`, which is correct.
   - An input list with all odd numbers like `func_1([1, 3, 5])` should return `[1, 3, 5]`, which is also correct.

Since the function works correctly for a variety of valid scenarios and edge cases without failure, I conclude that it meets the problem description requirements with no missing logic or edge cases unhandled. 

Thus, the final determination is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]) == [45, 67, 93]
assert func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]) == [5, 7, 9, 3]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of all odd integers from the list 'nums'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a new list that contains only the odd integers from the input list. If the input list contains no odd integers, the function will return an empty list. Additionally, it does not handle any cases where the input is not a list or contains non-integer elements, as such scenarios will lead to a runtime error. Overall, the final state of the program is that it produces a list of odd integers filtered from the provided list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
