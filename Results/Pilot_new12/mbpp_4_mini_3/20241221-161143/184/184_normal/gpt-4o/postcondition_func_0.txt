The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a new list that contains only the odd integers from the input list. If the input list contains no odd integers, the function will return an empty list. Additionally, it does not handle any cases where the input is not a list or contains non-integer elements, as such scenarios will lead to a runtime error. Overall, the final state of the program is that it produces a list of odd integers filtered from the provided list.
