Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. While it correctly handles tuples and returns True for an empty tuple, it does not account for the case where the input is not a tuple. If a user passes a non-tuple input (like a list, a string, or an integer), the program would raise an error. 

For instance, calling `func_1([1, 2, 3])` would result in a TypeError because the code expects `tup` to be a tuple. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement of checking "if all the elements in tuple have the same data type" accurately for every potential case, specifically when the input is not a tuple. Thus, the program is incorrect.
