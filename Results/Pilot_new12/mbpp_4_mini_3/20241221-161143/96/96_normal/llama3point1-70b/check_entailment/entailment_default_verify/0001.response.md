Final: **False**

While the function `func_1` correctly checks for uniform data types within a tuple and appropriately handles the case of an empty tuple returning `True`, the output hints indicate that the program does not specifically handle scenarios where the input is not a tuple. This could lead to errors if, for instance, a list, string, or other non-tuple data type is passed to the function. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness as **True** is inaccurate, as it does not address this potential failure point.
