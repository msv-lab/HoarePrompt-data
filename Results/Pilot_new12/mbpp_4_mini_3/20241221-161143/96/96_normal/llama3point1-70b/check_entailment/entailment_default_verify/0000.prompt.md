You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type by creating a set of the types of the elements and then checking if the length of that set is equal to 1. This correctly identifies if all elements are of the same type or not. 

Testing it with various tuple inputs demonstrates that the function works for all scenarios:
- For a tuple containing only integers, such as `(1, 2, 3)`, the function would return `True`, which is correct.
- For a tuple with mixed types, like `(1, 'a', 3.0)`, the function would return `False`, which is also correct.
- Even special cases like an empty tuple `()` or a single element tuple `(1,)` would correctly return `True`, since there are no differing types.

Since it correctly handles all potential cases, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple 'tup' that can contain elements of any data type. It evaluates whether all elements in the tuple are of the same data type by converting the elements to their types and using a set to check for uniqueness. The function returns True if all elements share the same data type, and False if they do not. It correctly accounts for edge cases such as an empty tuple, which will return True since there are no differing types. However, it does not handle the case where 'tup' is not a tuple; in such cases, it could raise an error. The program effectively serves to confirm the uniformity of types within a tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
