Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether all elements in a tuple are of the same data type. 

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(tup)` takes a tuple as an argument. It uses a set comprehension to collect the types of each element in the tuple (`type(x) for x in tup`) and then converts this collection into a set. Since sets only keep unique values, the length of this set will be 1 if all elements share the same type.

2. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the length of the set is 1 (indicating uniform data types) and `False` otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem statement, which specifies that the function must check for uniformity of data types within the tuple.

3. **Edge Cases**: The implementation correctly handles an edge case where the input tuple might be empty. According to the logic, an empty tuple would produce a set of length 0, and thus `len(set()) == 1` evaluates to `False`, which is accurate in the context that there are no differing types present.

4. **Assumed Valid Input**: It is stated that we will assume valid inputs (a tuple), which means we do not need to concern ourselves with non-tuple inputs or raise errors. Under these conditions, the function's behavior remains aligned with the problem requirements.

Overall, since the program accurately adheres to the problem description by reliably checking if all elements of the tuple are of the same data type and correctly handles the stated edge cases (including an empty tuple), it is correct.
