Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type by creating a set of the types of the elements and then checking if the length of that set is equal to 1. This correctly identifies if all elements are of the same type or not. 

Testing it with various tuple inputs demonstrates that the function works for all scenarios:
- For a tuple containing only integers, such as `(1, 2, 3)`, the function would return `True`, which is correct.
- For a tuple with mixed types, like `(1, 'a', 3.0)`, the function would return `False`, which is also correct.
- Even special cases like an empty tuple `()` or a single element tuple `(1,)` would correctly return `True`, since there are no differing types.

Since it correctly handles all potential cases, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
