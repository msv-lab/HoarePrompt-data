According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` contains at least 2 elements. To execute one more time, the tuple must contain at least 3 elements and the `element` will be the third element in the tuple.

State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 3 elements, element is the third element, first_type remains the same.**
