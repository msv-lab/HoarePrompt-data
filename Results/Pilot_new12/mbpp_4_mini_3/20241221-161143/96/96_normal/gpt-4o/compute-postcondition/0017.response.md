Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `tup`, which is a tuple that can contain elements of any data type. It returns True if the tuple is empty. If the tuple is not empty, it checks whether all elements in the tuple are of the same data type as the first element. If any element differs in type from the first, it returns False. If all elements are of the same type, it returns True. The function has the potential edge case of raising an `IndexError` if the tuple is not empty but contains no elements (an empty tuple), which is technically not possible as it would exit at the initial condition that checks for emptiness. However, the annotations erroneously suggest a consistent return of True for non-empty tuples, which is misleading as False may be returned if types differ. Additionally, there are no safeguards against heterogeneous tuples when they contain elements that are not compatible with an expected common type based on the first element.**
