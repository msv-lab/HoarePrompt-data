#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing elements that can be of any data type.
def func_1(tup):
    if (not tup) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, as the return statement does not depend on the state of 'tup', which is currently an empty tuple.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`tup` is a tuple containing elements that can be of any data type, and `tup` is not empty.
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a tuple containing elements of the same type as `first_type`; `first_type` is the type of the elements in `tup`; `element` is any element from `tup`, and all elements share the same type as `first_type`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating a successful execution regardless of the contents of the tuple 'tup' which contains elements of the same type as 'first_type'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `tup`, which is a tuple that can contain elements of any data type. It returns True if the tuple is empty. If the tuple is not empty, it checks whether all elements in the tuple are of the same data type as the first element. If any element differs in type from the first, it returns False. If all elements are of the same type, it returns True. The function has the potential edge case of raising an `IndexError` if the tuple is not empty but contains no elements (an empty tuple), which is technically not possible as it would exit at the initial condition that checks for emptiness. However, the annotations erroneously suggest a consistent return of True for non-empty tuples, which is misleading as False may be returned if types differ. Additionally, there are no safeguards against heterogeneous tuples when they contain elements that are not compatible with an expected common type based on the first element.
