Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given function `func_1` is supposed to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. While the logic appears to work for the provided assertions, the code does not completely fulfill the problem description for all potential cases. 

Specifically, the function will return `True` for an empty tuple, which is acceptable based on its logic. However, it won't handle scenarios where the tuple contains valid elements of different types correctly, based on how it checks types against the first element. For example, consider the tuple `(1, 2.0, '3')`. The output will be `False`, which is correct, but it fails to give a clear output for cases where heterogeneous but implicitly convertible types (like integers and floats) could be considered the same by some users, potentially leading to confusion. The hints also mislead by suggesting the function's behavior is consistent, which it is not depending on type checks.

Therefore, while the function works as intended according to provided examples, it shows inconsistencies with what could be interpreted from different mixed-type tuples, and thus cannot be considered fully correct.
