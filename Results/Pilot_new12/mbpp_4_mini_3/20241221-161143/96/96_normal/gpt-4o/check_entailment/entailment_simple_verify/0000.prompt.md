You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

def func_1(tup):
    if not tup:
        return True
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all the elements in the tuple have the same data type. It first checks if the tuple is empty, in which case it returns `True`, as there are no elements that can have differing types. Then it stores the type of the first element and iterates through the tuple, comparing the type of each element to the type of the first. If it finds a different type, it returns `False`. If it successfully checks all elements without finding any type discrepancies, it returns `True`. The provided assertions cover various cases including tuples with all identical types, tuples with mixed types, and a tuple with numeric types only, demonstrating that the implementation behaves as expected in all tested scenarios.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing elements that can be of any data type.
def func_1(tup):
    if (not tup) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, as the return statement does not depend on the state of 'tup', which is currently an empty tuple.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`tup` is a tuple containing elements that can be of any data type, and `tup` is not empty.
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a tuple containing elements of the same type as `first_type`; `first_type` is the type of the elements in `tup`; `element` is any element from `tup`, and all elements share the same type as `first_type`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating a successful execution regardless of the contents of the tuple 'tup' which contains elements of the same type as 'first_type'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
