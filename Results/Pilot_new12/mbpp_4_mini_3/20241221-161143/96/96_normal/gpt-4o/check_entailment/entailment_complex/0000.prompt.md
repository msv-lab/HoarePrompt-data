You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing elements that can be of any data type.
def func_1(tup):
    if (not tup) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, as the return statement does not depend on the state of 'tup', which is currently an empty tuple.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`tup` is a tuple containing elements that can be of any data type, and `tup` is not empty.
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a tuple containing elements of the same type as `first_type`; `first_type` is the type of the elements in `tup`; `element` is any element from `tup`, and all elements share the same type as `first_type`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating a successful execution regardless of the contents of the tuple 'tup' which contains elements of the same type as 'first_type'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `tup`, which is a tuple that can contain elements of any data type. It returns True if the tuple is empty. If the tuple is not empty, it checks whether all elements in the tuple are of the same data type as the first element. If any element differs in type from the first, it returns False. If all elements are of the same type, it returns True. The function has the potential edge case of raising an `IndexError` if the tuple is not empty but contains no elements (an empty tuple), which is technically not possible as it would exit at the initial condition that checks for emptiness. However, the annotations erroneously suggest a consistent return of True for non-empty tuples, which is misleading as False may be returned if types differ. Additionally, there are no safeguards against heterogeneous tuples when they contain elements that are not compatible with an expected common type based on the first element.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
