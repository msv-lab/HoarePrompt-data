The original assessment concluded that the function `func_1` is correct based on its implementation and tested assertion cases. Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code along with the reasoning behind its correctness, I observe potential inconsistencies that raise questions regarding the overall assurance of reliability in the function.

1. **Initial Condition Handling**: The function correctly returns `True` for an empty tuple, aligning with the problem description that states that a non-empty tuple is not required for type verification.

2. **Type Checking**: The function works under the assumption that if the tuple is non-empty, it will compare each type of element against the type of the first element. The logic for checking the types is sound. However, the annotated comments misleadingly imply a guarantee of consistent true returns for non-empty tuples, without highlighting that it will return `False` if any types differ.

3. **Edge Cases**: The annotations point out that if a tuple contained mixed types – such as an integer and a string – the function will correctly identify these differences. However, the language of the annotations seems to downplay the importance of this behavior.

4. **Assessment of Assertions**: The provided assertions sufficiently cover possible scenarios: all similar types, mixed types, and neither case. The statements successfully reflect the intended functionality.

Taking all of these points into account, while the function does indeed function correctly and aligns with its intended purpose, the annotated code does have some misleading interpretations of its behavior, especially surrounding its behavior in non-trivial cases. However, since we are also assuming valid inputs as per the instructions, the critical evaluation still shows the function adequately meets the problem requirements.

Given the structured evaluation of the provided information, I conclude that the original assessment of the function as correct still holds.

Final: **True**
