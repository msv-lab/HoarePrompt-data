Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if all the elements in the tuple have the same data type. It first checks if the tuple is empty, in which case it returns `True`, as there are no elements that can have differing types. Then it stores the type of the first element and iterates through the tuple, comparing the type of each element to the type of the first. If it finds a different type, it returns `False`. If it successfully checks all elements without finding any type discrepancies, it returns `True`. The provided assertions cover various cases including tuples with all identical types, tuples with mixed types, and a tuple with numeric types only, demonstrating that the implementation behaves as expected in all tested scenarios.
