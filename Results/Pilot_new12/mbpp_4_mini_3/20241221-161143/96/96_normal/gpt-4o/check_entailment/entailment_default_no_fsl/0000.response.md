Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the case where the tuple contains only one element. In this case, the function would still return `True`, which is correct, but the example assertions do not cover this edge case. Additionally, there's a lack of clarity in the output hints regarding the expected behavior when dealing with tuples containing some invalid types or combinations of types that might not align with expectations.

For example, a tuple containing a single element `func_1((5,))` would return `True`, which is correct, but without explicit assertion in the provided examples, it's unclear whether this has been accounted correctly by the testing. Furthermore, the output hints suggest potential inconsistencies in the understanding of scenarios where the tuple might contain mixed types that are not covered.

Overall, since we cannot verify correctness for every potential case effectively with the information provided, this leads to a determination that the overall correctness of the function is false.
