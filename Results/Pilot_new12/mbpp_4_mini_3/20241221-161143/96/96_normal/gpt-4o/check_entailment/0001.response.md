Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly verifies if all elements in the provided tuple have the same data type. Here's the reasoning behind this conclusion:

1. **Empty Tuple**: The function returns `True` if the tuple is empty, which is a sensible definition since there are no elements to contradict uniformity in data types.

2. **Type Checking**: The function captures the type of the first element and iterates over the rest of the elements to check if their data types match. If any element has a different type than the first one, it returns `False`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - For the input `(5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)`, all elements are integers, so the output is `True`.
   - For the input `(1, 2, '4')`, the first two elements are integers while the last one is a string, leading to a correct output of `False`.
   - For the input `(3, 2, 1, 4, 5)`, all elements are integers, resulting in a correct output of `True`.

I could not find any case where the function does not meet the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct for all tested cases and adheres to the requirements given in the problem statement.
