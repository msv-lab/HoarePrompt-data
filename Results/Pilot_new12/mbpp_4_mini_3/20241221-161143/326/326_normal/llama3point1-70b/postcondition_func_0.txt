The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It sorts the list `arr` and calculates the minimum absolute difference between any two successive integers in the sorted list. It returns this minimum difference. However, the function does not utilize the `target` parameter in any way, which implies it might be irrelevant to the output. If `arr` has fewer than two elements, the function does not handle this edge case and could lead to incomplete functionality as differences cannot be computed with less than two elements.
