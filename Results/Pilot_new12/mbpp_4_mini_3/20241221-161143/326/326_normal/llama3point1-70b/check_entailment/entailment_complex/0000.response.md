Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the program only computes the minimum absolute difference between successive elements in a sorted version of the array. 

This represents a specific case where the minimum difference is found only between adjacent elements in the sorted list, rather than considering all possible pairs of elements in the given array. As a result, it may miss the minimum difference if the two elements with the smallest difference are not adjacent when sorted. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the edge case where the input array has fewer than two elements, which is critical because the concept of finding a difference requires at least two elements.

Therefore, while the program does sort the array and calculate a difference, it does not adhere to the broader requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements. Consequently, the assertion that the function meets the problem description is incorrect.
