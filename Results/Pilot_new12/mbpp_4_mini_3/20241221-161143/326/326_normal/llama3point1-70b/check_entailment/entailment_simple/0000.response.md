Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it only computes the minimum difference between successive elements in the sorted array, rather than finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the specified array. 

For example, consider the array `[1, 5, 3]`. The correct minimum difference between any two elements is `1` (between `3` and `5`), but the program only considers the differences between the sorted pairs (`1 and 3`, `3 and 5`), which would yield a minimum difference of `2`. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect as it fails to consider all pairs of elements in the array, which is required to accurately find the minimum difference between any two elements.
