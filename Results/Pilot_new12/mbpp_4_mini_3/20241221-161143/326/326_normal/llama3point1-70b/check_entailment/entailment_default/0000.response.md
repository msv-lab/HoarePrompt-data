The provided program attempts to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. It sorts the array and then calculates the absolute differences between successive elements to determine the minimum difference. 

However, there are two major issues that violate the correctness requirements:

1. The function does not handle the case where the length of the input array `arr` is less than 2. If `arr` has fewer than two elements (like an empty array or an array with a single element), the code will still run but will not correctly compute a minimum difference since there are not enough elements to compare.

2. The `target` parameter is not utilized in any way, which renders it irrelevant based on the output hints provided. While this isn't strictly against the problem description, it suggests that the implementation is not completely aligned with the expected functionality since it adds confusion about its purpose.

Given these points, the function fails to work as intended for all potential cases. The failure to address an edge case (arrays with fewer than two elements) confirms that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
