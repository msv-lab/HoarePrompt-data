To analyze the given program, let's break down the problem description and the code implementation.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

### Review of the Program:
1. The program sorts the input array which will help in comparing adjacent elements for minimum differences.
2. It initializes `min_diff` to infinity to ensure that any calculated difference will be smaller when first assessed.
3. The code correctly iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute differences between consecutive elements and updating the `min_diff` variable if a smaller difference is found.

### Potential Cases to Check:
1. **Array with two identical elements (e.g., `[5, 5]`):**
    - Expected output: The minimum difference would be `0` since both elements are the same.
    - Actual program behavior: The program calculates the difference of `abs(5 - 5)` which will yield `0`. This case works correctly.

2. **Array with multiple elements having equal values (e.g., `[1, 2, 1, 2]`):**
    - The minimum difference should still be `0` since two `1`s and two `2`s exist.
    - The program will correctly identify the minimum difference as `0`.

3. **Array with only one element (e.g., `[7]`):**
    - Expected output: Since there is only one element, the program does not have two distinct values to compare and there should be a consideration for this edge case.
    - Actual program behavior: The function crashes because it attempts to access `arr[i + 1]` when `i` is the last valid index, which does not exist for a single-element array.

### Conclusion on Correctness:
The program does not handle the edge case of an array having only one element or being empty, which results in trying to access an index that does not exist. Therefore, we can conclude that this program is not correct since there are scenarios where it fails to operate according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
