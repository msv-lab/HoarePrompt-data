Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, if the input array `arr` has fewer than two elements (for example, if it's empty or contains only one element), the function will not be able to compute a minimum difference, leading to potential incomplete functionality. 

Additionally, the `target` parameter is accepted but not utilized at all in the function, which raises questions about the purpose of the parameter in the context of the problem statement. Since the function fails to handle the case of insufficient elements in the input array and does not utilize the `target` parameter, it does not meet the requirements for correctness in every potential case.
