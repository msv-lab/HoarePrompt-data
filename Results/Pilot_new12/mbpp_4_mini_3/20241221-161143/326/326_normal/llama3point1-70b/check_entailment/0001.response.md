Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input array has less than two elements. If the array has one element or is empty, the function will proceed to the loop where it tries to access elements in the array that do not exist, which would lead to an out-of-bounds error. 

For example:
- If the input is `[]`, it returns an error rather than a minimum difference.
- If the input is `[5]`, it also returns an error.

According to the problem description, the function should be able to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, which implies it should also handle edge cases appropriately. Since the code does not check for these conditions, it is incorrect.
