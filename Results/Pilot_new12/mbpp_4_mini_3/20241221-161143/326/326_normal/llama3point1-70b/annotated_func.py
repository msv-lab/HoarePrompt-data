#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum absolute difference between any two successive integers in `arr`, and `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum absolute difference between any two successive integers in the sorted list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It sorts the list `arr` and calculates the minimum absolute difference between any two successive integers in the sorted list. It returns this minimum difference. However, the function does not utilize the `target` parameter in any way, which implies it might be irrelevant to the output. If `arr` has fewer than two elements, the function does not handle this edge case and could lead to incomplete functionality as differences cannot be computed with less than two elements.
