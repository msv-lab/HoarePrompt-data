The variable `arr` is assigned the value of its sorted version. This means that `arr` will now be a list of integers sorted in ascending order. The variable `target` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `target` is an integer.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers; `target` is an integer**.
