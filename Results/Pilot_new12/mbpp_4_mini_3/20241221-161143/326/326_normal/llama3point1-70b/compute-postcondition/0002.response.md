According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `arr` list. The loop will run from `0` to `len(arr) - 2`, so for the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must contain at least 2 elements. The initial value of `i` will start at `0`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `arr` has at least 2 elements. Since `min_diff` is mentioned but does not impact the execution of this loop directly, it can remain unchanged.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
