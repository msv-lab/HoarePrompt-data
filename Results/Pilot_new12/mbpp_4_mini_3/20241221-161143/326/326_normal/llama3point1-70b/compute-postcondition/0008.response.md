`diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i+1]`. With `i` being 1, this means `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. Consequently, the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])**
