In the provided code, `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is already defined as `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. The initial state mentions that `min_diff` is currently equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the new value of `min_diff` will reflect the absolute difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[3]`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements; `target` is an integer; `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`; `i` is 2; `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])**
