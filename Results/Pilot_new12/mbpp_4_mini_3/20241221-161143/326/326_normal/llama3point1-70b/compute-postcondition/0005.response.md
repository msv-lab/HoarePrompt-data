The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. Since the current value of `diff` is less than `min_diff`, after this assignment, `min_diff` will now be equal to the previous value of `diff`. 

Other variables such as `arr`, `target`, `i` remain unchanged in terms of their values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to the previous value of `diff`, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])**.
