The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between the two elements of `arr` at indices `i` and `i + 1`. Given that `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are valid integers. The values of `arr`, `target`, `min_diff`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the newly calculated value of `diff`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`.**
