The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`, where `i` is initially 2. Therefore, `diff` becomes `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. The previous values of the affected variables remain the same, but `diff` will now reflect this new computation.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `i` is 2, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3]) (updated)**
