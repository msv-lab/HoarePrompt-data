The operation `min_diff = float('inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to `min_diff`. This means that `min_diff` now has a definitive value, which allows it to be used for comparisons to find the minimum difference later on. The other variables, `arr` (which remains a sorted list of integers) and `target` (which stays as an integer), are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers; `target` is an integer; `min_diff` is positive infinity.**
