Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where `n`, the second parameter passed to the function `func_1`, exceeds the length of the given array `arr`. According to the problem description, `n` should represent the number of elements in the array, and if `n` is larger than the actual length of `arr`, there is a potential for an IndexError or misleading results.

For instance, if you pass `func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 7)`, where `n` (7) is greater than the length of `arr` (6), the program operates as if the length of `arr` were valid, but it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

Additionally, the function defaults to returning 0 if `n` is less than 2, which is correct, but it does not account properly for cases where the input array might be smaller than expected, based on the value of `n`. Thus, the lack of validation regarding the relationship between `n` and the length of `arr` indicates the function does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
