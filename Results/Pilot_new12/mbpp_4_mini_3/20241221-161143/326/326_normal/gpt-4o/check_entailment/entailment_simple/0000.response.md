Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. Here are the key points that confirm its correctness:

1. **Input Validation**: The function checks if `n`, the length of the array, is less than 2. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. This is a sensible approach since the minimum difference cannot be calculated with fewer than two elements.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The function sorts the array, which is necessary to calculate the minimum difference effectively. By sorting the array, the function can accurately compare only consecutive elements to find the minimum difference.

3. **Finding the Minimum Difference**: The function iterates through the sorted array, calculating the difference between consecutive elements. It maintains the smallest difference found in the variable `min_diff`. This logic correctly implements the idea of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the sorted array.

4. **Correct Return Value**: Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list. This directly addresses the problem stated, which is to find the minimum difference between any two elements.

Overall, the function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles valid input correctly. Therefore, the program is indeed correct.
