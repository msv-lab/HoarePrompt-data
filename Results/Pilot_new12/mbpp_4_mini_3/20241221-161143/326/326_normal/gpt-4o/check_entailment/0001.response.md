Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the task of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

### Explanation:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2. If so, it returns 0, which correctly indicates that the minimum difference cannot be defined with fewer than two elements.
  
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the input array. This is essential because the minimum difference between any two distinct elements will be found among adjacent elements in a sorted list.

3. **Calculating Differences**: The program calculates the difference between each adjacent pair of elements in the sorted array and tracks the minimum difference found.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case `func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6)`, the sorted array is `[1, 3, 5, 18, 19, 25]`, and the minimum difference is `1` (between `1` and `3`).
   - In the second test case `func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4)`, the sorted array is `[2, 3, 4, 6]`, resulting in a minimum difference of `1` (between `2` and `3`).
   - The third test case `func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4)` leads to a sorted array of `[5, 9, 20, 30]`, with a minimum difference of `4` (between `5` and `9`).

The program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles various potential inputs correctly. Thus, there are no issues with the implementation, confirming its correctness.
