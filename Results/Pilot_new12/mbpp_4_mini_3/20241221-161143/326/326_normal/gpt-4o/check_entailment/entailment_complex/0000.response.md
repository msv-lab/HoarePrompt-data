Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the function is supposed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the implementation only calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

This means that the function fails in the general case where the minimum difference may not necessarily occur between consecutive elements after sorting. For example, consider the array `(1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25)`. The minimum difference (which is 1) occurs between the elements 18 and 19, but the program's logic only considers consecutive pairs in the sorted array, which may miss other smaller differences.

In conclusion, while the function may work correctly for some test cases, it does not universally meet the requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the provided array.
