Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input array has fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, it states to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. If there are not at least two elements in the array, it should be impossible to calculate a difference. 

Specifically, the line `if n < 2: return 0` incorrectly returns `0` as the minimum difference instead of an indication of impossibility (which could be an error message, exception, or potentially returning `None`). Thus, the program fails to comply with the requirement of the problem for the input cases of length 0 or 1. For example:
- Input: `([], 0)` should ideally have some form of signal indicating invalid input since there are no elements to compare.
- Input: `([1], 1)` should likewise signal an invalid input having only one element.

Because of this oversight, the program is incorrect.
