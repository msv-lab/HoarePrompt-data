#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 since the current value of n is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= len(`arr`), and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `min_diff` is equal to the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or greater, it sorts the list `arr` and calculates the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list, returning this minimum difference. The function does not account for the case where `n` exceeds the length of `arr`, which could lead to an IndexError. Additionally, if `arr` is empty or contains a single element, the function will still return 0 as `n` assumes a valid range. Therefore, the final state of the program reflects either the smallest difference between consecutive integers or 0 under applicable conditions.
