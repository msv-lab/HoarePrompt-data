`min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and `n` remains greater than 2, `i` stays as 2, and `diff` retains its definition based on the values in `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2] and min_diff is equal to `diff`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`**.
