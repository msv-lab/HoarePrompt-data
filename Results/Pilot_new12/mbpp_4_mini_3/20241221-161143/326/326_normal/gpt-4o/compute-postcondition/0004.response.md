The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to `min_diff`. This means `min_diff` is initialized to represent infinity (a very large number). The previous values and states of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= len(`arr`), and `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `min_diff` is infinity.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= len(`arr`), and `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `min_diff` is infinity.**
