The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. Since `i` is currently 2, this means `diff` will be computed as `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The states of the other variables `arr`, `n`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]**.
