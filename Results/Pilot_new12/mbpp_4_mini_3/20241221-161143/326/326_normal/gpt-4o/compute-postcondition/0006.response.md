The value of `diff` is assigned the result of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. The state of `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and the current value of `i` is 0. Therefore, `diff` will be equal to the first difference in the sorted list of integers. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. So, the output state is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is infinity, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]**.
