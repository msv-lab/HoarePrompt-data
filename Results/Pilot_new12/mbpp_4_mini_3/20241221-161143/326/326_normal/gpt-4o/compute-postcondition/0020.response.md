The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr` which is a list of integers, and a parameter `n` which is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is 2 or greater, the function returns the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `n`, returning 0 if `n` is less than 2, or the smallest difference between consecutive elements in the sorted `arr` if `n` is 2 or greater. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr (a list of integers) and a parameter n (a non-negative integer). It returns 0 if n is less than 2; otherwise, it returns the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list arr.**
