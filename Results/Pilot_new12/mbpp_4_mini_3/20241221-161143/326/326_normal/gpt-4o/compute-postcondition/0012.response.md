`min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The previous value of `min_diff` was equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]**
