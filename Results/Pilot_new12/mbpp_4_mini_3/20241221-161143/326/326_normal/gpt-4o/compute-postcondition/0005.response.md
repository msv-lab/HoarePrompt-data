According to the code, the for loop iterates from 0 to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, which means `n - 1` must be at least 1. Given that `arr` is a sorted list of integers and `n` is already confirmed to be greater than or equal to 2, this requirement is satisfied.

The loop control variable `i` starts at 0 for the first iteration. Thus, thereâ€™s no need for adjustment to the initial states of `arr`, `n`, or `min_diff`.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is infinity, `i` is 0**
