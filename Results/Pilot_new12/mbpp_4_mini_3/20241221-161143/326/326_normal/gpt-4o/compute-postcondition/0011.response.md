The value of `diff` is assigned the result of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Since `i` is 1, this means we are computing `diff` as `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The previous value of `min_diff` was `arr[1] - arr[0]`, and `n` ensures there are sufficient elements in `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 1, and `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
