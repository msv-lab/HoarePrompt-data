The value of `min_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff`. Given that `diff` is calculated as `arr[1] - arr[0]`, and is currently less than `min_diff`, the value of `min_diff` will now be equal to this specific difference. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`**.
