According to the code, the loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is 2 or more. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1, making it 2. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue, we need `n` to be at least 3. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 and `i` must be 2.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
