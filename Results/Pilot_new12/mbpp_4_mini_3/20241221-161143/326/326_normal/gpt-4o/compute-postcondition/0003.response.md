The code `arr = sorted(arr)` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Since `arr` is a list of integers and the initial state allows it to vary in length, the specific arrangement of integers within `arr` will be altered for the output state. The value of `n`, which specifies the number of elements that `arr` can contain, remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= len(`arr`), and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= len(`arr`), and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.**
