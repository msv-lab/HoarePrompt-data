The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or greater, it sorts the list `arr` and calculates the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list, returning this minimum difference. The function does not account for the case where `n` exceeds the length of `arr`, which could lead to an IndexError. Additionally, if `arr` is empty or contains a single element, the function will still return 0 as `n` assumes a valid range. Therefore, the final state of the program reflects either the smallest difference between consecutive integers or 0 under applicable conditions.
