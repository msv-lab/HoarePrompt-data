Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. While the function `func_1(list_of_lists)` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in ascending order, the expected results in the assertions are incorrect for some cases.

Looking specifically at the first assertion:

```python
assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
```

The correct output should be:

```
[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
```

However, when sorted, the last sublist `['white', 'black', 'orange']` should yield `['black', 'orange', 'white']`, not `['black', 'orange', 'white']` as represented in the expected output. The correct expected output for `func_1((['white', 'black', 'orange']))` would be `['black', 'orange', 'white']`, but the expectation indicates that this result is not accurately represented.

Additionally, closer examination shows that the second assertion contains no sorting issues, as `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]` when expected becomes `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]` and is correct.

Finally, the third assertion also fails because the expected output is not correctly sorted. The corrected tuples should yield:

```python
[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]
```

In essence, while the function itself performs the sorting correctly, the expected output specified in the assertions does not align with the actual sorted values produced by the function, rendering the overall correctness false. Therefore, while the function implements the required logic, the mismatch in expectations leads to a conclusion that it ultimately does not meet the problem description accurately.
