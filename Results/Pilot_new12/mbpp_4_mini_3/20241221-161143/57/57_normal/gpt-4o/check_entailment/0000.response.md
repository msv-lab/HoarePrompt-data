To determine the correctness of the provided program, I need to analyze if it accurately sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists according to the problem description. The program contains a function `func_1` that is supposed to achieve this sorting.

The function iterates through each sublist within the `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function, which arranges the strings in lexicographical order.

Let's delve into the problem description and provided test cases:

1. The input `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])` is expected to produce `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. This is incorrect because the sorted sublist `['white', 'black', 'orange']` should be `['black', 'orange', 'white']` after sorting.
   
2. The input `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])` should return `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`. However, the sorted result would give `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' brown', ' orange']]` if sorted correctly.

3. The input `(['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])` is expected to produce `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`. This is correctly sorted as `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`.

The function fails to sort sublists correctly as illustrated by the discrepancies in the expected outputs and the behavior of the actual sorting performed by `sorted()`. In addition, the program does not handle leading or trailing spaces consistently.

Given that the first two cases do not match the expected outputs from the description, the function cannot be considered correct for the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.
