The original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect, supported by analyses of the provided test cases which have discrepancies between expected and actual outputs. Specifically, the sorting logic does not align with the expectations outlined in the problem description. The program is supposed to sort each sublist of strings lexicographically; however, it also appears to fail in cases with spaces leading to incorrect sorting orders. 

The output hints reinforce that the function is intended to accept a valid `list_of_lists` and return sorted sublists, including handling edge cases such as empty sublists. However, this does not mitigate the foundational problem where the sorting produces unexpected results based on the provided examples.

Considering all the information given:

1. The test cases where the function is supposed to sort the strings do not yield correct results, as highlighted in the original assessment.
2. The inherent behavior of `sorted()` correctly maintains empty sublists, which aligns with the output hints, but that does not correct the flawed behavior demonstrated in the examples.

Thus, the reasoning in the original assessment holds valid: the program fails to meet the problem's specifications due to incorrect outputs from the defined test cases.

Final: **False**
