The original assessment indicates that the program does not accurately sort the sublists of strings according to the provided problem description. Upon evaluating the problem description, the code, and the annotations, here are the findings:

1. The function `func_1` applies the `sorted()` function correctly on each sublist within the `list_of_lists`. This should yield the lexicographically sorted sublists.

2. The first test case `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])` is indeed expected to produce the result `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, but the sorted version of `['white', 'black', 'orange']` is `['black', 'orange', 'white']`. Therefore, the expected assertion is incorrect.

3. In the second test case `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])`, the output, when processed through `sorted()`, would produce `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' brown', ' orange']]`, which is again inconsistent with its expected output. 

4. The third case `(['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])` is correctly sorted as `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`.

The reasoning provided in the original assessment is accurate. The program fails to meet the expectations set forth in the problem description due to incorrect expected outputs in the assertions. It is clear that the sorted results from the function do not match the expected assertions.

Thus, after reviewing the annotations and reassessing the program's correctness regarding the consistency with the problem description and the original assessment, it is determined that the original assessment correctly identifies that the program's functionality does not align with the expectations.

Final: **False**.
