Final: **False** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not consistently fulfill the problem description due to failures in some test cases, specifically with case sensitivity and whitespace handling in the second assertion. The program's use of `sorted` does not account for variations in case or leading/trailing whitespace, which leads to incorrect sorting results. Additionally, even though output hints clarify that the function handles empty sublists or an empty outer list correctly, they do not negate the issues with the sorting logic itself. Thus, the overall conclusion about the program's correctness remains accurate - the program fails to consistently sort strings as required.
