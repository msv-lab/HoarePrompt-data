You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, I need to analyze if it accurately sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists according to the problem description. The program contains a function `func_1` that is supposed to achieve this sorting.

The function iterates through each sublist within the `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function, which arranges the strings in lexicographical order.

Let's delve into the problem description and provided test cases:

1. The input `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])` is expected to produce `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. This is incorrect because the sorted sublist `['white', 'black', 'orange']` should be `['black', 'orange', 'white']` after sorting.
   
2. The input `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])` should return `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`. However, the sorted result would give `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' brown', ' orange']]` if sorted correctly.

3. The input `(['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])` is expected to produce `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`. This is correctly sorted as `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`.

The function fails to sort sublists correctly as illustrated by the discrepancies in the expected outputs and the behavior of the actual sorting performed by `sorted()`. In addition, the program does not handle leading or trailing spaces consistently.

Given that the first two cases do not match the expected outputs from the description, the function cannot be considered correct for the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. It returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. This includes handling potential edge cases such as empty sublists (which remain empty) and ensures that the overall structure is preserved as a list of lists. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return an empty list. The annotations correctly describe the main action of the function but do not explicitly address the handling of empty sublists or the scenario where the outer list may be empty, though the code covers these cases inherently.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
