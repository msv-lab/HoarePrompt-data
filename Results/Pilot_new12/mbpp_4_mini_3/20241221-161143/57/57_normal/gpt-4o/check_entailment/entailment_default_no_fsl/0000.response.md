Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not handle the case of strings with leading or trailing spaces correctly. For instance, in the assertion:
```python
assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) 
```
the expected output is `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`, but when the `sorted()` function is applied, it will sort the sublist to `[[' green', ' red '], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`, which does not match the expected output. 

Additionally, while the output hints mention handling empty sublists and an empty main list correctly, the incorrect handling of leading/trailing spaces means that the function fails to output correct results for all potential cases as per the problem description. Thus, the function cannot be considered correct for every potential case.
