You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function and the test cases one by one.

### Problem Description
The requirement is to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.

### Program Analysis
The function defined is:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

This function uses a list comprehension to apply the `sorted` function to each sublist within `list_of_lists`. 

### Test Cases
The program includes assertions for the following test cases:

1. **Case 1:**
   ```python
   assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
   ```
   - Expected: `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`
   - Actual after sorting: `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`
   - This assertion passes.

2. **Case 2:**
   ```python
   assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
   ```
   - Expected: `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`
   - Actual after sorting: `[[' red ', ' green'], [' black', ' blue '], [' brown', ' orange']]` (This is actually not the expected output.)
   - The sorting incorrectly transforms the order due to leading and trailing spaces. 

3. **Case 3:**
   ```python
   assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]
   ```
   - Expected: `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`
   - Actual after sorting: `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`
   - This assertion passes.

### Edge Case Analysis
Considering edge cases, one potential edge case would be sublists that contain strings with leading/trailing spaces, empty strings, or mixed casing. The program does not handle these scenarios gracefully:

For example, if we have:
```python
assert func_1((['apple', ' Banana'], ['Cherry', 'apple ', 'banana'])) 
```
Expected output would generally consider case and leading spaces when sorting strings but the current implementation uses `sorted` which treats space and case differently, leading to incorrect orders when normalizing string comparison isnâ€™t applied.

The presence of such potential misordered outputs indicates that the initial implementation does not fully adhere to the expected sorting behavior.

### Conclusion
Given these observations, particularly with test case 2 failing and potential issues with leading/trailing spaces and casing discrepancies, the function does not consistently meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. It returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. This includes handling potential edge cases such as empty sublists (which remain empty) and ensures that the overall structure is preserved as a list of lists. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return an empty list. The annotations correctly describe the main action of the function but do not explicitly address the handling of empty sublists or the scenario where the outer list may be empty, though the code covers these cases inherently.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
