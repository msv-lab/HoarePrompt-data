The analysis provided in the original assessment appropriately identifies issues with the program's correctness. While the function `func_1` appears to execute without errors and seems to sort the sublists, it does not correctly meet the expectations set by the problem description in all cases, particularly regarding how leading/trailing spaces and different string cases are handled.

Based on the annotated version, the expected output for certain test cases is shown explicitly, and it's clear that the second test case fails to meet the expectation as leading spaces influence the sorting outcome. Specifically, the annotated state of the program before the function call is that the input `list_of_lists` is valid, yet it does not account for nuances of string comparison regarding spaces, which affects the sort order.

Given that the expected output in the second assertion does not match the actual output obtained from the function call (i.e., the sorted lists differ in their arrangement due to leading spaces), it highlights a flaw in how the function handles sorting.

The original assessment states that the function does not fully adhere to expected sorting behavior, which aligns with the evidence provided through both the test cases and the annotations. Therefore, I will maintain this stance.

Final: **False**
