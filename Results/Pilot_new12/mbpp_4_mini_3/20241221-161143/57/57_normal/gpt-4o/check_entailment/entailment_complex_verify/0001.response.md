Given the problem description, the program's purpose is to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The initial assessment identified crucial issues with how the function performs sorting on strings, especially concerning leading/trailing spaces affecting the order.

After evaluating the annotated version, the following points were noted:

1. **Correct Sorting Logic**: The core functionality of `func_1` utilizes Python's built-in `sorted()` function correctly to sort sublists in ascending order.

2. **Issues with Leading and Trailing Spaces**: The assessment properly noted that the second test case fails due to leading/trailing spaces affecting string sorting, which impacts the output. The actual sorted output for that test case does not match the expected output due to the default behavior of string comparison.

3. **Unconsidered Edge Cases**: The annotated version claims that the program handles empty sublists and will return an empty list for an empty input correctly, but it does not address the improper handling of strings with spaces well enough in the logic assessment.

4. **Output Discrepancy**: Since the assertions do not hold for all test cases, particularly the second one where the output does not match the expected result, it leads to the overall conclusion that the function does not meet the requirements as outlined in the problem description.

Considering these factors reaffirms that the original assessment correctly identified that the function does not consistently meet the problem requirements due to its failure to account for leading spaces in the strings.

Final: **False**
