The code provided performs sorting for each sublist within a list of lists correctly. It iterates over each sublist in the provided list and uses Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort the strings in ascending order. 

The output hints state that the function handles potential edge cases such as empty sublists (which remain empty) and that an empty outer list will return an empty list. The implementation indeed behaves correctly for the cases presented in the output hints regarding the sorting of strings since it sorts each sublist without modifying the overall structure of the input list.

However, the output hints do not detail how the function handles cases where strings might have leading or trailing whitespace, or how the sorting is case-sensitive (where 'apple' would be sorted differently than 'Apple'). While this is not explicitly mentioned in the hints, these could be considered edge cases that might not be desired depending on specific sorting requirements (like ignoring case and whitespace).

Overall, in the context provided and under the assumption that we process inputs as valid, the program appears to meet the requirements laid out in the problem description for typical cases.

Correctness: **True**.
