Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to incorrect assertions in the annotated assertions block. Specifically, the expected outputs for the first two assertions are incorrect:

1. For the first assertion:
   - Input: `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])`
   - The expected output should be: `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, but sorting the third sublist should yield: `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which is actually correct.
   
2. For the second assertion:
   - Input: `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])`
   - The expected output should be: `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' brown', 'orange']]`, but the given expected output: `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]` is incorrect because it doesn't follow the sorting of strings correctly.

3. For the third assertion:
   - The expected output of the sorted lists matches the sort operation as expected.

Overall, while the function itself correctly sorts the sublists, the assertions do not reflect the accurate expected outputs for the first two cases, which means the full functionality cannot be deemed correct based on the provided assertions. 

In summary, because the assertions do not correctly validate the sorting functionality of the implemented function according to the problem description, the program is deemed incorrect.
