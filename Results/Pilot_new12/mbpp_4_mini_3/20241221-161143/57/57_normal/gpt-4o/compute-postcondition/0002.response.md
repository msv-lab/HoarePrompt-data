Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. It returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. This includes handling potential edge cases such as empty sublists (which remain empty) and ensures that the overall structure is preserved as a list of lists. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return an empty list. The annotations correctly describe the main action of the function but do not explicitly address the handling of empty sublists or the scenario where the outer list may be empty, though the code covers these cases inherently.**
