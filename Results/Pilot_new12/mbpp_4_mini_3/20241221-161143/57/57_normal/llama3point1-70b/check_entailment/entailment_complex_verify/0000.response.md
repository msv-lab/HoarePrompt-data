The original assessment concludes that the program is not correct due to its inability to handle non-string elements, which would raise a TypeError at runtime. However, the provided annotations specify that the input to the function is expected to always be valid (a list of lists where each sublist contains strings). 

Given this assumption, the program adheres to the problem description by successfully sorting each sublist in a case-insensitive manner without raising errors under typical expected inputs. The annotations clarify that the function is intended to work within the bounds of its expected input, which is not only valid but consistently formatted.

Consequently, since the original assessment emphasized potential TypeErrors based on unexpected input types instead of relying on the guaranteed valid input as specified, the original concern is less relevant.

Thus, I will refine the assessment based on the clarity of the annotated version and the explicit assumption about valid input:

Final: **True**.
