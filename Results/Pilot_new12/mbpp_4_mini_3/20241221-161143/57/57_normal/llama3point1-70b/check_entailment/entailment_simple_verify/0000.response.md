Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description. The annotations confirm that the program operates under the assumption that its input consists exclusively of lists of strings, which aligns with the premise that the input will be valid and will not cause errors. The edge cases analyzed in the original assessment address scenarios that do not violate the input constraints specified in the problem description, reinforcing the conclusion that the program is correct within its expected domain. Thus, the program meets the specified requirements, and the final assessment remains as stated.
