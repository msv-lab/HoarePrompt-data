Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists according to the problem description. The sorting is done using `sorted()` with `key=str.lower`, which ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive. 

Let's consider some potential edge cases:

1. An empty list of lists: `func_1([])` returns `[]` which is correct.
2. A sublist containing strings of different cases: `func_1([['banana', 'Apple', 'cherry']])` returns `[['Apple', 'banana', 'cherry']]`, correctly sorting them.
3. A sublist with mixed data types (though technically it should be a list of lists of strings): `func_1([[1, 'apple', 'banana']])` would raise an error because `1` is not a string. This case is out of scope since the input is expected to be a list of strings, so we assume that all sublists only contain strings.

Thus, the function meets the requirements and handles typical edge cases correctly. Since I couldn't find a single case in which the program fails to meet the description, I conclude that the program is correct.
