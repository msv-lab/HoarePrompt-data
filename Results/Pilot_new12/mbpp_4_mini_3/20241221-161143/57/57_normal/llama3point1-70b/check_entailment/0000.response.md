To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the code, its logic, and potential edge cases.

Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.

Program:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

The function processes a list of lists (i.e., `list_of_lists`) and sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner using `str.lower` as the sorting key.

Now, let's consider any potential edge cases:

1. **Empty input**: If `list_of_lists` is an empty list (`[]`), the function would return an empty list, which is correct.

2. **Empty Sublists**: If one of the sublists is empty (e.g., `[[], ['b', 'a']]`), the program would return `[[], ['a', 'b']]`, which is also correct.

3. **Single element sublists**: A case like `[["a"], ["B"]]` would yield `[["a"], ["B"]]`, which retains the original order since there's nothing to sort.

4. **Mixed case substrings**: A case like `[["b", "A", "c"]]` should yield `[['A', 'b', 'c']]`, which demonstrates that sorting is functioning correctly based on case insensitivity.

5. **Non-string elements**: If the input includes non-string types (e.g., `[[1, 2], ["b", "A"]]`), the code would raise a TypeError, as sorting will attempt to compare strings with integers.

After considering these points, we can conclude:

- The function works correctly for valid inputs of lists of strings.
- It does not handle cases where the elements within the sublists are not all strings, which would cause an error and is outside the expected domain of the function (i.e., the problem description does not clarify this).

Thus, since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly with non-string elements leading to a runtime error, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
