Final: **True** 

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The provided function `func_1` successfully sorts each sublist of strings in a list of lists as per the problem description. The use of `sorted()` with `key=str.lower` ensures appropriate case-insensitive sorting. 

The output hints clarify that the function does not handle cases of empty input or lists with non-string items, but they also confirm the assumption that valid input will be provided. Thus, since the function performs correctly under the expected conditions outlined, the assessment of correctness is maintained. The function meets the requirements laid out in the problem description by returning a new list of lists with sorted sublists without modifying the original input.
