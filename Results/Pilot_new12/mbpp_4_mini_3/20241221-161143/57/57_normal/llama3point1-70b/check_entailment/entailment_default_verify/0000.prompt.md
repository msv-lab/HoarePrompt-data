You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the code, its logic, and potential edge cases.

Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.

Program:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

The function processes a list of lists (i.e., `list_of_lists`) and sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner using `str.lower` as the sorting key.

Now, let's consider any potential edge cases:

1. **Empty input**: If `list_of_lists` is an empty list (`[]`), the function would return an empty list, which is correct.

2. **Empty Sublists**: If one of the sublists is empty (e.g., `[[], ['b', 'a']]`), the program would return `[[], ['a', 'b']]`, which is also correct.

3. **Single element sublists**: A case like `[["a"], ["B"]]` would yield `[["a"], ["B"]]`, which retains the original order since there's nothing to sort.

4. **Mixed case substrings**: A case like `[["b", "A", "c"]]` should yield `[['A', 'b', 'c']]`, which demonstrates that sorting is functioning correctly based on case insensitivity.

5. **Non-string elements**: If the input includes non-string types (e.g., `[[1, 2], ["b", "A"]]`), the code would raise a TypeError, as sorting will attempt to compare strings with integers.

After considering these points, we can conclude:

- The function works correctly for valid inputs of lists of strings.
- It does not handle cases where the elements within the sublists are not all strings, which would cause an error and is outside the expected domain of the function (i.e., the problem description does not clarify this).

Thus, since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly with non-string elements leading to a runtime error, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing strings. It sorts each sublist in a case-insensitive manner and returns a new list of lists with the sorted sublists. It does not handle situations where `list_of_lists` may be empty or contain non-list elements, nor does it check for non-string items within the sublists. The final output is a new list of lists where all sublists are sorted without affecting the original input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
