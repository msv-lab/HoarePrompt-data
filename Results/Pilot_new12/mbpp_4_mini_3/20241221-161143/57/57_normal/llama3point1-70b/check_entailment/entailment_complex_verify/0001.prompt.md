You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists according to the problem description. The sorting is done using `sorted()` with `key=str.lower`, which ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive. 

Let's consider some potential edge cases:

1. An empty list of lists: `func_1([])` returns `[]` which is correct.
2. A sublist containing strings of different cases: `func_1([['banana', 'Apple', 'cherry']])` returns `[['Apple', 'banana', 'cherry']]`, correctly sorting them.
3. A sublist with mixed data types (though technically it should be a list of lists of strings): `func_1([[1, 'apple', 'banana']])` would raise an error because `1` is not a string. This case is out of scope since the input is expected to be a list of strings, so we assume that all sublists only contain strings.

Thus, the function meets the requirements and handles typical edge cases correctly. Since I couldn't find a single case in which the program fails to meet the description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner, based on the strings present in the original list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing strings. It sorts each sublist in a case-insensitive manner and returns a new list of lists with the sorted sublists. It does not handle situations where `list_of_lists` may be empty or contain non-list elements, nor does it check for non-string items within the sublists. The final output is a new list of lists where all sublists are sorted without affecting the original input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
