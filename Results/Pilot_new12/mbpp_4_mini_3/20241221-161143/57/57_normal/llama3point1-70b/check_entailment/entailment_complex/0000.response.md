Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly adheres to the problem description, which states that the function should sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing strings, as stated in the problem description.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The use of `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` means that each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner. The `key=str.lower` ensures that the sorting is not affected by the casing of the strings, aligning with typical expectations for string sorting where 'apple' and 'Apple' should be treated equally.

3. **Output Format**: The output of the function is a list comprehension that constructs a new list of lists where each original sublist has been sorted. This also conforms to the problem description which requests the output to be a list of lists.

4. **No Modification of Input**: The function returns a new list without altering the original input list, which follows the requirement of not affecting the original data.

5. **Assumptions about Input**: The program is expected to work correctly given valid inputs, as the problem description assumes that the input will always be valid. It seems to implicitly expect that all elements of `list_of_lists` are lists of strings, which matches the stated behavior.

Overall, since the function performs the required sorting operation as specified and meets all outlined criteria in the problem description, the correctness of the program is verified as true.
