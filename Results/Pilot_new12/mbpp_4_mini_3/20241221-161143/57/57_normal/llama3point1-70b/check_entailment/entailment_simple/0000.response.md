Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's the breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is indicated to be a list of lists, with each sublist containing strings.

2. **Sorting Mechanism**: The program utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`. Inside this comprehension, it calls the `sorted()` function, which sorts the strings in each sublist.

3. **Case-Insensitive Sorting**: The use of the `key=str.lower` in the `sorted()` function ensures that the sorting is done in a case-insensitive manner, aligning with typical expectations for sorting strings.

4. **Output Structure**: The result of the list comprehension is a new list containing each sorted sublist, which matches the output structure described in the problem descriptionâ€”a list of lists where each sublist is sorted.

Since the function adheres to the specifications and the assumption of valid input, it correctly implements the requirement to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. Thus, the program is deemed correct.
