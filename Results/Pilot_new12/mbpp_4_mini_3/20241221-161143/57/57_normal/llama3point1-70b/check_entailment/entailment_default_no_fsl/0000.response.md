Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the following potential cases mentioned in the output hints: 

1. It does not check for empty `list_of_lists`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not handled.
2. It also does not check for non-list elements within `list_of_lists`. If any element in `list_of_lists` is not a list, it would raise an error when trying to sort it as the code assumes every sublist is a valid list.
3. Furthermore, it assumes that all elements within the sublists are strings, which may not always be the case.

These scenarios indicate that the program is not robust and thus would fail under certain inputs. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description's requirement to handle all potential cases correctly.
