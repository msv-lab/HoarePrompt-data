The function takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing strings. It sorts each sublist in a case-insensitive manner and returns a new list of lists with the sorted sublists. It does not handle situations where `list_of_lists` may be empty or contain non-list elements, nor does it check for non-string items within the sublists. The final output is a new list of lists where all sublists are sorted without affecting the original input.
