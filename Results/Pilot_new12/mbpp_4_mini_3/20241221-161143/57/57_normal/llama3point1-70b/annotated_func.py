#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner, based on the strings present in the original list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing strings. It sorts each sublist in a case-insensitive manner and returns a new list of lists with the sorted sublists. It does not handle situations where `list_of_lists` may be empty or contain non-list elements, nor does it check for non-string items within the sublists. The final output is a new list of lists where all sublists are sorted without affecting the original input.
