The code assigns a value to `end_pos`, which is calculated as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`. The value of `start_pos` is known to be greater than or equal to 0, and `len(sub_string)` will provide a positive integer since `sub_string` is a non-empty string. Thus, `end_pos` will be equal to `start_pos` plus some positive integer. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so we retain the conditions for `main_string`, `sub_string`, and `start_pos`.

Output State: **`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, `start_pos` is an index greater than or equal to 0, and `end_pos` is equal to `start_pos + len(sub_string)`**
