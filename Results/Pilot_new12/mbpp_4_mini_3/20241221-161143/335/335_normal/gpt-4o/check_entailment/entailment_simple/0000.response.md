Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the problem description correctly. According to the description, the function should find all occurrences and positions of the substring within the main string. However, the program only finds the first occurrence of the substring. Here are the issues:

1. **Single Occurrence**: The implementation of `func_1` only identifies and returns the first occurrence of the substring using the `find` method. It does not check for or provide any further occurrences if they exist.

2. **Missing Output for Multiple Occurrences**: If the substring appears multiple times in the main string, the program does not return any information about those additional occurrences â€” it entirely ignores them.

3. **Return Format**: The problem description implies that the function should return `None` if there are no matches, which the program does handle correctly; however, since it does not iterate through the string for multiple occurrences, it limits its utility.

The program needs to be modified to check for all occurrences of the substring and return the relevant information for each occurrence, or at least the first occurrence and any subsequent occurrences if that's what is intended by the problem description. 

Therefore, since the program only checks for and returns information about the first occurrence and thus does not meet the requirement of finding all occurrences, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements.
