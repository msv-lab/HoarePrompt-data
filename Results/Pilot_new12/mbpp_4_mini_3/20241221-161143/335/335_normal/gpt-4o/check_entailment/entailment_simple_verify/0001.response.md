The original assessment states that the program is "Correctness: **False**" because it does not handle all potential cases based on the problem description, specifically the occurrence of overlapping substrings and the lack of handling for multiple occurrences. 

After analyzing the provided annotations and the problem description, the program indeed only finds the first occurrence of a substring and does not account for subsequent occurrences. This means that in cases where multiple occurrences exist, such as in the input `func_1('python programming, python programming', 'python')`, it fails to provide the correct output as it ignores later occurrences. 

The annotations indicate that the program only executes a single search for the substring and returns the position of the first occurrence, which aligns with the original assessmentâ€™s reasoning. The program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description, which explicitly ask for the occurrences of substrings and their positions, allowing for the possibility of multiple findings.

Thus, the original assessment is supported by both the program's behavior and the provided annotations, confirming that the program does not satisfy the expectations laid out in the problem description.

Final: **False**
