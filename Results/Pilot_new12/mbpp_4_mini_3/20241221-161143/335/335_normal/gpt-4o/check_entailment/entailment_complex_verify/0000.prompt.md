You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to ensure that it meets all specified requirements and handles potential edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The function should find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string and return `None` if there is no match.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)
```

### Analysis:
- The program uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If the `sub_string` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function correctly returns `None`.
- If the `sub_string` is found, it calculates the starting and ending positions and returns a tuple containing the `sub_string`, its starting position, and its ending position.

### Checking for Edge Cases:
1. **Empty string:** What if `main_string` is empty? The function should ideally return `None` since no substring can be found.
   - `func_1('', 'python')` should return `None`, which the program does correctly.
  
2. **Empty substring:** If `sub_string` is empty, the `find` method will return `0`, indicating it is found at the beginning. However, the specification does not clarify how to handle this case.
   - `func_1('hello', '')` will return `('', 0, 0)`, which could potentially lead to misuse since the result does not indicate a match for a meaningful substring.

3. **String consisting of the substring:** When the entire `main_string` is equal to `sub_string`, it should return the correct positions.
   - `func_1('python', 'python')` should return `('python', 0, 6)`, which is correctly handled.

4. **Substrings occurring more than once:** The program only finds the first occurrence. This is aligned with the problem description, but we need to ensure that it does not miss any detail regarding "occurrence." As per the description, it seems to refer to finding a single position.

5. **Case sensitivity:** The `find` method is case-sensitive, so `func_1('Python', 'python')` should return `None`, which the program handles correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, while the function does handle many cases correctly, there seems to be a potential issue with how it handles an empty substring. Since the problem description does not specify how to handle it and one valid interpretation would be to return `None` for an empty substring:

Correctness: **False**. 

This program does not fulfill the requirements for potentially empty substrings in a clear manner based on common expectations.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_string is a string, sub_string is a non-empty string.
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if (start_pos == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that no value is found or returned from the operation.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a non-empty string, `start_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`, and `start_pos` is greater than or equal to 0.
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return sub_string, start_pos, end_pos
    #The program returns sub_string which is a non-empty string, start_pos which is an index greater than or equal to 0, and end_pos which is equal to start_pos + len(sub_string)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `main_string` and a non-empty string `sub_string`. It attempts to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is found, the function returns `sub_string`, the starting index of its first occurrence (`start_pos`), and the ending index (`end_pos`), which is calculated as the starting index plus the length of `sub_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, the function returns `None`. The function does not handle cases where `main_string` or `sub_string` are empty or if `sub_string` exceeds the length of `main_string`, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior. Furthermore, the function does not specify what should happen if the input types are incorrect (e.g., if a non-string is provided).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
