The provided program attempts to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string and returns None if there is no match. Upon examining the program and the output hints, we note the following:

1. The function correctly finds the starting index of the first occurrence of the substring and computes the ending index based on the length of the substring.
2. The given test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for the provided examples:
    - For valid cases, it returns the substring along with its starting and ending positions.
    - For cases when the substring is not found, it correctly returns None.

However, the output hints also indicate potential issues:
1. The function does not handle cases where either `main_string` or `sub_string` is empty, which, although outside the stated problem scope (assuming valid inputs), can lead to unexpected results if tested with such inputs.
2. The function does not manage cases where `sub_string` exceeds the length of `main_string`, which is logically inconsistent as this should return None since it cannot be found.
3. There is no check or handling for incorrect input types (e.g., if a non-string is provided), which might arise in a real-world scenario but is expected to be valid per the task.

Given that the function does not operate correctly under all potential circumstances outlined by the hints—as it does not specify behavior for empty strings and mismatched sizes—this indicates that it does not fulfill the problem requirements in every case.

Thus, since for at least one potential case the program does not work correctly, the assessment of the program's correctness is as follows:

Correctness: **False**.
