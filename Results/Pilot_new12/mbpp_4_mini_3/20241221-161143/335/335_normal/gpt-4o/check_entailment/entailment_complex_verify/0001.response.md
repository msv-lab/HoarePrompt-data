The original assessment determined the program's correctness as **False**, primarily citing the failure to handle overlapping substrings and the lack of functionality to find all occurrences of a given substring within a main string.

Based on the annotated version of the code, we can confirm the following:

1. The function `func_1` correctly returns the first occurrence of a specified substring within the main string along with its starting and ending positions. The return values are consistent with the problem's requirements for reporting the occurrence and position of a valid substring.

2. In terms of functionality, the function does **not** find multiple occurrences of the same substring in the main string. For any input where the substring occurs more than once, it will only report the first occurrence, which fails to meet the requirement outlined in the problem description to return all occurrences.

3. While the function does gracefully handle cases where the substring is not found by returning `None`, it does indeed fall short of fulfilling the complete requirement of the problem as it should be designed to find and report all occurrences, not just the first.

As such, the original assessment that the program's correctness is **False** remains valid. The criticisms regarding its inability to handle overlapping substrings, as well as not returning all occurrences, still hold true.

Final: **False**
