Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description in all potential scenarios. Specifically, the requirement states that the function should return `None` if there is no match. However, it does not specify what should happen if the input strings are empty. Although the assumption is made that the inputs will be valid, the lack of handling for empty strings can lead to unexpected behavior where an empty string might not be appropriately processed as described.

Furthermore, the annotations indicate that `sub_string` should always be a non-empty string, but the implementation does not enforce or check this condition. If `main_string` is empty or if `sub_string` is empty, the behavior of the function is not defined in the problem description. 

In summary, the function may fail or behave incorrectly if the input strings do not meet the expected conditions (e.g., if `main_string` is empty), which makes it not fully compliant with the problem definition. Thus, it cannot be deemed correct for every potential case as outlined.
