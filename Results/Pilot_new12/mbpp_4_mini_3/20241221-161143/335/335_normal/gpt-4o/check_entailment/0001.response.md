Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases based on the problem description. One prominent issue is that it does not account for overlapping substrings within the `main_string`. 

For example, consider the input:

```python
func_1('python programming, python programming', 'python')
```

In this case, there are two occurrences of the substring 'python'. The function correctly identifies the first occurrence, but it does not find the second occurrence, which is another valid instance that should be returned according to the problem description.

Additionally, the program only returns the first occurrence of the substring and ignores any subsequent occurrences. This means the function does not fully implement the requirement to find all occurrences and their positions within the string.

Because of this, the program fails to meet the detailed expectations set forth in the problem description.
