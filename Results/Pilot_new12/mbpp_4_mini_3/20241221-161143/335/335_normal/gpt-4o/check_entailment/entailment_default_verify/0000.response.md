Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program handles valid inputs (i.e., non-empty strings) according to the problem description. However, it also highlights a significant issue regarding how the function handles an empty substring, which is not explicitly defined in the problem description. The output hints reinforce that the function does not specify behavior for empty strings, which leads to output that differs from typical expectations (returning a tuple instead of `None`). This inconsistency indicates that the program does not fully satisfy the requirements, justifying the conclusion of **False**. 

Thus, while the function works for many cases, it does not handle all specified edge cases and may produce unexpected outputs under certain conditions, particularly with an empty substring.
