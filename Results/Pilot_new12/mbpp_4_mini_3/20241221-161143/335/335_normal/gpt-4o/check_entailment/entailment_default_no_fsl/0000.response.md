Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle several cases as specified in the problem description, particularly regarding empty strings. If either `main_string` or `sub_string` is empty, the behavior is not defined according to the code and could lead to unexpected results. For instance, if `sub_string` is empty and `main_string` is not, the program should return a tuple indicating that the empty substring is found at index 0, which it is not explicitly stated in the given functionality. Moreover, if `main_string` is empty and `sub_string` is not, the program returns `None`, but this situation is not clearly defined in the original problem description. Also, if the input types are not strings, the program wouldn't handle those cases properly either. Therefore, the function's inability to handle these edge cases means it does not meet all potential requirements.
