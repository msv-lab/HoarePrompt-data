To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to ensure that it meets all specified requirements and handles potential edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The function should find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string and return `None` if there is no match.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)
```

### Analysis:
- The program uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If the `sub_string` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function correctly returns `None`.
- If the `sub_string` is found, it calculates the starting and ending positions and returns a tuple containing the `sub_string`, its starting position, and its ending position.

### Checking for Edge Cases:
1. **Empty string:** What if `main_string` is empty? The function should ideally return `None` since no substring can be found.
   - `func_1('', 'python')` should return `None`, which the program does correctly.
  
2. **Empty substring:** If `sub_string` is empty, the `find` method will return `0`, indicating it is found at the beginning. However, the specification does not clarify how to handle this case.
   - `func_1('hello', '')` will return `('', 0, 0)`, which could potentially lead to misuse since the result does not indicate a match for a meaningful substring.

3. **String consisting of the substring:** When the entire `main_string` is equal to `sub_string`, it should return the correct positions.
   - `func_1('python', 'python')` should return `('python', 0, 6)`, which is correctly handled.

4. **Substrings occurring more than once:** The program only finds the first occurrence. This is aligned with the problem description, but we need to ensure that it does not miss any detail regarding "occurrence." As per the description, it seems to refer to finding a single position.

5. **Case sensitivity:** The `find` method is case-sensitive, so `func_1('Python', 'python')` should return `None`, which the program handles correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, while the function does handle many cases correctly, there seems to be a potential issue with how it handles an empty substring. Since the problem description does not specify how to handle it and one valid interpretation would be to return `None` for an empty substring:

Correctness: **False**. 

This program does not fulfill the requirements for potentially empty substrings in a clear manner based on common expectations.
