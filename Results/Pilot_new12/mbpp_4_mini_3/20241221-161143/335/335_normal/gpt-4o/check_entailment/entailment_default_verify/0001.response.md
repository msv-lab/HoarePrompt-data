The program `func_1` is designed to find the first occurrence of a substring within a string and return its starting and ending indices. The original assessment deemed the correctness of the program to be **False**, pointing out that the function does not account for overlapping substrings and fails to retrieve all occurrences of the substring.

Upon examining the problem description and output hints, we see that the program is expected to return only the first occurrence of a substring. This aligns with the existing functionality of `func_1`, which correctly identifies the first occurrence and its indices. The program returns the expected output of the substring along with its starting and ending positions for valid inputs and returns `None` for substrings not found in the main string.

However, the original assessment's concern about overlapping substrings and subsequent occurrences is based on an interpretation that may extend beyond the problem description's requirement. The problem does not explicitly state the need to find all occurrences or to handle overlapping substrings; it simply requires finding a substring and returning its position if it exists.

Given input cases that match the requirement outlined in the problem description, the program correctly identifies and returns the relevant information for only the first match, which is consistent with the stated functionality.

Therefore, the original assessment seems to misinterpret the scope of the problem description. The requirement appears to be to locate a single occurrence, hence the assessment should focus on the correctness of the given implementation in that context.

Given this analysis:

Final: **True**
