The program is intended to find all occurrences of a substring within a string and return their positions. However, the implementation only retrieves the first occurrence, which contradicts the problem description stating that all occurrences should be noted.

The original assessment correctly identifies this issue. The output hints confirm that the program only returns the first occurrence and does not handle multiple occurrences (or overlapping occurrences) of the substring. Specifically, the output hints note that the function performs a search for the first occurrence, returning a single resulting tuple, which is explicitly insufficient to satisfy the problem requirements.

Based on this analysis and the provided information, it is clear that the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the final assessment aligns with the original assessment.

Final: **False**
