The function provided, `func_1`, is designed to search for the first occurrence of a substring within a string and return relevant information. According to the output hints, the function returns a tuple when the substring is found and returns `None` if the substring isn't found. The return tuple includes the substring itself, the index of its first occurrence, and the index of its last occurrence.

However, based on the output hints, there are significant issues that indicate the program does not fulfill the problem description's requirements in every potential case.

1. **Handling of Overlapping Occurrences**: The output hints clearly state that the function does not consider overlapping occurrences of the substring. For instance, if the `string` is "aaa" and the `substring` is "aa", the expected behavior might be to find both occurrences (from indices 0 and 1). The function would only find the first occurrence at index 0 and return `(substring, 0, 1)` without considering the overlapping nature.

2. **Non-Empty Assumption**: The function assumes that both parameters are non-empty, which contradicts the design of a flexible function. If either string is empty, this should ideally be handled gracefully, but since the problem description assumes valid inputs, we need to focus on their behaviors instead.

The combination of these factors leads to the conclusion that the function does not fully comply with the problem requirements because it handles some expected cases inadequately, and there are potential scenarios that it does not properly address.

Correctness: **False**.
