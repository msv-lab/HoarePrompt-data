Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the substring occurs multiple times within the string. According to the problem description, the function should find all occurrences and their positions, but the current implementation only returns the first occurrence. For example:

```python
string = "ababc"
substring = "ab"
```

In this case, the expected output should be all occurrences of "ab", which are at positions (0, 1) and (2, 3). However, the program would only return `(substring, 0, 1)`, missing the second occurrence completely.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements of finding all occurrences and their positions.
