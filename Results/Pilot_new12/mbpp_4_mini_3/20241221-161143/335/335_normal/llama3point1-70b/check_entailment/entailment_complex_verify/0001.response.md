Final: **False**

The original assessment is correct. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which specifies that it should find all occurrences and their positions of the substring within the string. The provided function only finds the first occurrence due to the use of the `string.find()` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence. 

The annotated version of the code corroborates this by explaining that when the substring is found, the function only retrieves the starting and ending indices of the first occurrence, completely ignoring any subsequent occurrences. The annotations also mention that the function does not consider overlapping occurrences of the substring, which further supports the assertion that the implementation is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Thus, based on the problem description, the assessment stands firm: the function does not fulfill the task it was designed for.
