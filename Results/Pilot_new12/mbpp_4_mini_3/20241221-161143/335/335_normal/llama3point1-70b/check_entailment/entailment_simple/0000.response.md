Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the problem description requirements. It only finds the first occurrence of the substring in the string and returns the position (start and end index) for that single occurrence. However, the problem description specifies that the function should find the occurrence and position of *all* occurrences of the substrings within the string. The current implementation will return `None` if the substring is not found, which is acceptable, but it does not provide any information about additional occurrences if they exist.

To fulfill the problem description, the program should iterate through the string to find all occurrences of the substring and return their positions. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement of the task as it only handles the first occurrence and does not gather all matches if there are multiple occurrences.
