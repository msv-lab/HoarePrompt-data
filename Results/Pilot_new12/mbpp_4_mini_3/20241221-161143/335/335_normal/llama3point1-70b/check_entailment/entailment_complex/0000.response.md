Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function that searches for the first occurrence of a given substring within a non-empty string. If the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the substring, the starting index of its first occurrence, and the ending index of its last occurrence (calculated correctly). If the substring is not found, the function correctly returns `None`.

Key points that confirm the correctness against the problem description:
1. The function accepts two non-empty strings, as specified.
2. It successfully finds the first occurrence of the substring within the string using the `find()` method, returning `None` when there is no match, which aligns with the problem description.
3. When the substring is found, it returns the required information (the substring, starting index, and ending index).
4. The program does not handle empty strings, but as per the assumption, the input will always be valid and non-empty, thus the requirement is satisfied.
5. It does not consider overlapping occurrences, but the problem description does not mandate handling overlaps, so this does not violate the requirements.

Therefore, the program faithfully implements the functionality demanded by the problem description.
