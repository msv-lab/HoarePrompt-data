Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which states that the function should find all occurrences and their positions of the substring within a string. The current implementation only returns the first occurrence and ignores any subsequent occurrences. 

The annotated version confirms that the program only handles the case of finding the first occurrence of the substring and returning its position, as it specifically indicates that the function relies on the presence of the non-empty parameters and clearly states that it does not consider overlapping occurrences of the substring. Therefore, since the program fails to provide complete functionality as required by the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is indeed incorrect.
