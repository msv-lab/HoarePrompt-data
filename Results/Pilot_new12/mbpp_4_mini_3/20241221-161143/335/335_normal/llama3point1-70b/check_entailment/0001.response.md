Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the substring in the string. According to the problem description, it should find all occurrences and their positions, but the given function only finds the first occurrence due to the use of the `string.find()` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. 

For example:
- If the input is `func_1("ababab", "ab")`, the expected output should include all occurrences of "ab" and their respective positions, but the function will only return `('ab', 0, 1)`.

Therefore, since the program does not adhere to the requirement of finding all occurrences, it is incorrect.
