Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, while it correctly finds the first occurrence of a substring and returns its starting and ending indices, it fails to consider overlapping occurrences of the substring. 

For example, if the input `string` is `"abab"` and the `substring` is `"ab"`, the correct behavior would account for both occurrences of `"ab"` in the given stringâ€”starting at index 0 and index 2. However, the current implementation will only return the first occurrence, which is not sufficient based on the requirements stated. 

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where both `string` and `substring` are non-empty but `substring` is longer than `string`, which logically should return `None`. 

Thus, there are cases where the function does not work as expected, rendering it incorrect.
