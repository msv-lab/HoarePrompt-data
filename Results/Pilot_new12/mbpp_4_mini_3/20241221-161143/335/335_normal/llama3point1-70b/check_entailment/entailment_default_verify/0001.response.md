The program `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. However, the problem description clearly requires the identification of all occurrences of the substring, whereas the original code only locates the first occurrence using the `string.find()` method. The function returns a tuple containing the substring and the indices of its first occurrence but does not handle cases where the substring appears multiple times.

The output hints further specify that the function only returns the first match and neglects overlapping occurrences, which is a clear discrepancy from the problem description. This understanding aligns closely with the original assessment indicating that the program's correctness is **False** because it does not meet the requirement of finding all occurrences and their positions.

Since the output hints reinforce this idea and the function does not fulfill the outlined expectations of the problem, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
