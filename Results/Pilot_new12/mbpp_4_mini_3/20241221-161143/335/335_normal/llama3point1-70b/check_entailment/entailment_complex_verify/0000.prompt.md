You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the substring occurs multiple times within the string. According to the problem description, the function should find all occurrences and their positions, but the current implementation only returns the first occurrence. For example:

```python
string = "ababc"
substring = "ab"
```

In this case, the expected output should be all occurrences of "ab", which are at positions (0, 1) and (2, 3). However, the program would only return `(substring, 0, 1)`, missing the second occurrence completely.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements of finding all occurrences and their positions.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a non-empty string, and substring is a non-empty string.
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if (start == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that the value is not present as 'substring' is not found in 'string'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, and `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, with `start` being greater than or equal to 0.
    end = start + len(substring)
    return substring, start, end - 1
    #The program returns substring, start, and end - 1, where 'substring' is a non-empty string, 'start' is the index of the first occurrence of 'substring' in 'string', and 'end' is equal to 'start + len(substring)'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both non-empty strings. It searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found, the function returns None, indicating its absence. If `substring` is found, the function returns a tuple containing `substring`, the index of its first occurrence (`start`), and the index of its last occurrence in `string` (`end - 1`, calculated as the starting index plus the length of `substring` minus one). It is important to note that the function relies on the presence of both parameters being non-empty; if they are empty, this may lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not consider overlapping occurrences of `substring`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
