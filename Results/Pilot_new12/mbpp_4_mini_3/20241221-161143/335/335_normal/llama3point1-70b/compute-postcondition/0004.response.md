The variable `end` is assigned the value of `start` plus the length of `substring`. The previous value of `start` is known and is greater than or equal to 0, and since `substring` is a non-empty string, its length is at least 1. Thus, `end` will be equal to `start + len(substring)`, which means `end` will also be at least 1 greater than or equal to `start`.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `end` is equal to `start + len(substring)`**.
