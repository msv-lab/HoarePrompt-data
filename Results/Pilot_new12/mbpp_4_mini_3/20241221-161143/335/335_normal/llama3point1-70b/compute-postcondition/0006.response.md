The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. Both `string` and `substring` are non-empty strings. If the `substring` is not found within `string`, the function returns `None`. If the `substring` is found, the function returns `substring`, the starting index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and the index one position past the end of `substring`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-empty strings, `string` and `substring`, and return information about the presence and location of `substring` within `string`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both non-empty strings. It returns None if `substring` is not found in `string`; otherwise, it returns `substring`, the start index of its first occurrence, and the end index.**
