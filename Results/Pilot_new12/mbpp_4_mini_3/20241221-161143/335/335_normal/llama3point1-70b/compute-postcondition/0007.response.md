Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both non-empty strings. It searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found, the function returns None, indicating its absence. If `substring` is found, the function returns a tuple containing `substring`, the index of its first occurrence (`start`), and the index of its last occurrence in `string` (`end - 1`, calculated as the starting index plus the length of `substring` minus one). It is important to note that the function relies on the presence of both parameters being non-empty; if they are empty, this may lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not consider overlapping occurrences of `substring`.**
