The variable `start` is assigned the value of the result from the `find` method applied to `string` with `substring` as the argument. The method returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in the string; otherwise, it returns -1. The previous values of `string` and `substring` are still valid, but we cannot determine the exact value of `start` without specific values for `string` and `substring`.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, or -1 if `substring` is not found in `string`.**
