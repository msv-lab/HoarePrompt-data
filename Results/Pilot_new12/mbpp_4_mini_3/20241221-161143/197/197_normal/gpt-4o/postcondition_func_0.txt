The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and it counts the total occurrences of each element from the list within the tuple. It returns the cumulative count of these occurrences. Notably, if `elements` is empty, the function will return 0 since there are no elements to count. Additionally, if any element in `elements` does not appear in the tuple `tup`, the count for that specific element will contribute 0 to the total. The function effectively handles elements of any type that are present in the tuple.
