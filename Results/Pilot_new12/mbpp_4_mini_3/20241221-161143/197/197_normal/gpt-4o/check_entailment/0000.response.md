Correctness: **False**.

The program counts the occurrences of specified elements in a tuple. However, it uses the `count` method on the tuple to tally occurrences, which means it counts the total occurrences of each element separately. The problem description suggests that the counting should include all specified elements, which implies that if an element appears multiple times, we should account for its count multiple times.

Hereâ€™s a potential case where the program does not work as expected:

For the assertion `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])`, the expected output is 3 because:
- 'a' appears 2 times.
- 'b' appears 1 time.

The `func_1` function returns 3 correctly for this case, but:

For the assertion `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'a', 'b'])` (which is missing in the original code), here the expected output should be 4 because:
- Each 'a' should be counted separately (2) and 'b' once (1), yielding a total of 4.

Since the program doesn't handle duplicate entries in the `elements` list correctly, it could lead to inaccuracies in the counting process. Hence, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all cases.
