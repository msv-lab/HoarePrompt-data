Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of specified elements from a list within a tuple. The summation logic used in `count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))` effectively iterates over each element in `elements`, counts how many times it appears in the `tup`, and accumulates that count.

The output hints indicate that the function returns 0 when the `elements` list is empty, which aligns with the behavior of the code, as there would be no elements to count, resulting in a total count of 0. Furthermore, if any element in `elements` does not exist in the `tup`, the contribution from that element is correctly counted as 0.

Additionally, the provided assertions illustrate that the function behaves as intended for a variety of cases, including characters and integers, ensuring that the function accommodates elements of any type effectively.

Given the reasoning above, the function adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description for every potential case.
