Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to count the occurrences of all elements of a list within a given tuple. 

Here's an explanation of how the function `func_1` meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Types**: The function accepts a tuple (`tup`) and a list (`elements`). The annotations state that the input will be valid and of the specified types, fulfilling the assumptions.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the `elements` list, calling `tup.count(element)` for each. This counts how many times `element` appears in `tup`.

3. **Summation**: The `sum()` function adds up all the counts from the generator expression, resulting in the total number of occurrences of all specified elements from the list within the tuple.

4. **Edge Cases Handled**: 
   - If `elements` is an empty list, the generator expression yields no values, leading `sum()` to return 0, which is the expected behavior.
   - If any of the elements from the list do not appear in the tuple, `tup.count(element)` returns 0 for that element, which is accounted for in the summation.

5. **Tests Provided**: The provided assertions test the function against different input scenarios, confirming its accuracy for both strings and integers.

Thus, the function adheres strictly to the problem description by accurately counting all occurrences of list elements in the tuple and returning the correct total.
