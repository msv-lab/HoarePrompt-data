Correctness: **True**

The program correctly counts the occurrences of all specified elements from a list within a tuple. 

1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and a list as input.
2. It uses a generator expression to iterate through each element in the list (`elements`).
3. For each element, it calls `tup.count(element)` to count how many times that element appears in the tuple.
4. The results from each count are summed up using the `sum` function. 

This means it effectively counts the occurrences of all the elements in the list within the given tuple.

Test cases included demonstrate accurate counting:
- For the tuple `('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd')` and the list `['a', 'b']`, we get 3 (2 for 'a' and 1 for 'b').
- For the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4)` and the list `[1, 4, 7]`, the count is 6 (3 for '1', 2 for '4', and 1 for '7').
- For the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)` and the list `[1, 2]`, the count is 2 (1 for '1' and 1 for '2').

The code handles those cases correctly and will consistently do so for any other valid inputs as per the problem description.
