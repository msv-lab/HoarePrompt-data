The provided Python program is intended to count the occurrences of elements from a list within a tuple. The function is implemented as follows:

```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

The program references are correctly described in the output hints. The function iteratively counts the occurrences of each element from the list `elements` in the tuple `tup`, summing these counts and returning the total. 

The program also handles an edge case where if `elements` is empty, the result will indeed be `0`, as there are no elements to count. Furthermore, if any element in `elements` is not found in `tup`, it contributes a count of `0`, which aligns with the problem description.

From the examples given, the function works as follows:

1. For the first assertion, calling `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])` should yield `3` because 'a' appears `2` times and 'b' appears `1` time in the tuple.
2. For `func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7])`, the function yields `6` (three occurrences of `1`, two of `4`, and one of `7`).
3. Finally, `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2])` returns `2`, counting the occurrences of `1` and `2`.

Given the function adheres strictly to the problem requirements, handles the cases as described in the output hints, and passes all assertions correctly, I conclude the program to be correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly counts the occurrences of all specified elements in the tuple across various scenarios and edge cases, including handling an empty list as input for `elements`.
