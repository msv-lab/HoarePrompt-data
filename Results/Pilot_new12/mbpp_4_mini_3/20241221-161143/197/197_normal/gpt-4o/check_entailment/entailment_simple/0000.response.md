Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the task of counting the occurrences of all elements specified in the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program takes a tuple (`tup`) and a list (`elements`) as inputs, which adheres to the problem's specification.

2. **Counting Logic**:
   - The function utilizes a generator expression to iterate over each element in the input list `elements` and calls `tup.count(element)` to count how many times that element appears in the tuple `tup`.
   - It then sums these counts using the `sum()` function.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns a single integer value that represents the total occurrences of all specified elements from the list within the tuple, which aligns with the requirement to count occurrences.

4. **Testing**:
   - The provided assertions test various cases, and they are structured to check if the function gives the correct total count for different tuples and lists of elements.

Since the program aligns with the problem description and passes the example assertions, it is correct.
