The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elements`. The parameter `tup` is a tuple, and `elements` is a list containing elements that can be of any type. After executing the function body, the program returns the total occurrences of the elements in `elements` within the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and return the count of how many times the elements from the list appear in the tuple. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and returns the total occurrences of the elements in `elements` within the tuple `tup`.**
