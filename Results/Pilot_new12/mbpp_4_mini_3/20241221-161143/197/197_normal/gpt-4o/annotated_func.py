#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and elements is a list of elements that can be of any type.
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
    return count
    #The program returns the total occurrences of the elements in 'elements' within the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and it counts the total occurrences of each element from the list within the tuple. It returns the cumulative count of these occurrences. Notably, if `elements` is empty, the function will return 0 since there are no elements to count. Additionally, if any element in `elements` does not appear in the tuple `tup`, the count for that specific element will contribute 0 to the total. The function effectively handles elements of any type that are present in the tuple.
