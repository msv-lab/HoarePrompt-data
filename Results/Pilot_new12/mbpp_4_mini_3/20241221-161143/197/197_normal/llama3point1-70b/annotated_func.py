#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list containing elements whose occurrences in the tuple are to be counted.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of the occurrences of each element in the list 'lst' within the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and it returns the total count of how many times each element from `lst` appears in `tup`. The function iterates over each element in `lst`, counts its occurrences in `tup` using the `count` method, and sums these counts together. The final output is an integer representing this sum. It is important to note that if an element in `lst` does not appear in `tup`, it contributes zero to the sum, and if both `tup` and `lst` are empty, the return value will also be zero.
