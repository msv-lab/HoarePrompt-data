The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `lst`. `tup` is a tuple, and `lst` is a list containing elements whose occurrences in the tuple are to be counted. After executing the function body, the program returns the sum of the occurrences of each element in the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and return the total count of how many times the elements in `lst` appear in `tup`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, returning the sum of the occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`.**
