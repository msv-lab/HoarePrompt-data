You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze both.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

**Program:** 
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))
```

### Analysis:

1. The program takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input.
2. It iterates over each element in `lst` and counts the occurrences of that element in `tup` using `tup.count(element)`.
3. Finally, it sums these counts and returns the result.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:

- If `lst` contains duplicate elements, the program still counts each occurrence of the duplicates in `tup` separately. Thus, it might return a count that is higher than intuitively expected if one assumes it should count unique occurrences. For example, if `lst` is `[1, 1]` and `tup` is `(1, 2, 3)`, it should ideally return `2` regarding the total occurrences countedâ€”however, it would count `1` two times for its occurrences in `tup`, leading to the correct answer `2` in this scenario. So that part handles duplicates correctly.

- The program will return `0` if `lst` has elements that are not present in `tup`, which is expected according to the problem description.

- If `tup` is empty, the return value will be `0`, which is also correct.

- If `lst` is empty, the return value will be `0`, which is again the correct behavior.

In summary, no problematic cases are identified; the program correctly counts occurrences based on the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as described. 

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list containing elements whose occurrences in the tuple are to be counted.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of the occurrences of each element in the list 'lst' within the tuple 'tup'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
