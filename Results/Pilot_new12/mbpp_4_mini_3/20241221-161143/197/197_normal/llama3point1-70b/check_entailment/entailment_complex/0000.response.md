Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to count the occurrence of each element from a list `lst` in a tuple `tup`. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Types**: The function takes a tuple (`tup`) and a list (`lst`), which aligns with the specification of counting occurrences of elements from a list in a tuple.

2. **Counting Logic**: Within the function, a generator expression iterates over each element in `lst`, counting how many times each element appears in `tup` using the `count` method. This adheres to the requirement of counting occurrences.

3. **Summation**: The program sums these counts, thereby providing a total count of how many times elements from `lst` are found in `tup`. This means even if an element does not exist in the tuple, it correctly contributes zero to the total, as expected.

4. **Handling of Empty Inputs**: As mentioned in the annotations, if both `tup` and `lst` are empty, the function returns zero, which aligns with the expected behavior described.

Overall, since the function correctly implements the logic to satisfy the problem description and handles the specified cases, it is determined to be correct.
