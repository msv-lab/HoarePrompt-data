To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze both.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

**Program:** 
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))
```

### Analysis:

1. The program takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input.
2. It iterates over each element in `lst` and counts the occurrences of that element in `tup` using `tup.count(element)`.
3. Finally, it sums these counts and returns the result.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:

- If `lst` contains duplicate elements, the program still counts each occurrence of the duplicates in `tup` separately. Thus, it might return a count that is higher than intuitively expected if one assumes it should count unique occurrences. For example, if `lst` is `[1, 1]` and `tup` is `(1, 2, 3)`, it should ideally return `2` regarding the total occurrences countedâ€”however, it would count `1` two times for its occurrences in `tup`, leading to the correct answer `2` in this scenario. So that part handles duplicates correctly.

- The program will return `0` if `lst` has elements that are not present in `tup`, which is expected according to the problem description.

- If `tup` is empty, the return value will be `0`, which is also correct.

- If `lst` is empty, the return value will be `0`, which is again the correct behavior.

In summary, no problematic cases are identified; the program correctly counts occurrences based on the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as described. 

Correctness: **True**.
