Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to calculate the total occurrences. Specifically, for each element in the list, it counts how many times that element appears in the tuple using `tup.count(element)`, and then sums these counts.

Here are some points that verify the correctness of the program:

1. **Handles empty inputs:** If either the tuple or the list is empty, the program will return 0, which is the expected output.
2. **Counts distinct and repeated elements:** The function will correctly count occurrences for elements that appear multiple times in the tuple or list.
3. **Handles various data types:** Elements can be of any data type (integers, strings, etc.), and the program will still work correctly.

Since I can't think of a scenario where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, the function behaves as expected for all potential cases.
