Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that counts the occurrences of each element in a list within a tuple, whereas the function `func_1` only returns the total count of occurrences of all elements combined.

To further elaborate:
- The problem specification calls for a count of occurrences of each element of the list in the tuple, implying that the output should provide a count for every individual element from the list.
- However, the function here utilizes `sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)`, which calculates the total count of all elements found in the tuple, rather than counting each element separately.

For example, if the tuple is `(1, 2, 2, 3)` and the list is `[2, 3]`, the expected output should show `{2: 2, 3: 1}`, indicating that `2` occurs twice and `3` occurs once. Instead, this function would return `3` (the total occurrences of elements from the list within the tuple), which is not aligned with the problem description.

Thus, the function does not satisfy the requirements of counting occurrences for each distinct element separately.
