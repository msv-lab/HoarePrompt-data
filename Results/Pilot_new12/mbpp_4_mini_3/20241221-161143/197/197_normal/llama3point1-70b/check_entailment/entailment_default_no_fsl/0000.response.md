Correctness: **True**

The code meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements in the given list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. It achieves this by utilizing the `count` method of tuples, which efficiently counts the occurrences of each element from `lst`. 

The function returns the total count, including cases where some elements in `lst` do not appear in `tup`, contributing zero to the overall count. Furthermore, if both `tup` and `lst` are empty, the function correctly returns zero, as there are no elements to count. Since it handles all potential cases specified in the problem description, the implementation is correct.
