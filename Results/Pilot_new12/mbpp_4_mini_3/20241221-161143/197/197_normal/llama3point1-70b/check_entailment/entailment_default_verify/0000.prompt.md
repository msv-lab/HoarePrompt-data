You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze both.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

**Program:** 
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))
```

### Analysis:

1. The program takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input.
2. It iterates over each element in `lst` and counts the occurrences of that element in `tup` using `tup.count(element)`.
3. Finally, it sums these counts and returns the result.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:

- If `lst` contains duplicate elements, the program still counts each occurrence of the duplicates in `tup` separately. Thus, it might return a count that is higher than intuitively expected if one assumes it should count unique occurrences. For example, if `lst` is `[1, 1]` and `tup` is `(1, 2, 3)`, it should ideally return `2` regarding the total occurrences countedâ€”however, it would count `1` two times for its occurrences in `tup`, leading to the correct answer `2` in this scenario. So that part handles duplicates correctly.

- The program will return `0` if `lst` has elements that are not present in `tup`, which is expected according to the problem description.

- If `tup` is empty, the return value will be `0`, which is also correct.

- If `lst` is empty, the return value will be `0`, which is again the correct behavior.

In summary, no problematic cases are identified; the program correctly counts occurrences based on the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as described. 

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and it returns the total count of how many times each element from `lst` appears in `tup`. The function iterates over each element in `lst`, counts its occurrences in `tup` using the `count` method, and sums these counts together. The final output is an integer representing this sum. It is important to note that if an element in `lst` does not appear in `tup`, it contributes zero to the sum, and if both `tup` and `lst` are empty, the return value will also be zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
