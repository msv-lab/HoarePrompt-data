The provided Python function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each element from a list `lst` within a tuple `tup`. The output hints indicate that the function performs this task by summing up the counts of each element from `lst` found in `tup`. 

Let's analyze the program against the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The program correctly implements the counting of occurrences. 
   - It iterates over each element in `lst` and uses the `count` method of the tuple `tup` to find how many times each element appears.
   - The program then sums these counts and returns the total.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The output hints specify that if an element in `lst` does not appear in `tup`, it contributes zero to the sum, which is correctly handled by the `count` method returning zero for non-existent elements.
   - They also clarify that if both `tup` and `lst` are empty, the function will return zero, which is the expected behavior.

Since the program appears to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and aligns with the output hints, there are no instances where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
