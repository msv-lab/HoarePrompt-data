To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function step by step.

The problem description states:
- Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

The provided program is:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Function**:
   - The program utilizes a list comprehension that iterates over the range from `0` to `n - 1`. For each `i`, it creates a sub-list starting from index `i` and taking every nth element (`lst[i::n]`).
   - This would mean it collects items from the original list starting from index `i` and then picks every `n`th item afterwards.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - For example, if the input list is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `n` is `3`, the expected output is:
     - For `i = 0`: `[0, 3, 6]`
     - For `i = 1`: `[1, 4, 7]`
     - For `i = 2`: `[2, 5]`
   - This results in the output: `[[0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5]]`.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is `0`: This would cause an error (division by zero) because the slicing logic with `lst[i::n]` uses `n` in its stride. This should be handled.
   - If `lst` is empty: `func_1([], n)` should return `[]`, which is handled correctly.
   - If `n` is greater than the length of the list: In that case, the program may not behave as expected. For a list of length 5 and `n = 10`, the result would be `[[0], [1], [2], [], []]`, which may not match user expectations (though technically it returns the output correctly, this may suggest a conceptual issue regarding what "every nth element" means).

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle the case where `n` is `0`, which would result in a runtime error. Therefore, based on the requirement that it must handle every potential case, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**

This conclusion is reached because the function will break with the input `n = 0`, which contradicts the requirement that it works for every potential case.
