Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description accurately. According to the problem description, the function should split the input list into sublists for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. However, the implementation in the function `func_1` incorrectly creates sublists by taking elements starting from each index from `0` to `n-1` and selecting every nth element thereafter.

For example, if the input is `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`, the expected output according to the problem description would be splitting it into two sublists: `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`, but the actual implementation would return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`, which does seem to match the problem. 

However, if `n` is not less than or equal to the length of `lst`, it is outside the original requirements, and in the edge case where `lst` has exactly `n` elements, each sublist should ideally contain only one element corresponding directly to the indices. 

Given that the method of slicing used in the implementation leads to scenarios where it might not accurately fulfill the specifications—in particular, the interpretation that it should be a straightforward split of the list into segments of size `n` rather than creating sublists based on interpolating indices—the program has nuanced misalignment with the requested behavior. 

Therefore, the function does not implement the requirements defined in the problem description.
