Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not align with the problem description. The problem states that the function should split a list into sublists for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. However, the implementation given in the program generates sublists starting from every index `i` in the range of `0` to `n-1`, producing a pattern that takes every nth element from those starting points.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n` is `2`, the expected behavior according to the problem description would be to generate sublists based on every 2nd element. The expected output would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]` (the first sublist starting from index 0 and the second from index 1). However, the given implementation produces `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4], [], []]` when `n` is 2 (when `n` is greater than the size of the list, it results in empty sublists).

Moreover, the implementation assumes `n <= len(lst)`, but it could yield empty sublists for values of `i` when `n` exceeds the length of the input list, which the problem description does not allow.

Therefore, the code does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description.
