You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function step by step.

The problem description states:
- Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

The provided program is:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Function**:
   - The program utilizes a list comprehension that iterates over the range from `0` to `n - 1`. For each `i`, it creates a sub-list starting from index `i` and taking every nth element (`lst[i::n]`).
   - This would mean it collects items from the original list starting from index `i` and then picks every `n`th item afterwards.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - For example, if the input list is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `n` is `3`, the expected output is:
     - For `i = 0`: `[0, 3, 6]`
     - For `i = 1`: `[1, 4, 7]`
     - For `i = 2`: `[2, 5]`
   - This results in the output: `[[0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5]]`.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is `0`: This would cause an error (division by zero) because the slicing logic with `lst[i::n]` uses `n` in its stride. This should be handled.
   - If `lst` is empty: `func_1([], n)` should return `[]`, which is handled correctly.
   - If `n` is greater than the length of the list: In that case, the program may not behave as expected. For a list of length 5 and `n = 10`, the result would be `[[0], [1], [2], [], []]`, which may not match user expectations (though technically it returns the output correctly, this may suggest a conceptual issue regarding what "every nth element" means).

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle the case where `n` is `0`, which would result in a runtime error. Therefore, based on the requirement that it must handle every potential case, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**

This conclusion is reached because the function will break with the input `n = 0`, which contradicts the requirement that it works for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, returning a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist is generated by selecting elements from `lst` starting from index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to n-1), taking every nth element. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will result in empty sublists for the indices beyond the list's length. The outcome is therefore a list of n sublists, with the behavior defined for all cases of `n` such that `n <= len(lst)`, and a valid output is guaranteed when n is positive and correctly constrained. The function does not handle invalid inputs explicitly, such as negative integers or non-integer types for `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
