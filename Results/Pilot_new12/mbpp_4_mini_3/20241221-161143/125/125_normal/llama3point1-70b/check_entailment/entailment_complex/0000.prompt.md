You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n sublists, where each sublist contains elements from 'lst' starting from the ith index and taking every nth element, with i ranging from 0 to n-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, returning a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist is generated by selecting elements from `lst` starting from index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to n-1), taking every nth element. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will result in empty sublists for the indices beyond the list's length. The outcome is therefore a list of n sublists, with the behavior defined for all cases of `n` such that `n <= len(lst)`, and a valid output is guaranteed when n is positive and correctly constrained. The function does not handle invalid inputs explicitly, such as negative integers or non-integer types for `n`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
