Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than the length of the list `lst`, which results in a situation where sublists beyond the length of the list would be empty. While the output hints suggest this behavior, it also states that a valid output is guaranteed when `n` is correctly constrained (i.e., less than or equal to `len(lst)`). 

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `n = 5`, the expected behavior would be to either raise an error or handle it gracefully, but instead, the function would yield `[[], [], [], [], []]`, which is not defined in the problem statement. 

Thus, since the program fails for this potential case, it is not correct as per the requirements laid out in the problem description.
