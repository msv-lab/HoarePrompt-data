The annotated version of the program provides clarity on the expected behavior of the function `func_1`. Based on the annotations, the code is correctly described when it states that when the input to the function is valid (a list and a positive integer), it generates sublists based on the specifications, returning valid outputs. 

The annotations explicitly state that the program handles the case when `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`, and it mentions that if `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the resulting sublists could be empty but would still adhere to the expected behavior of generating `n` sublists. 

Because we are assuming that the input will always be valid (with `n` as a positive integer and `n` not exceeding `len(lst)`), the edge cases discussed in the original assessment related to zero or negative values for `n` are irrelevant in this instance. The program correctly operates within the constraints provided.

Thus, the original assessment indicating potential issues when `n` is `0` or in invalid cases does not apply due to the assumption of valid inputs. The function indeed meets the problem description of creating separate sublists as specified.

Therefore, the original assessment (which concluded the program is incorrect) does not align with the annotations given that we are working under the assumption of valid input.

Final: **True**
