Explanation: The function correctly partitions a list into sublists based on every nth element, starting from different indices ranging from `0` to `n-1`. According to the output hints, the function's behavior is confirmed to be accurate in generating sublists for each starting point. The program utilizes slicing, which effectively captures the elements beyond the limit of the provided list length. When `n` exceeds the length of `lst`, the generated sublists for indices beyond the list's length will be empty, consistent with the expected behavior outlined in the problem description. The hints affirm that the function produces valid outputs for valid inputs as stated. Since it fulfills the requirements for all described cases, I conclude the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
