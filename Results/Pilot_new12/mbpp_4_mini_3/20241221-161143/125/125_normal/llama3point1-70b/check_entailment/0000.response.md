To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the objective of the function based on the problem statement.

### Problem Description
The problem states that we need to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n` and splits the list for every `n`th element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Provided Program
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis
1. **Functionality**: The program uses list comprehension to create sublists starting from each index from `0` to `n-1`, stepping by `n`. This means it creates `n` different sublists by picking every `n`th element starting from each initial index.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - If `lst` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n` is `2`, the expected result is `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`, splitting the list into two parts.
   - If `lst` is an empty list `[]` and `n` is `1`, the expected result is `[[]]`, since there are no elements to split.

3. **Edge Cases and Incorrect Behavior**:
   - If `n` is `0`, the code will throw an `IndexError` because the `range(n)` would be empty and attempting to slice the list in a non-integer context will fail.
   - If `n` is greater than the number of elements in the list, the results could become nonsensical or return empty sublists, which may not align with the intended functionality of separating by `n` elements.
  
### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case where `n` is `0` and can produce unexpected results or errors for lists shorter than `n`. Therefore, there is potential incorrect behavior and it doesn't fulfill the specification for every possible input.

Correctness: **False**.
