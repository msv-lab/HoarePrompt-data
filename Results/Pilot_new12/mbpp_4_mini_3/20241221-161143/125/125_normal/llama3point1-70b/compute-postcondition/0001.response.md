The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. The parameter `lst` is a list of elements, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. The function returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst`, starting from the `i`-th index and taking every `n`th element, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list containing `n` sublists constructed from the elements of `lst` based on the specified indexing logic. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, returning a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements of `lst` starting from each index `i` (0 to n-1) and taking every nth element.**
