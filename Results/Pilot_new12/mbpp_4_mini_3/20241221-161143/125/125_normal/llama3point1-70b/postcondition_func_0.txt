The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, returning a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist is generated by selecting elements from `lst` starting from index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to n-1), taking every nth element. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will result in empty sublists for the indices beyond the list's length. The outcome is therefore a list of n sublists, with the behavior defined for all cases of `n` such that `n <= len(lst)`, and a valid output is guaranteed when n is positive and correctly constrained. The function does not handle invalid inputs explicitly, such as negative integers or non-integer types for `n`.
