#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of n sublists, where each sublist contains elements from 'lst' starting from the ith index and taking every nth element, with i ranging from 0 to n-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, returning a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist is generated by selecting elements from `lst` starting from index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to n-1), taking every nth element. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will result in empty sublists for the indices beyond the list's length. The outcome is therefore a list of n sublists, with the behavior defined for all cases of `n` such that `n <= len(lst)`, and a valid output is guaranteed when n is positive and correctly constrained. The function does not handle invalid inputs explicitly, such as negative integers or non-integer types for `n`.
