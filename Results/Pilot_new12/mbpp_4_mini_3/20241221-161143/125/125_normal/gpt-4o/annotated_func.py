#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` <= len(`lst`), `result` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` distributed among its empty lists in a round-robin manner.
    return result
    #The program returns a list containing the first n elements of lst distributed among its empty lists in a round-robin manner.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It returns a list of `n` empty sublists, where the elements from `lst` are distributed among these sublists in a round-robin manner. The resulting list will contain exactly `n` sublists, but the number of elements in the sublists will depend on the length of `lst`. If `n` is greater than the number of elements in `lst`, the function will still distribute all available elements but will not have enough elements to fill all sublists. Therefore, it effectively distributes all elements of `lst` into the first `n` sublists, ensuring that the process continues until all elements are utilized, with the distribution pattern wrapping around to the first sublist after filling each in sequence. The final state of `result` holds these sublists once the function concludes.
