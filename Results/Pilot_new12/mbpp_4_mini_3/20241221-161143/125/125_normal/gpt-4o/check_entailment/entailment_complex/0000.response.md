Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes in a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and correctly splits the list into sublists based on every nth element. 

Here's a breakdown of why the implementation is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, with the assertion before the function calling it confirming the precondition that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`.

2. **Initialization of Result**: The line `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]` initializes `n` empty lists within the `result`. This is done correctly per the problem description, as it states that the goal is to return a list of resulting lists split every nth element.

3. **Distribution Logic**: The loop `for (i, element) in enumerate(lst)` iterates through each element in the input list. The statement `result[i % n].append(element)` efficiently distributes elements into the sublists in a round-robin manner, which adheres to the requirement of splitting the input list for every nth element.

4. **Final Outcome**: The final return statement `return result` returns the constructed list of sublists, which contains the elements distributed according to the specified logic.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided test various scenarios, confirming that when given a valid list and integer `n`:
   - The function returns the correct distributions for both strings and integers.
   - The distribution pattern correctly matches the expected output, verifying that the implementation properly implements the required functionality.

Overall, given valid inputs, the function will always split the list as needed, ensuring that each sublist receives elements based on their index in a round-robin fashion. Thus, the implementation is correct as per the problem description.
