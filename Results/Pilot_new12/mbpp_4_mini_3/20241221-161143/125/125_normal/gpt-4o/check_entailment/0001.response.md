To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze what the description asks for and what the code does.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a list and an integer `n`, splitting the list such that every nth element fills a separate sublist. It should return a list of these resulting sublists.

### Program Review:
The code provided appears to implement this functionality with the following logic:
1. Create a result list with `n` empty sublists.
2. Iterate over each element in the input list `lst`.
3. For each element, it places the element in the corresponding sublist determined by `i % n`, where `i` is the index of the element in the original list.
4. Finally, it returns the list of sublists.

### Test Cases Provided:
1. The first test checks if the function correctly groups elements by every 3rd index in a character list.
2. The second test does the same with integers.
3. The third test checks with programming language strings.

### Edge Case Considerations:
Here are some edge cases to consider:
1. **Empty List**: If `lst` is empty, `func_1([], 3)` should return `[[], [], []]`.
2. **Single Element**: For `func_1(['a'], 1)`, it should return `[['a']]`.
3. **n Larger than List Length**: For a case like `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'], 5)`, it should return `[['a'], ['b'], ['c'], [], []]`.
4. **n Equal to 0**: This is mathematically undefined in the given context; thus it should ideally handle such a case gracefully or return some indication of an error.
5. **Negative n**: Similarly, a negative integer as `n` may not make sense; thus, handling this is important.

### Result of Testing These Cases:
Upon analyzing these edge cases, the implementation will not handle:
- An empty list properly (it would return the wrong number of nested lists depending on n).
- Cases where `n` is greater than the length of the list will return empty sublists correctly, but it should be confirmed that it always returns `n` sublists.

### Conclusion:
Given that the code does not effectively handle all potential edge cases (specifically the empty list and handling of inappropriate n values properly), we can conclude that the implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False** 

A potential failing case is `func_1([], 3)` which does not return the expected `[[], [], []]`, but rather `[]` or another unexpected format if not handled explicitly. Hence, the function does not meet all requirements stated in the problem description.
