The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where `n` is zero or negative, and does not address the scenario of an empty list correctly. However, the annotated version of the program indicates that it assumes valid input, specifically that `n` is a positive integer and that `lst` is a non-empty list. Therefore, according to the annotations, the function is executed under the assumption that the inputs will always be valid.

Based on the problem description, which only requires the function to work with a valid list and a positive integer `n`, the program does indeed match the requirements by correctly distributing elements from the input list into sublists based on the given integer `n`.

As such, since we are assuming valid inputs and the annotations support the correctness of the program, the original assessment of "False" is not accurate. The program indeed fulfills the requirements set by the problem description.

Final: **True**
