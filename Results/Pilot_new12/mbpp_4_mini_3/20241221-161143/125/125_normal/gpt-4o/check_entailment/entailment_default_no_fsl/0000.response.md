Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(lst, n)` takes a list and a positive integer `n`, and splits the list into `n` sublists by distributing the elements in a round-robin manner. 

The output hints confirm that the function handles cases where `n` is less than, equal to, or greater than the number of elements in `lst`, ensuring all elements are utilized and that the distribution process wraps around correctly. 

The assertions provided in the program serve as tests, demonstrating that the code produces the expected output for the given examples. There are no indications of edge cases that the function fails to handle given the assumption of valid input. Hence, the implementation is consistent with the problem description for every potential case.
