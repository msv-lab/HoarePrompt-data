Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle all necessary edge cases related to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not return the expected output for an empty list (e.g., `func_1([], 3)`). It should return `[[], [], []]` under the assumption that it is valid to request `n` sublists, but it currently does not. Furthermore, the handling of cases where `n` is greater than the length of the list is less problematic, but it still does not guarantee that an empty list will always yield the correct format as per the problem description.

Therefore, while the behavior of the provided test cases does match what the problem description requires, the failure to properly handle edge cases such as an empty list means that the overall correctness is not upheld, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
