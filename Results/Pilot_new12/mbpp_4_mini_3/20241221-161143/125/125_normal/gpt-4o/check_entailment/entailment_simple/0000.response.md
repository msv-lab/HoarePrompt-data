Correctness: **True**

The program provided implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, it defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and correctly splits the list into sublists consisting of every `n`-th element.

Here's the reasoning for its correctness:

1. **Functionality Implementation**: 
   - The program initializes `result` with `n` empty lists. 
   - It iterates through the input list `lst` using `enumerate`, allowing it to access both the index `i` and the corresponding `element`.
   - It then appends each `element` to one of the `n` sublists in a round-robin fashion using the modulus operator `i % n`. This effectively distributes the elements of `lst` into the `n` lists based on their index.

2. **Satisfying Requirements**: 
   - The output of the function matches the expected outcome as per the problem description.
   - For each case in the assertions:
     - For the input `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` with `n = 3`, the output is `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`, which is correct.
     - For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`, the output is `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`, which is also correct.
     - And for `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`, the output is `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`, satisfying the requirement as well.

3. **Invariant Properties**: The state of the program after the for loop ensures that elements are evenly distributed based on their index in a round-robin manner across `n` separate lists without losing any elements.

Thus, the function consistently adheres to the problem description under all valid inputs (as stipulated), leading to the conclusion that the program is correct.
