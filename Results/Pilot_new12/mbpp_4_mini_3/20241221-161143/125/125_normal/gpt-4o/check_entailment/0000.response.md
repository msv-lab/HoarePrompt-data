To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and examine whether it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Description:
The function should take in a list and an integer n and split the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

### Assessing the Program:
1. The function initializes a list `result` with `n` empty sublists.
2. It iterates over the input list `lst` using `enumerate`, appending each element to the corresponding sublist based on the index modulus `n`.
3. The expected behavior is to distribute elements into `n` sublists based on their index in the original list.

### Provided Test Cases:
- For the test case with characters, the expected output is correct.
- For the numerical list case with integers, the expected output is also correct.
- In the case with programming language strings, the expected output matches the requirement.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still work, but it would create more empty sublists than necessary, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the code would attempt to create a list with zero or negative sublists, leading to an issue.
- If `lst` is empty, the output would be a list of empty lists, which may not be consistent with a reasonable expectation of the format of results.

### Conclusion:
Since the function does not handle cases where `n` is zero or negative correctly, or addresses the scenario of an empty list improperly (though arguably it might still return a consistent structure), it could potentially lead to an unexpected output or runtime error.

Correctness: **False**.  
The program fails to account for cases when `n` is less than 1 or when the input list is empty, which means it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.
