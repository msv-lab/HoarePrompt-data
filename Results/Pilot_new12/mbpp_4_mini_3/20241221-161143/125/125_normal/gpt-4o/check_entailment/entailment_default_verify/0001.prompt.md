You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze what the description asks for and what the code does.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a list and an integer `n`, splitting the list such that every nth element fills a separate sublist. It should return a list of these resulting sublists.

### Program Review:
The code provided appears to implement this functionality with the following logic:
1. Create a result list with `n` empty sublists.
2. Iterate over each element in the input list `lst`.
3. For each element, it places the element in the corresponding sublist determined by `i % n`, where `i` is the index of the element in the original list.
4. Finally, it returns the list of sublists.

### Test Cases Provided:
1. The first test checks if the function correctly groups elements by every 3rd index in a character list.
2. The second test does the same with integers.
3. The third test checks with programming language strings.

### Edge Case Considerations:
Here are some edge cases to consider:
1. **Empty List**: If `lst` is empty, `func_1([], 3)` should return `[[], [], []]`.
2. **Single Element**: For `func_1(['a'], 1)`, it should return `[['a']]`.
3. **n Larger than List Length**: For a case like `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'], 5)`, it should return `[['a'], ['b'], ['c'], [], []]`.
4. **n Equal to 0**: This is mathematically undefined in the given context; thus it should ideally handle such a case gracefully or return some indication of an error.
5. **Negative n**: Similarly, a negative integer as `n` may not make sense; thus, handling this is important.

### Result of Testing These Cases:
Upon analyzing these edge cases, the implementation will not handle:
- An empty list properly (it would return the wrong number of nested lists depending on n).
- Cases where `n` is greater than the length of the list will return empty sublists correctly, but it should be confirmed that it always returns `n` sublists.

### Conclusion:
Given that the code does not effectively handle all potential edge cases (specifically the empty list and handling of inappropriate n values properly), we can conclude that the implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False** 

A potential failing case is `func_1([], 3)` which does not return the expected `[[], [], []]`, but rather `[]` or another unexpected format if not handled explicitly. Hence, the function does not meet all requirements stated in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It returns a list of `n` empty sublists, where the elements from `lst` are distributed among these sublists in a round-robin manner. The resulting list will contain exactly `n` sublists, but the number of elements in the sublists will depend on the length of `lst`. If `n` is greater than the number of elements in `lst`, the function will still distribute all available elements but will not have enough elements to fill all sublists. Therefore, it effectively distributes all elements of `lst` into the first `n` sublists, ensuring that the process continues until all elements are utilized, with the distribution pattern wrapping around to the first sublist after filling each in sequence. The final state of `result` holds these sublists once the function concludes.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
