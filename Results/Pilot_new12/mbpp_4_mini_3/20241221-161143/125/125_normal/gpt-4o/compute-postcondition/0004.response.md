`result[i % n]` will refer to one of the sublists within the `result` list based on the value of `i % n`. Since `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to the length of `lst`, `i % n` will be 1 (because 1 modulo any positive integer is 1). The `element` is the second element in `lst`, and its value will be appended to the sublist at `result[1]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements that has at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer and `n` <= len(`lst`), `i` is 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`, `result` is updated to include `element` in `result[1]`.**
