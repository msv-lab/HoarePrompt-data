The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. The parameter `lst` is a list of elements, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, distributed among its empty lists in a round-robin manner. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a new list with the first `n` elements of `lst` arranged in a round-robin fashion among empty lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where n <= len(lst)), returning a list containing the first n elements of lst distributed among its empty lists in a round-robin manner.**
