The code creates a list called `result` containing `n` empty lists. The variable `n` is a positive integer that is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and `result` will contain `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` <= len(`lst`), `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists**
