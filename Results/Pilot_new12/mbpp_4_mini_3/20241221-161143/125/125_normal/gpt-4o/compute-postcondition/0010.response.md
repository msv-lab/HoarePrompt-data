Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`). It returns a list of `n` empty sublists, where the elements from `lst` are distributed among these sublists in a round-robin manner. The resulting list will contain exactly `n` sublists, but the number of elements in the sublists will depend on the length of `lst`. If `n` is greater than the number of elements in `lst`, the function will still distribute all available elements but will not have enough elements to fill all sublists. Therefore, it effectively distributes all elements of `lst` into the first `n` sublists, ensuring that the process continues until all elements are utilized, with the distribution pattern wrapping around to the first sublist after filling each in sequence. The final state of `result` holds these sublists once the function concludes.**
