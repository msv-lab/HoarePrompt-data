According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `lst`. The loop iterates over each element of `lst`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `n` <= len(`lst`), for the loop to execute, it is sufficient that `lst` contains at least one element, which it does since `n` is positive. After the last iteration of the loop, `i` would be equal to the length of `lst` minus 1 and `element` would be the last element of `lst`.

To summarize for the loop execution:
- `lst` must have at least one element.
- `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration until it reaches len(`lst`) - 1.
- The `element` will correspond to the respective item in `lst` for each iteration.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer and `n` <= len(`lst`), `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`**
