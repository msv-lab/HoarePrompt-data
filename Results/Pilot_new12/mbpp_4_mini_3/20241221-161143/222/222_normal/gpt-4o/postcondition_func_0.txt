The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string consisting solely of the uppercase characters extracted from `s`. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, it will return an empty string. The function does not handle or check for potential edge cases such as the input being `None` or other data types; it assumes that the input is always a string. The function inherently filters out any lowercase letters and does not affect them in any other way.
