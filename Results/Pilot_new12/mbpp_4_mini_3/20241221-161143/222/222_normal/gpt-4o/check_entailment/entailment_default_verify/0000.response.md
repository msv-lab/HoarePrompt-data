The program `func_1` is designed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, which aligns with the problem description. The core functionality of the program is confirmed by the output hints, which state that the function accepts a string and returns a new string consisting solely of uppercase characters, effectively removing any lowercase characters.

The provided assertions ('PYTHon', 'FInD', 'STRinG') validate that the function correctly returns the expected results for these inputs. Additionally, the output hints clarify that the function returns an empty string when no uppercase characters are present, which is consistent with the expectation of filtering lowercase substrings.

The original assessment stated that the correctness of the program is **True** and, based on the output hints, this assessment appears valid. The assertion that the program inherently filters out lowercase letters without improper handling of potential edge cases (such as when the input is `None` or of different data types) is aligned with the assumption that valid string inputs will always be provided.

Given all of this information, I find that the program does conform to the problem requirements, as outlined in the original assessment.

Final: **True**
