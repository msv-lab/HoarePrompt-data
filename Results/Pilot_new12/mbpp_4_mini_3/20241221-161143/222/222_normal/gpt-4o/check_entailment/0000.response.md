Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string `s` by checking each character and retaining only those that are uppercase. The assertions provided confirm that it works properly for various test cases, specifically for the strings 'PYTHon', 'FInD', and 'STRinG'. The logic ensures that any lowercase character is excluded, resulting in the expected output. Since no edge cases or other examples contravene the functionality, the program meets the problem description's requirements across all tested scenarios.
