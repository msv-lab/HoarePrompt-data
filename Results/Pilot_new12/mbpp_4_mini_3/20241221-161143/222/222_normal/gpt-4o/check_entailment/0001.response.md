Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description, which states "to remove lowercase substrings from a given string." While the program filters out lowercase characters effectively, it retains only uppercase characters. 

For example, consider the input:

```python
assert func_1('abcDEF') == 'DEF'  # Expected output
```

In this case, the function returns 'DEF', which is correct. However, the function does not handle the removal of lowercase substrings that may appear in consecutive sequences properlyâ€”for example:

```python
assert func_1('aBcDeFg') == 'BDF'  # Expected output
```

The expected output based on the problem statement would be 'BCDF', as all lowercase substrings ('a', 'e', 'g') should be removed entirely, not just the individual lowercase letters.

Thus, since the code fails to meet the requirement for input cases that involve mixed lower and uppercase letters, the function does not behave as expected in every potential case. Therefore, the conclusion is that the correctness is **False**.
