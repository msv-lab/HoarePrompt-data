Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate as the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. While the function `func_1` does effectively filter out lowercase characters from the input string, it does not properly implement the requirement to "remove lowercase substrings." The distinction is crucial; if multiple lowercase letters appear contiguously, the problem description suggests removing them entirely, which is not achieved by the current implementation.

For example, as pointed out in the original assessment, the input 'aBcDeFg' is expected to yield 'BCDF', as the lowercase substrings (lowercase letters) should be removed entirely. The program instead produces 'BDF' by discarding individual lowercase characters, which does not align with the intent of the problem description.

Furthermore, the output hints confirm the function's focus on extracting uppercase characters without addressing any requirement for handling lowercase substrings as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the assessment that the program's correctness is **False** remains justified.
