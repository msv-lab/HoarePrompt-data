Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program's intent is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it only retains uppercase characters. The important distinction here is that the problem description aims for the removal of all lowercase letters in a way that is not limited to just ignoring them individually. The annotations indicate that the function solely checks for uppercase characters while disregarding the complete removal requirement of lowercase substrings. For mixed strings with lowercase letters, the program fails to satisfy the expectation of retaining the correct uppercase order as well as ensuring that any lowercase letters do not disrupt the intended character preservation. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description in its entirety, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is indeed **False**.
