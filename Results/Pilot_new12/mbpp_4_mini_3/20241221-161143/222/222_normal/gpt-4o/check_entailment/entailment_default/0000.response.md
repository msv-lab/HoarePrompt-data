The program is designed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string by returning a new string consisting solely of uppercase characters. It uses list comprehension to filter out any lowercase letters and retains only the uppercase letters.

The provided output hints indicate that the function `func_1` successfully filters out lowercase letters and returns an empty string if no uppercase letters are found. However, the hints also indicate potential issues regarding edge cases, such as the function not handling inputs that are not strings or being `None`. 

Since the problem description specifies a function to remove "lowercase substrings," one might interpret "substrings" as potentially implying sections of consecutive lowercase letters; however, the actual implementation simply removes any lowercase characters without considering substring logic.

While the outputs shown (like `'PYTHon'` yielding `'PYTH'`) confirm that the function works for valid string inputs, the lack of handling for non-string inputs or edge cases could lead to faulty behavior under certain conditions.

1. Function behavior with a string without uppercase letters (e.g., `'python'` should return `''`).
2. If given `None` or an integer, it could raise an error rather than return an empty string or handle it gracefully.

The code fails to account for these types of edge cases comprehensively within the description. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of handling all potential cases, which leads us to conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
