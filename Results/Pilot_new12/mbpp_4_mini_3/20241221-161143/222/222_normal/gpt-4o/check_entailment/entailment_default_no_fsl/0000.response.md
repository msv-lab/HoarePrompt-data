Correctness: **False**

The program's intent is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, leaving only uppercase characters. However, the problem description does not specify whether to handle inputs that do not conform to the expected string type, nor does it consider the behavior when the input string has no uppercase characters or contains only lowercase letters.

While the provided assertions seem to align with the expected behavior for strings that contain uppercase characters, the function does not address potential edge cases such as:
1. Input strings without uppercase letters (e.g., the input "hello" should return an empty string which is correct, but it should be confirmed).
2. Input strings with various characters including punctuation or numbers and their handling is not specified.
3. The assumption that the input will always be a valid string. If a user passes `None` or a non-string data type, the function would raise an error.

Given these considerations, since the program does not ensure correctness for every potential case and does not handle inputs like `None` or other data types appropriately, it cannot be deemed correct.
