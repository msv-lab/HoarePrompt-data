Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function should "remove lowercase substrings from a given string". However, the program as written only filters out lowercase characters and keeps uppercase characters. 

While the result might appear similar to "removing" substrings if the entire lowercase letter is considered as a substring, the requirement to handle lowercase substrings (which implies potentially multi-character sequences of lowercase letters) is not satisfied, as the program does not consider how consecutive lowercase letters might form substrings. 

For example, the string "abcDEfG" would result in "DEG" according to the current implementation, but if we correctly interpreted "substrings" as groups of consecutive letters, we would be expected to remove "abc" and "f" entirely, leading to "DEG" being the correct output. However, the program does not address cases involving consecutive lowercase characters and treats each character independently.

Thus, the implementation does not follow the described task accurately in terms of removing lowercase substrings.
