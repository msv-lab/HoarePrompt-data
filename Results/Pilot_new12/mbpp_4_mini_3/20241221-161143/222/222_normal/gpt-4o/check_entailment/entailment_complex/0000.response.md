Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The specification requires that the function should "remove lowercase substrings from a given string." However, the current implementation, `func_1`, only retains uppercase characters and does not specifically remove entire lowercase substrings.

For example, in the case of the input string 'PYTHon', the expected output based on the problem description should be something that removes the lowercase substring 'on', resulting in 'PYTH', which it technically provides as output but fails to meet the requirement of handling lowercase substrings effectively. The program logic relies on retaining the uppercase characters rather than specifically targeting and removing sequences of lowercase letters.

Thus, there are inputs that could serve as counterexamples. If given 'abcde', the expected behavior according to the problem description would be to return '' (empty string), which the implementation would also provide. However, the key issue lies in the interpretation of what constitutes a "lowercase substring." The use of the word "substring" implies sequences of lowercase characters should be removed fully, not just filtered out based on cases.

Hence, while the output may appear to align with expected results momentarily, it does not meet the operations described in the problem, making it incorrect in its broader intent.
