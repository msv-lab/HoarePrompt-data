#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that may contain lowercase substrings.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
    #The program returns an empty string because the original string 's' may only contain lowercase substrings, thus there are no uppercase characters to join.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string consisting solely of the uppercase characters extracted from `s`. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, it will return an empty string. The function does not handle or check for potential edge cases such as the input being `None` or other data types; it assumes that the input is always a string. The function inherently filters out any lowercase letters and does not affect them in any other way.
