The program provided is intended to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but instead, it only extracts uppercase characters. 

The key point from the problem description is to "remove lowercase substrings," which implies that the function should either remove all lowercase letters from the string or provide an updated string that contains only the characters that are not lowercase letters (including both uppercase and non-letter characters). 

The output hints clarify that the function `func_1` exclusively captures uppercase letters and completely ignores lowercase letters. This goes against the problem requirement since it does not correctly remove lowercase characters, but only filters and retains uppercase characters. Thus, while it might properly remove lowercase letters in a limited sense (by not including them in the output), it doesn't achieve the intended task of removing them from substrings.

A specific case where the program does not fulfill the requirement is:
- Input: "Hello World!" 
  - Expected Output (if correctly removing lowercase): "H W!"
  - Actual Output: "HW"

This demonstrates a discrepancy wherein the program does not remove lowercase substrings in the intended manner nor does it handle the entire string as stipulated.

Correctness: **False**.
