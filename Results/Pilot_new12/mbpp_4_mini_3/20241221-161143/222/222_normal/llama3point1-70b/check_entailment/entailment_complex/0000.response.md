Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. The task specifies that the function must remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the function `func_1` only extracts and returns uppercase letters from the input string `s`. 

As a result, instead of removing lowercase substrings, the function retains only the uppercase characters and ignores the lowercase characters entirely, which is the opposite of what is required. Thus, the implementation fails to fulfill the original request of removing lowercase substrings, making it incorrect.
