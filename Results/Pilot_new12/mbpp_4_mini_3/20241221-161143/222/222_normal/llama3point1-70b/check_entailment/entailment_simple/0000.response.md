Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description requests a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the program as written only extracts and returns uppercase letters from the input string, effectively ignoring lowercase letters entirely rather than removing them. 

For example, given the input string "HelloWorld", the expected behavior would involve removing the lowercase letters and returning "HW". However, the function will return "HW" but does not fulfill the requirement of "removing lowercase substrings" since it does not produce a string with lowercase letters removed entirely; it just collects uppercase letters.

Consequently, the program fails to perform the intended operation as specified, leading to the conclusion that it does not satisfy the problem's requirement.
