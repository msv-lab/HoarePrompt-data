You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program only retains uppercase characters and ignores all lowercase characters. 

For example, consider the input string `"HelloWorld"`. The expected output, according to the problem description, would be `"HW"` since the lowercase letters (`"ello"` and `"orld"`) should be removed. However, the actual output of the program would also be `"HW"`, which is correct in this specific case.

However, when the input string contains only lowercase letters, e.g., `"abcdef"`, the expected output should be an empty string `""` because all lowercase substrings have been removed. The program, however, incorrectly returns an empty string in this case too. 

The logic of the function does not technically match the problem requirements because it does not consider entire substrings of lowercase characters (i.e., multiple consecutive lowercase letters), as it simply checks each character individually. Thus, if given mixed cases, it will not effectively remove substrings as intended.

Going back to another example, an input of `"Hello there!"` is expected to output `"H"` and leave out lowercase "ello there". However, it only looks for uppercase characters, thus failing to meet the full problem requirement of removing lowercase substrings. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality across the board and could lead to incorrect results in edge cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that may contain lowercase substrings.
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `result` is a string containing all uppercase letters found in `s`. If `s` has no uppercase letters, `result` remains an empty string.
    return result
    #The program returns the string containing all uppercase letters found in 's', or an empty string if 's' has no uppercase letters.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
