The program in question is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, which fundamentally requires eliminating all lowercase characters from the string. However, upon analyzing the provided implementation, we see that the function `func_1` only appends uppercase characters to the result string, completely ignoring the requirement to remove lowercase substrings. 

The original assessment correctly states that the program does not achieve the intended functionality, as illustrated by the specific case of input "abcDefg" where the expected output is "D", but the actual output would be an empty string because there are no uppercase characters before any lowercase ones in this particular iteration. Furthermore, the annotations indicate that after the for loop, the `result` only contains the uppercase letters found in `s`, which does not align with the need to remove lowercase characters rather than just collecting uppercase ones.

Thus, the original assessment of correctness being **False** stands accurate since the program fails to meet the problem description's requirements.

Final: **False**
