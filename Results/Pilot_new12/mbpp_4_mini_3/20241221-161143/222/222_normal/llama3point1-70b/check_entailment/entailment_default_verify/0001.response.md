Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fulfill the requirement of removing lowercase substrings from a given string, as outlined in the problem description. Instead, it only retains uppercase letters, which does not constitute the correct functionality according to the requirements. 

The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` only extracts uppercase letters from the input string, failing to address the appropriate task of removing entire substrings of lowercase letters. The program, therefore, does not satisfy the key aspect of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed incorrect.
