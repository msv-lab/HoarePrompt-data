Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program only retains uppercase characters and ignores all lowercase characters. 

For example, consider the input string `"HelloWorld"`. The expected output, according to the problem description, would be `"HW"` since the lowercase letters (`"ello"` and `"orld"`) should be removed. However, the actual output of the program would also be `"HW"`, which is correct in this specific case.

However, when the input string contains only lowercase letters, e.g., `"abcdef"`, the expected output should be an empty string `""` because all lowercase substrings have been removed. The program, however, incorrectly returns an empty string in this case too. 

The logic of the function does not technically match the problem requirements because it does not consider entire substrings of lowercase characters (i.e., multiple consecutive lowercase letters), as it simply checks each character individually. Thus, if given mixed cases, it will not effectively remove substrings as intended.

Going back to another example, an input of `"Hello there!"` is expected to output `"H"` and leave out lowercase "ello there". However, it only looks for uppercase characters, thus failing to meet the full problem requirement of removing lowercase substrings. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality across the board and could lead to incorrect results in edge cases.
