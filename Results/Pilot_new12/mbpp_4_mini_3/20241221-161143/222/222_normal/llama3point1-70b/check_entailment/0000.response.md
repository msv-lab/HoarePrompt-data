Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the problem description, as it only appends uppercase characters to the result string and fails to remove lowercase substrings. For instance, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program outputs "HW", which does not meet the requirement of removing lowercase substrings. A correct implementation should return "H W" (retaining spaces or removing lowercase characters) but instead does not remove any substrings, which leads to an incorrect output. 

Here's a specific case:
- Input: "abcDefg"
- Expected Output: "D"
- Actual Output: "" 

Thus, the program does not achieve the intended functionality of removing all lowercase substrings properly.
