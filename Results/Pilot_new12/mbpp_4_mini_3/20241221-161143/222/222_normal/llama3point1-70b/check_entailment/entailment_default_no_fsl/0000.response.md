Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it only retains uppercase letters and ignores everything else, including lowercase characters and non-letter characters. This does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

For example, the input string "abcDEf" should return "DE" as the lowercase letters "abc" and "f" are removed. However, the current implementation only returns uppercase letters, producing "DE" but not actually removing the substrings as required by the problem statement.

Additionally, the output hints correctly mention that the function `func_1` "extracts all uppercase letters," clarifying that it does not actually remove lowercase substrings as required. Thus, the program's logic doesn't match the given problem description.
