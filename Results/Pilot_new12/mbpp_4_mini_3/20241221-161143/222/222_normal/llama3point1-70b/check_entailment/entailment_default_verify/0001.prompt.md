You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program only retains uppercase characters and ignores all lowercase characters. 

For example, consider the input string `"HelloWorld"`. The expected output, according to the problem description, would be `"HW"` since the lowercase letters (`"ello"` and `"orld"`) should be removed. However, the actual output of the program would also be `"HW"`, which is correct in this specific case.

However, when the input string contains only lowercase letters, e.g., `"abcdef"`, the expected output should be an empty string `""` because all lowercase substrings have been removed. The program, however, incorrectly returns an empty string in this case too. 

The logic of the function does not technically match the problem requirements because it does not consider entire substrings of lowercase characters (i.e., multiple consecutive lowercase letters), as it simply checks each character individually. Thus, if given mixed cases, it will not effectively remove substrings as intended.

Going back to another example, an input of `"Hello there!"` is expected to output `"H"` and leave out lowercase "ello there". However, it only looks for uppercase characters, thus failing to meet the full problem requirement of removing lowercase substrings. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality across the board and could lead to incorrect results in edge cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and extracts all uppercase letters from it. It constructs a new string, `result`, that contains only these uppercase letters. If there are no uppercase letters in `s`, the `result` will be an empty string. The function effectively filters the input string for uppercase characters and returns the filtered string, ensuring to handle cases where `s` may consist entirely of lowercase letters or be empty. It does not account for non-letter characters; if any uppercase letters exist alongside such characters, only the uppercase letters are retained in the output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
