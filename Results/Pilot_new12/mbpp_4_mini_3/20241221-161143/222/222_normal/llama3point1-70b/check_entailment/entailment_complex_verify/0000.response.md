The problem description clearly states that the goal is to write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. This means that all lowercase letters should be removed from the input string, resulting in a string that contains only non-lowercase characters (including uppercase letters and potentially other characters).

However, examining the provided program `func_1`, it is evident that the function does not correctly fulfill this requirement. The function is designed to accumulate only the uppercase letters from the input string and ignores lowercase letters, thereby not achieving the removal of lowercase substrings; instead, it only retains uppercase letters.

The original assessment labeled the program's correctness as **False**, which accurately reflects that the program does not meet the requirement of removing lowercase characters. The annotations corroborate this by clarifying that the result string only contains uppercase letters found in the input string. Importantly, it highlights that if there are no uppercase letters, the result will indeed be an empty string, which further indicates that lowercase characters are not being removed as required but are simply omitted during processing.

Based on this analysis, I find no compelling reason to change the original assessment. The program does not achieve the goal of removing lowercase substrings as specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
