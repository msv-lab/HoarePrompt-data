You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that may contain lowercase substrings.
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `result` is a string containing all uppercase letters found in `s`. If `s` has no uppercase letters, `result` remains an empty string.
    return result
    #The program returns the string containing all uppercase letters found in 's', or an empty string if 's' has no uppercase letters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and extracts all uppercase letters from it. It constructs a new string, `result`, that contains only these uppercase letters. If there are no uppercase letters in `s`, the `result` will be an empty string. The function effectively filters the input string for uppercase characters and returns the filtered string, ensuring to handle cases where `s` may consist entirely of lowercase letters or be empty. It does not account for non-letter characters; if any uppercase letters exist alongside such characters, only the uppercase letters are retained in the output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
