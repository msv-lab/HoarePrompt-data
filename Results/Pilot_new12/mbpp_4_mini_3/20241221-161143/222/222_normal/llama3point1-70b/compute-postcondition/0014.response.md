Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and extracts all uppercase letters from it. It constructs a new string, `result`, that contains only these uppercase letters. If there are no uppercase letters in `s`, the `result` will be an empty string. The function effectively filters the input string for uppercase characters and returns the filtered string, ensuring to handle cases where `s` may consist entirely of lowercase letters or be empty. It does not account for non-letter characters; if any uppercase letters exist alongside such characters, only the uppercase letters are retained in the output.**
