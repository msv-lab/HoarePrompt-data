`result` is assigned the value of `result` plus `char`, where `result` is initially an empty string and `char` is the first character of `s`, which is specified to be an uppercase letter. After execution, `result` will hold the value of `char`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `result` is an upper case letter `char`, and `char` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `result` is an upper case letter `char`, `char` is the first character of `s`**
