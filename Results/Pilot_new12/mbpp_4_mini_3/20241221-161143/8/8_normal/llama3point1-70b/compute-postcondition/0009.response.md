The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character. 

In terms of its return value:
- Case 1: If there is a single occurrence of `char` in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with that occurrence replaced by an empty string, effectively removing `char` from `s`.
- Case 2: If there are at least two occurrences of `char` in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with both the first and last occurrences of `char` removed.
- Case 3: If `char` is not found in `s`, the function returns `s` unchanged, indicating that `char` is absent in the string.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `char`, removing occurrences of `char` from `s` based on how many times `char` appears, and handling cases where `char` is absent without altering `s`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`, returning `s` with the single occurrence of `char` removed, the first and last occurrences of `char` removed if there are at least two occurrences, or `s` unchanged if `char` is not present.**
