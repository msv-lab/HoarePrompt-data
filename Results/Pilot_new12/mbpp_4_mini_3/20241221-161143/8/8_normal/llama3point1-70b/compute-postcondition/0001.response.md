The value of `last_occurrence` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is found within `s`, `last_occurrence` will be a non-negative integer representing that index; if `char` is not found, it will be -1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` or -1 if not found.**
