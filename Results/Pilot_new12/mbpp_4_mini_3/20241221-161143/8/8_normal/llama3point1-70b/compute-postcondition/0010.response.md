Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`. It performs the following actions based on the occurrences of `char` in `s`: 

1. If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, it returns the string `s` with that single occurrence of `char` removed.
2. If `char` appears two or more times in `s`, it returns the string `s` with both the first and the last occurrences of `char` removed.
3. If `char` is not present in `s`, it returns the original string `s` unchanged.

The function effectively modifies the input string `s` based on the count of the specified character `char`, handling cases where `char` may be absent or present multiple times.**
