`first_occurrence` is assigned the value of the position of the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is not found in `s`, `first_occurrence` will be -1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `char` is a single character, and `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` or -1 if `char` is not present in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` or -1 if not found.**
