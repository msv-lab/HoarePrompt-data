After thoroughly analyzing the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment, and the output hints, it is clear that the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

The function correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string, as indicated in the output hints. The function handles various cases effectively:
1. When the character appears exactly once, it removes that character appropriately.
2. When the character appears multiple times, it successfully removes both the first and last occurrences.
3. If the character is not present in the string, it returns the string unchanged.

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program because it appropriately covers the analysis and testing of various edge cases. Additionally, the output hints align with the functionality of the program, reinforcing the conclusion drawn by the original assessment.

Thus, the conclusion regarding the correctness of the program remains valid. 

Final: **True**
