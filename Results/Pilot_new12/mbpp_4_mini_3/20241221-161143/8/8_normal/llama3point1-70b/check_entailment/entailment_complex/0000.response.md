Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a single character `char`. This aligns with the problem specification.

2. The program uses `s.find(char)` to get the index of the first occurrence of `char`, and `s.rfind(char)` to get the index of the last occurrence. This is crucial for the functionality as it allows the program to determine whether to remove these occurrences.

3. The program checks if both occurrences are found (`first_occurrence != -1` and `last_occurrence != -1`):
   - If `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, it indicates that `char` appears only once in `s`. The program correctly handles this case by using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, which removes that single occurrence, exactly as described.
   - If `first_occurrence` does not equal `last_occurrence`, this means `char` appears more than once. The program accurately constructs a new string that skips over the characters at the indices of the first and last occurrences of `char`, effectively removing both.

4. Lastly, if `char` is not found in `s`, the program returns the original string `s` unchanged, which complies with the requirement of returning the string as is when the character does not exist in it.

In all potential scenarios (single occurrence, multiple occurrences, or no occurrences), the function behaves as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is indeed correct.
