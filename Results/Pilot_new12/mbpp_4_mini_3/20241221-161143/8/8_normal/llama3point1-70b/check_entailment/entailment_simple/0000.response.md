The program provided correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. Let's analyze the program step by step to ensure that it meets the requirements:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The program uses `s.find(char)` to find the index of the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(char)` to find the index of the last occurrence of the character `char`.

2. **Handling Cases**:
   - If both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not -1, it means that the character occurs at least once in the string.
   - If `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, then the character appears only once in the string, and the program correctly removes it using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This replaces the first occurrence but since it's the same as the last occurrence, effectively it removes the single occurrence of `char`.

3. **Removing Both Occurrences**:
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, the program constructs the resulting string by concatenating:
     - The substring before the first occurrence (`s[:first_occurrence]`)
     - The substring between the first and last occurrences, excluding both (`s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]`)
     - The substring after the last occurrence (`s[last_occurrence + 1:]`)
   This process correctly removes both the first and last occurrences of `char`.

4. **No Occurrences**:
   - If `char` is not present in `s` (i.e., both occurrences are -1), the program correctly returns `s` unchanged, adhering to the specification.

In all scenarios described (when the character appears once, multiple times, or not at all), the function performs precisely as outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, since the program consistently removes the first and last occurrences of the given character as required, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
