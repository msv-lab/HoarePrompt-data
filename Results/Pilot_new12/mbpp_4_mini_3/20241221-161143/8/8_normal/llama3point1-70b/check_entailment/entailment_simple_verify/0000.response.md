The original assessment accurately analyzes the function `func_1` in the context of the problem description, which is to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. The step-by-step examination shows that the program correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the specified character and handles scenarios where there is only one occurrence or multiple occurrences appropriately. Additionally, it returns the original string when the character is not found, as required.

The annotated version complements the original assessment by providing clarity on the program's behavior at critical points, confirming that the program's logic aligns with the expected outcomes for various test cases.

Based on both the original assessment and the annotated code, the program meets the specified problem requirements. Therefore, the conclusion remains consistent with prior evaluations.

Final: **True**
