To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to consider all potential edge cases for the function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Review of the Program:
```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
    - The program uses `str.find(char)` to get the index of the first occurrence and `str.rfind(char)` to get the index of the last occurrence.
  
2. **Handling Different Cases**:
    - If both occurrences are found and they are the same (the character appears only once), it replaces the first occurrence by using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
    - If more than one occurrence exists, it constructs a new string excluding both the first and last occurrences by slicing.

3. **Issues in Logic**:
    - The program does not handle the case where the character is present at the start or end of the string correctly if there are no other occurrences of that character. For example, for the input `("abcda", "a")`, the output should be `("bcd")`, but it returns `("bcd")` which is correct. However, the potential edge case arises when the character is a space: `("  ab  c ", " ")`, which should return `("ab c")` but becomes `("ab  c ")`, still returning incorrect results by keeping an extra space.
    - Additionally, an empty string as input, like `("", "a")`, returns an empty string as expected, but the problem description does not clarify the desired result for the case where there are no occurrences.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw in how it handles spaces and edge cases surrounding the removal of the character, specifically leaving one occurrence behind or mismanaging string slicing in specific configurations. Thus, it does not universally satisfy the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Example of failure**: For the input `("  ab  c ", " ")`, the program incorrectly retains an extra space, thus not removing the first and last occurrences correctly as intended.
