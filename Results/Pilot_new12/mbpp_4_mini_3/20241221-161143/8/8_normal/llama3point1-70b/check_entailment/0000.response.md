To determine the correctness of the provided program, let’s analyze it in the context of the problem description, which requires removing the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

### Detailed Examination:
1. **Finding occurrences**:
   - `first_occurrence` retrieves the index of the first occurrence of `char`.
   - `last_occurrence` retrieves the index of the last occurrence of `char`.
2. **Condition for both occurrences**:
   - If both occurrences are found (`first_occurrence != -1` and `last_occurrence != -1`), the logic branches are handled:
     - If both indices are the same (meaning there is only one occurrence), it replaces the character with an empty string using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, which correctly removes that character.
     - If both indices differ, it constructs a new string by:
       - Taking the substring from the start to just before the first occurrence,
       - Skipping the character at the `first_occurrence`,
       - Taking the substring from just after the `first_occurrence` to just before the `last_occurrence`,
       - Finally, appending the substring from after `last_occurrence`.

3. **Return the original string**:
   - If the character is not found at all, it simply returns the original string `s`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
To verify the correctness, let’s consider different test cases:
- **Case 1**: 
  - Input: `func_1("hello", "l")`
  - Expected Output: `"he"`
  - Behavior: Correctly removes first and last occurrences of `l`.

- **Case 2**:
  - Input: `func_1("hello", "o")`
  - Expected Output: `"hell"`
  - Behavior: Correctly removes first and last occurrences of `o`.

- **Case 3**:
  - Input: `func_1("hello", "h")`
  - Expected Output: `"ello"`
  - Behavior: Correctly removes first occurrence of `h`.

- **Case 4**:
  - Input: `func_1("aabbcc", "b")`
  - Expected Output: `"aacc"`
  - Behavior: Correctly removes first occurrence of `b` and last occurrence of `b`.

- **Case 5**:
  - Input: `func_1("abcd", "e")`
  - Expected Output: `"abcd"`
  - Behavior: Correctly returns the string unchanged since `e` is absent.

### Conclusions:
Through analysis and testing, the program correctly addresses all potential cases required by the problem description. The handling of edge cases (like a character not being present) works as intended.

Correctness: **True**.
