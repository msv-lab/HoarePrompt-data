Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the string `s` contains only one character that matches `char` correctly. According to the problem description, if `char` appears exactly once in `s`, that occurrence should be removed. However, the logic within the program will only reach the branch to remove the character if it checks that both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not equal, leading to incorrect behavior. 

For example, if `s` is `"a"` and `char` is `"a"`, the expected output should be an empty string `""`, but the program will return `" "` (the original input) due to the conditions set.

Additionally, if `s` is an empty string `""` and `char` is any character, the function also returns `""`, which is the expected behavior, but the function does not explicitly address this case in the structure of the code, making it less robust.

Thus, the function fails to correctly remove characters in every potential case as outlined in the problem description.
