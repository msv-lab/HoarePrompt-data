To conclude the correctness of the program based on the annotated version and the original assessment, we follow these guidelines:

### Review of Original Assessment:
The original assessment pointed out edge cases in how the function handles strings and correctly identified that the program does not universally satisfy the problem's requirement. Specifically, it highlighted problems with handling spaces and conditions in which the character does not behave as expected.

### Review of Annotated Code:
The annotations confirm the functionality laid out in the original assessment:
1. The program correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of the given character.
2. It explicitly addresses cases where the character appears exactly once or multiple times.
3. It correctly retains the original string when the character is not found.

However, both the original assessment and the annotated comments emphasized a crucial problem: the handling of edge cases, particularly with spaces. For instance, the input `("  ab  c ", " ")` leads to the improper retention of an additional space despite the character being identified and correctly located.

### Final Assessment:
Given that:
- The program fails to handle specific edge cases related to spaces correctly, as noted in both the original assessment and further confirmed by the annotations.
- The overall intention and the core operational logic of the program mostly align with the problem description, but the mismanagement of those edge cases undermines its correctness.

We conclude with the original assessment's reasoning that indicates the program is flawed. Thus, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **False**
