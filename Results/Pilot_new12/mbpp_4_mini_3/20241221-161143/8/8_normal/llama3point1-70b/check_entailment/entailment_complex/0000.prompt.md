You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string, and char is a single character.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string 's' with the single occurrence of 'char' replaced by an empty string, resulting in `s` without `char`.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` and the last occurrence of `char` removed, where `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char`, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char`.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns the string `s`, which may or may not contain the character `char`, and where `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are -1, indicating that `char` is not present in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`. It performs the following actions based on the occurrences of `char` in `s`: 

1. If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, it returns the string `s` with that single occurrence of `char` removed.
2. If `char` appears two or more times in `s`, it returns the string `s` with both the first and the last occurrences of `char` removed.
3. If `char` is not present in `s`, it returns the original string `s` unchanged.

The function effectively modifies the input string `s` based on the count of the specified character `char`, handling cases where `char` may be absent or present multiple times.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
