The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch`. It checks for the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` does not appear at least twice in `s`, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged. If `ch` appears twice or more, the function returns a new string that removes the first and last occurrences of `ch`, along with anything between these two occurrences. Edge cases to consider include when `ch` is not present in `s`, when `ch` appears only once, and when `s` is empty. The function does not modify the original string and does not perform any error checking for non-string inputs or multiple-character strings for the variable `ch`.
