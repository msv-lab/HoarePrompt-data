#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's' regardless of the values of 'ch', 'first_index', and 'last_index'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, which is not -1; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, which is not -1; and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns a new string formed by removing the first and last occurrence of character `ch` from the string `s`. The part of the string before `first_index` is kept, the segment between `first_index` and `last_index` is removed (excluding both), and the part after `last_index` is appended.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch`. It checks for the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` does not appear at least twice in `s`, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged. If `ch` appears twice or more, the function returns a new string that removes the first and last occurrences of `ch`, along with anything between these two occurrences. Edge cases to consider include when `ch` is not present in `s`, when `ch` appears only once, and when `s` is empty. The function does not modify the original string and does not perform any error checking for non-string inputs or multiple-character strings for the variable `ch`.
