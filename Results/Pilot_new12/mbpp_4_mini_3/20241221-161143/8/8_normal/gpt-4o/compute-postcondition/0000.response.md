The code assigns the value of `first_index` to the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. If `ch` is present in `s`, `first_index` will hold a non-negative integer representing the index of that occurrence; if `ch` is not present, `first_index` will hold the value `-1`. The states of `s` and `ch` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found.**
