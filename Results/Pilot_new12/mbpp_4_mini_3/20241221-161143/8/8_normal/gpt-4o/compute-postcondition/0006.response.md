The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string. 

In Case_1, the function returns the string `s` regardless of the values of `ch`, `first_index`, and `last_index`. 

In Case_2, the function returns a new string formed by removing the first and last occurrence of character `ch` from the string `s`. Specifically, it retains the part of the string before the `first_index`, excludes the segment between `first_index` and `last_index` (not including `first_index` and `last_index`), and appends the part after `last_index`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `ch`, returning either the string `s` itself or a modified version of `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed based on certain conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch`, and returns `s` unchanged under certain conditions, or a new string formed by removing the first and last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.**
