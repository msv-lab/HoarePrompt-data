The variable `last_index` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(ch)`, which represents the index of the last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. If `ch` is not found in `s`, `last_index` will be -1. The previous value of `first_index` remains the same, as it is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found.**
