You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's' regardless of the values of 'ch', 'first_index', and 'last_index'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, which is not -1; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, which is not -1; and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns a new string formed by removing the first and last occurrence of character `ch` from the string `s`. The part of the string before `first_index` is kept, the segment between `first_index` and `last_index` is removed (excluding both), and the part after `last_index` is appended.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch`. It checks for the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` does not appear at least twice in `s`, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged. If `ch` appears twice or more, the function returns a new string that removes the first and last occurrences of `ch`, along with anything between these two occurrences. Edge cases to consider include when `ch` is not present in `s`, when `ch` appears only once, and when `s` is empty. The function does not modify the original string and does not perform any error checking for non-string inputs or multiple-character strings for the variable `ch`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
