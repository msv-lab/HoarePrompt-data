Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the functionality as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issues are as follows:

1. **Handling of No Occurrences**: The condition `(first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index)` checks if either the first occurrence or the last occurrence of the character is not found, or if they are the same (which means only one occurrence exists). In these cases, it returns the original string `s`, which does not align with the requirement to remove the first and last occurrences specifically.

2. **Improper Removal Logic**: The line `return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]` removes the characters from `first_index` to `last_index` exclusive. However, it doesn't effectively handle the case where `first_index` and `last_index` are the same, as per the 'or' condition check, leading to a logical flaw.

For example:
- If the input is `func_1('a', 'a')`, according to the code, it will return `s`, which is `'a'`, while the expected behavior should remove both the first and last occurrences, resulting in an empty string `''`.

Due to these flaws in logic and implementation, the program does not adhere to the specified problem description, which requires the removal of both the first and last occurrences of a given character in all applicable cases. Thus, it fails to satisfy the requirements.
