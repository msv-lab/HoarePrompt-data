After carefully analyzing the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment, and the output hints, I will provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness.

First, let's summarize the key aspects:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a string.

2. **Code Behavior**:
   - **Finding Occurrences**: Uses `find()` and `rfind()` to locate the first and last occurrences of `ch`.
   - **Edge Cases**: Returns the original string if `ch`:
     - Does not exist in `s`.
     - Exists only once in `s`.

3. **Original Assessment**: 
   - Correctly identified that the function does not handle the case where `ch` appears once or when all characters are `ch`, leading to the conclusion that it incorrectly processes such cases.
   - Therefore, the original assessment states the correctness of the program is **False**.

4. **Output Hints Analysis**: 
   - The hints confirm that the function does return the original string when `ch` is not present or when it appears only once. This confirms the original assessment that the function does not meet the specified requirement of removing both occurrences in those scenarios.

Given this assessment, the original conclusion provided is justified, as the program does not fulfill the problem description adequately for edge cases. Hence, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **False**
