To determine the correctness of the provided function based on the problem description, I will analyze the implementation against various potential test cases.

### Problem description:
The function should remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

### Test Cases:
1. `func_1('hello', 'l')` should return `'heo'` — Correctly removing the first and last 'l'.
2. `func_1('abcda', 'a')` should return `'bcd'` — Correctly removing the first and last 'a'.
3. `func_1('PHP', 'P')` should return `'H'` — Correctly removing the first and last 'P'.

These test cases work correctly, but let's consider other scenarios:

### Additional Test Cases To Consider:
1. **Edge Case: Empty string** - `func_1('', 'a')` should return `''`. The current code will return `''` correctly because both `find` and `rfind` will return `-1`, and it will hit the return `s` statement.
2. **Character does not exist in the string** - `func_1('test', 'x')` should return `'test'`. The current implementation will return the string untouched, which is correct.
3. **Single character in the string** - `func_1('a', 'a')` should return `''`. The program will recognize that the first and last indices are the same and return the input string unchanged, which is incorrect.
4. **Multiple non-overlapping characters**: `func_1('banana', 'a')` should return `'bnn'`. The function should return 'bnn' successfully, but we need to ensure it behaves consistently when the character occurs less than twice.

### Review of Findings:
- The implementation incorrectly returns the input string when the specified character appears only once in the string. According to the problem description, it should remove that character completely. 
- In the case of `func_1('a', 'a')`, it incorrectly returns the input string instead of an empty string.

### Conclusion:
Since there are cases where the function fails to meet the problem's specification, particularly when the character appears only once, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
