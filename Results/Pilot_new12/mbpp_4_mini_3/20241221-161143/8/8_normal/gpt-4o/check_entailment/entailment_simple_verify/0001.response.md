After analyzing the problem description, the program, the original assessment, and the provided annotated version, I conclude the following:

1. **Problem Description**: The function is described as needing to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from the input string.

2. **Code Behavior**: 
   - The function correctly identifies the indices of the first and last occurrences of the character using `s.find(ch)` and `s.rfind(ch)`.
   - If the character does not exist or if it appears only once, it returns the original string, which is not correct according to the problem description.
   - The logic for cases where the character appears multiple times is correctly implemented.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotation reinforces the idea that the program will return the original string if the character occurs either zero or one time (when `first_index` equals `last_index`).
   - This supports the evaluation that it does not handle cases where a character only appears once as intended.

4. **Original Assessment**: 
   - The original assessment states that the function does not handle cases where the character to be removed appears only once or occupies every position in the string. This reasoning holds true, as the function incorrectly returns the original string in such scenarios.

Given the above points, especially noting that the function fails to meet the problem requirements when the character occurs only once, I maintain the original assessment. 

Final: **False**
