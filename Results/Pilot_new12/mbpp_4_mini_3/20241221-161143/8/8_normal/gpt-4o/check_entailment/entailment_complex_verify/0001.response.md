Final: **False**

The original assessment rightly identifies that the function `func_1` fails to meet the problem description, which requires removing both the first and last occurrences of a given character `ch` from the string `s`. The assessment correctly points out the shortcomings of the function:

1. The function does not handle the case where `ch` only occurs once in the string `s`; it incorrectly returns the original string in this situation.
2. The function does not account for all edge cases, particularly when the string contains only instances of `ch`, leading to incorrect outputs.

The provided annotations confirm that if `first_index` equals `last_index`, the function will return the original string, which contradicts the problem's requirement to remove both the first and last occurrences when they are the same.

Thus, the assessment remains accurate: the function does not correctly solve the problem as stated, and the final conclusion reflects this reasoning.
