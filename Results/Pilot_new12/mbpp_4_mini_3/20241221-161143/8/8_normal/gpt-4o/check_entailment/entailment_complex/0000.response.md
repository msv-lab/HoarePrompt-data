Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the requirement to remove both the first and last occurrence of the character `ch` from the string `s`. 

Here are the reasons for its incorrectness:

1. **Handling of Occurrences**: The return condition `return s` occurs if either `first_index` or `last_index` equals -1 (meaning `ch` does not exist in `s`) or if `first_index` equals `last_index` (indicating `ch` appears only once). This part functions correctly according to the problem description, as it should return the original string when `ch` is not present or present only once.

2. **String Removal Logic**: However, the current implementation of the return statement assumes that when `ch` appears more than once, it correctly removes the first and last occurrences. The slicing logic:
   ```python
   return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
   ```
   incorrectly keeps the characters between the first and last occurrences, which is not what the problem states. The problem requires removing both the first and last occurrence of the character; instead, this implementation results in retaining the segment between them.

   For example, in the case of `func_1('hello', 'l')`, the expected outcome is `'heo'`, while the slicing logic would return `'he'`, resulting in an incorrect output.

Since the implementation does not accurately reflect the problem statement in all cases, especially the handling of characters between the first and last occurrences, it fails to meet the requirements provided.
