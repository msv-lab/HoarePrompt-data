Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the character `ch` does not appear in the string `s`. According to the problem description, if `ch` is not present at all, the function should return the original string unchanged. However, while this part is handled correctly in the code, it fails in scenarios where `ch` only appears once. The original string should be returned unchanged for both cases—a character not present and a character appearing only once—but the code only checks for duplicates. 

For example:
- If we test with `func_1('hello', 'h')`, the original string 'hello' should be returned, but currently, it returns 'hello' which is correct since 'h' does not appear in the string. 

However, if we test with `func_1('abc', 'a')`, it returns 'bc', but 'a' appears only once which is not complying with the problem description as `ch` is removed even when it only appears once.

Therefore, in cases where `ch` appears only once, the program incorrectly modifies the string when it should return it unchanged.
