The original assessment concluded that the provided function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the specified character appears only once in the string. Given the problem description, which states that it should remove the first and last occurrence of the specified character from the string, the observation was correct: if the character appears once, it should be removed completely, resulting in an empty string.

The annotated version of the code provides further clarity on the state of variables throughout the function's execution. The annotation correctly notes that when `first_index` and `last_index` are equal (indicating only a single occurrence of `ch`), the function returns the original string `s`, which is incorrect according to the requirements outlined in the problem description.

In evaluating the correctness of the program against the examples provided, it is clear that the function will not accurately return the expected results under specific circumstances (such as when the character occurs only once), which leads us to conclude that the original assessment is indeed valid.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains unchanged.

Final: **False**
