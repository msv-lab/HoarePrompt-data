To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

**Problem Description**: 
The task requires a function that removes the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a string.

**Given Examples**:
1. Input: 'hello', 'l' → Output: 'heo'
2. Input: 'abcda', 'a' → Output: 'bcd'
3. Input: 'PHP', 'P' → Output: 'H'

**Code Explanation**:
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

1. **Finding Indices**:
   - `first_index` stores the position of the first occurrence of `ch`.
   - `last_index` stores the position of the last occurrence of `ch`.

2. **Edge Cases Managed**:
   - If `ch` is not found (either `first_index` or `last_index` is -1), it returns the original string.
   - If `ch` occurs only once (`first_index` is equal to `last_index`), it also returns the original string.

3. **Returning the Modified String**:
   - It builds a new string by concatenating:
     - The part of the string before the first occurrence of `ch`.
     - The part of the string between the first and last occurrence of `ch`, effectively removing the first occurrence.
     - The part of the string after the last occurrence of `ch`, thus removing the last occurrence.

**Potential Missing Cases**:
Let's consider some edge cases to evaluate if the function behaves correctly:
- Input: `func_1('a', 'a')` should return an empty string `''` but will return `'a'` since `first_index` equals `last_index` (both are 0).
- Input: `func_1('aaa', 'a')` should return `'a'`, removing the first 'a' and last 'a', but will return `'a'` because `first_index` equals `last_index` (both are 0).

Since the function does not handle cases where the character to be removed appears only once or when the character occupies every position in a string, it violates the requirements as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

The function does not correctly handle the case where the specified character occurs exactly once or when the string consists only of the character to be removed.
