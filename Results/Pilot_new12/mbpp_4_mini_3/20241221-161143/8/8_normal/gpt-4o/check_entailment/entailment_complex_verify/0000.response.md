The original assessment conducted a thorough analysis of the function `func_1`, including various test cases that examined different scenarios as specified in the problem description. The evaluation noted specifically that the function correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the specified character for many cases.

However, the function is not correct when the specified character appears only once in the string. In this case, the function returns the original string instead of removing that single occurrence, which contradicts the requirement outlined in the problem description. The annotated code highlights that if the character does not occur at least twice, the function simply returns the input string unchanged, which is incorrect behavior based on the problem statement.

Given this critical oversight, the conclusion of the original assessment that the implementation was correct does not align with the specified requirements.

Therefore, I am refining the assessment based on the findings from the analysis of the annotations and the problem description.

Final: **False**
