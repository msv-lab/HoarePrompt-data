Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program is intended to compute the n-th Lucas number. However, the implementation actually calculates the n-th Fibonacci number, not the n-th Lucas number. According to the problem description, the function must find the n-th Lucas number, which follows a different sequence defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The code calculates the Fibonacci sequence instead:

- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

The error lies in the comments explaining that the function returns the n-th Lucas number, while it actually returns the n-th Fibonacci number, which does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, since the program does not correctly compute the n-th Lucas number as stated in the problem description, it is incorrect.
