The program provided calculates the n-th Lucas number, which is defined similarly to the Fibonacci numbers, with the first two Lucas numbers being 2 and 1. 

Reviewing the code:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

Output hints indicate that:
- The function returns 2 if `n` is 0.
- The function returns 1 if `n` is 1.
- For `n > 1`, it calculates what it describes as the n-th Fibonacci number by cycling through a loop which updates `a` and `b`.

Now considering the hint about returning a Fibonacci number for `n > 1` is a concern. The Lucas sequence does not match the Fibonacci sequence beyond the first two elements, which indicates a flaw in the logic. For example:

- The 3rd Lucas number is 3 (not computed correctly by the program).
- The 4th Lucas number is 4 (also not computed correctly).
- The 5th Lucas number is 7 (also not computed correctly).

The output hints also mention that the function doesn't account for negative integers, but since we assume that `n` is a valid non-negative integer, this is acceptable.

Thus, the issue arises because the logic for computing the Lucas numbers is flawedâ€”it incorrectly performs the Fibonacci sequence calculation instead of the correct Lucas number calculation.

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program miscalculates the Lucas numbers for `n > 1`. Instead of computing the correct Lucas numbers which follow the recurrence relation L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) with starting values L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, it incorrectly uses the Fibonacci recurrence relation, resulting in incorrect values for higher indices.
