You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description provided, we need to analyze the program carefully.

**Problem description**: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

### Analysis:
The Lucas numbers are a sequence of numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different starting values. The **Lucas numbers** are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n > 1, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

In the given program:
- When `n == 0`, it correctly returns 2 (the first Lucas number).
- When `n == 1`, it correctly returns 1 (the second Lucas number).
- For `n > 1`, it starts with `a = 2` (L(0)) and `b = 1` (L(1)). 

The program then iteratively calculates the next Lucas numbers using the formula L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2). The loop runs from 2 up to n, and during each iteration, it updates a and b such that:
- `a` holds L(n-1),
- `b` holds L(n).

After the loop completes, it returns b, which will be L(n).

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **n = 0**: Returns 2, correct.
2. **n = 1**: Returns 1, correct.
3. **n = 2**: 
   - L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3.
   - The loop runs once (for _ in range(2, 3)), updating (a, b) from (2, 1) to (1, 3) and returns 3, which is correct.
4. **n = 3**: 
   - L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4.
   - The loop iterates twice, updating (a, b) from (2, 1) -> (1, 3) -> (3, 4) and returns 4, which is correct.
5. **n = 4**: 
   - L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7.
   - The loop iterates, yielding (2, 1) -> (1, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 7), returns 7, which is correct.
   
The pattern continues inductively for all n, and based on the logic in the code, all cases will yield the correct Lucas number.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly produces output for the described problem without any edge cases leading to failure, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns the value 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1, where n is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and its current value is equal to 1.
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the (n-1)-th Fibonacci number, `b` is the n-th Fibonacci number.
            return b
            #The program returns the n-th Fibonacci number which is represented by variable 'b'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
