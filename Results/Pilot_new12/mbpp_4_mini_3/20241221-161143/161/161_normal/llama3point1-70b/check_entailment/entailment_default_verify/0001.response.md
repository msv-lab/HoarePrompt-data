The analysis of the problem description, the program provided, the original assessment, and the output hints shows some critical points regarding the correctness of the implementation.

1. **Problem Description and Program Logic:**
   - The problem description clearly states that the goal is to find the n-th Lucas number.
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the Lucas sequence with the base cases \( L(0) = 2 \) and \( L(1) = 1 \). For \( n \geq 2 \), the code computes subsequent values accurately using an iterative approach.

2. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment identified that the function correctly implements the logic for calculating the n-th Lucas number but noted a significant issue: the function does not account for negative integers since the problem description does not specify behavior for such inputs. Therefore, this raises a concern about the completeness of the implementation in regard to the problem description.

3. **Contradicting Output Hints:**
   - The output hints affirm that the function correctly returns values for non-negative integers and that it assumes valid inputs. However, the phrasing regarding “does not account for negative integers” indicates an oversight related to input validation.

4. **Consideration of Input Validity:**
   - Since the problem description did not explicitly state how to handle negative integers and the output hints specify that the function accepts only non-negative integers, if we operate under the assumption that the user will always provide permissible inputs, then the function correctly fulfills the requirements laid out in the problem description for valid non-negative integers.

Given these points, the original assessment may not be entirely justified if the assumption of valid inputs is strictly upheld; thus, it can be interpreted that the function behaves as intended within the permitted input domain (non-negative integers). 

Therefore, after careful consideration, we can refine the assessment:

Final: **True**
