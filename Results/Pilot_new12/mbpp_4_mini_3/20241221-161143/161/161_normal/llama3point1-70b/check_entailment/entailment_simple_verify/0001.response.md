To evaluate the correctness of the program against the problem description and the provided annotations, we will carefully consider the original assessment and the implications of the annotations.

**Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the n-th Lucas number defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n â‰¥ 2, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

**Program Overview**:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that follows the Lucas sequence as stated in the problem description. The function handles the base cases correctly and computes subsequent Lucas numbers in a loop for values of `n` greater than 1.

**Original Assessment**: 
The assessment accurately describes the correctness of the function for non-negative integers but notes a limitation: the function does not handle negative inputs and assumes that the user will provide valid inputs.

- The assessment correctly identifies:
  1. The handling of base cases.
  2. The loop's logic to calculate subsequent terms in the Lucas sequence.

The statement concludes with the remark that due to the inability to handle negative inputs, the correctness of the program is considered **False**.

**Annotated Code**: 
The annotations indicate:
- Before the function call, `n` is assumed to be a non-negative integer.
- The function returns the correct Lucas number values according to established definitions through valid transitions.

**Final Assessment**: 
Given that the original assessment points out correctly that the function is only verified for non-negative integers while acknowledging that it does not handle negative inputs. However, the program's behavior is explicit for valid (non-negative) input as per the problem description. Since we're assuming that valid input (non-negative integers) will be provided as specified by the annotations, the primary function of finding the n-th Lucas number is executed correctly.

Thus, based on the given information and assuming that inputs will adhere to the expectations laid out in the problem description and annotated code, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
