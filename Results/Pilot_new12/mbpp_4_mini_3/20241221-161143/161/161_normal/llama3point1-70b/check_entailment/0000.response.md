To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description provided, we need to analyze the program carefully.

**Problem description**: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

### Analysis:
The Lucas numbers are a sequence of numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different starting values. The **Lucas numbers** are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n > 1, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

In the given program:
- When `n == 0`, it correctly returns 2 (the first Lucas number).
- When `n == 1`, it correctly returns 1 (the second Lucas number).
- For `n > 1`, it starts with `a = 2` (L(0)) and `b = 1` (L(1)). 

The program then iteratively calculates the next Lucas numbers using the formula L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2). The loop runs from 2 up to n, and during each iteration, it updates a and b such that:
- `a` holds L(n-1),
- `b` holds L(n).

After the loop completes, it returns b, which will be L(n).

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **n = 0**: Returns 2, correct.
2. **n = 1**: Returns 1, correct.
3. **n = 2**: 
   - L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3.
   - The loop runs once (for _ in range(2, 3)), updating (a, b) from (2, 1) to (1, 3) and returns 3, which is correct.
4. **n = 3**: 
   - L(3) = L(2) + L(1) = 3 + 1 = 4.
   - The loop iterates twice, updating (a, b) from (2, 1) -> (1, 3) -> (3, 4) and returns 4, which is correct.
5. **n = 4**: 
   - L(4) = L(3) + L(2) = 4 + 3 = 7.
   - The loop iterates, yielding (2, 1) -> (1, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 7), returns 7, which is correct.
   
The pattern continues inductively for all n, and based on the logic in the code, all cases will yield the correct Lucas number.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly produces output for the described problem without any edge cases leading to failure, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
