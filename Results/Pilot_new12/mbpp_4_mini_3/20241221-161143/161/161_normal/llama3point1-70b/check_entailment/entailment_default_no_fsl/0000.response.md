Correctness: **False**

The provided program claims to compute the n-th Lucas number based on the problem description. However, it incorrectly calculates Fibonacci numbers for n greater than 1 instead of Lucas numbers. 

For example:
- The Lucas sequence starts with L(0) = 2, L(1) = 1, and then follows the relation L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2).
- However, for n = 2, according to the Lucas sequence, L(2) should be 3 (1 + 2), but the program actually returns 3, which is correct for Fibonacci but not for Lucas since it should be L(3) based on recursive definition not L(2).

Thus, the program does not compute the n-th Lucas number correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for values of n > 2.
