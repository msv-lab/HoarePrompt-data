The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where `n` is negative. However, it assumed that the input would be valid and did not account for negative integers, as stated in the annotations.

After reviewing the annotations and the explanation provided, we find the following:

1. The annotated version confirms that the function handles the cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1` correctly, returning 2 and 1, respectively.
2. For `n > 1`, the function computes the n-th Lucas number correctly by updating the variables `a` and `b` in the for loop as intended.
3. The annotations specify that the function assumes `n` is a non-negative integer, which aligns with the problem statement stating that the task is to find the n-th Lucas number.

Since the assessment indicates that the function does not account for negative integers—which we are assuming will not be provided as input—the rest of the functionality works as intended. Consequently, the program does meet the problem description for valid, non-negative integer inputs.

Given this reasoning, I maintain that the original assessment contains an unnecessary assertion regarding negative inputs, which does not apply based on the provided conditions.

Final: **True**
