You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program in finding the n-th Lucas number, we must first understand the Lucas number sequence.

The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n >= 2, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

Given this definition, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```

1. The code correctly handles the base cases:
   - When `n == 0`, it returns 2.
   - When `n == 1`, it returns 1.

2. For `n >= 2`, it initializes `a` to L(0) = 2 and `b` to L(1) = 1. It then computes the subsequent Lucas numbers in a loop until it reaches L(n).

3. The logic in the for loop correctly updates `a` and `b` to hold the last two computed values of the sequence. Specifically:
   - `a` represents L(n-2)
   - `b` represents L(n-1)
   - The line `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` updates `b` to the next Lucas number, L(n), at each iteration.

After reviewing the code and the logic implemented, we can conclude that it correctly calculates the n-th Lucas number according to the established series.

We also need to consider edge cases:
- What happens if n < 0? The problem description does not specify the expected behavior for negative indices. The code does not handle negative inputs and will lead to incorrect results as it assumes n is always non-negative.

Since the program does not account for all potential cases (specifically when n is negative), we can conclude the following:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and calculates the n-th Fibonacci number for `n` greater than 1, represented by the variable `b`. The function does not account for negative integers, as it assumes `n` is non-negative, and correctly handles the Fibonacci series for valid non-negative integers. Therefore, for valid inputs, it either returns a predefined value or computes the desired Fibonacci number.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
