`a` is assigned the value of `b`, which is 1. `b` is assigned the new value of `a + b`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. The variable `n` remains unaffected as it is not involved in the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 2 (as the first iteration).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 2 (as the first iteration)**.
