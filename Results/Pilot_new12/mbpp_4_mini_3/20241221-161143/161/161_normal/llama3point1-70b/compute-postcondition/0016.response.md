Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and calculates the n-th Fibonacci number for `n` greater than 1, represented by the variable `b`. The function does not account for negative integers, as it assumes `n` is non-negative, and correctly handles the Fibonacci series for valid non-negative integers. Therefore, for valid inputs, it either returns a predefined value or computes the desired Fibonacci number.**
