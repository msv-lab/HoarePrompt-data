According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute again if the value of `_` (which represents the current iteration of the loop) is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. 

For the next iteration to occur, `_` will be increased by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3. 

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 3**
