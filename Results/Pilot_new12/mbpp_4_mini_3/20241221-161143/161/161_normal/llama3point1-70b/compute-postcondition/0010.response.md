The code assigns the values of `b` and `a + b` to `a` and `b`, respectively. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. After executing the line `a, b = b, a + b`, the values will be updated as follows:

- `a` will take the value of `b`, which is 3.
- `b` will take the value of `a + b`, which is 1 + 3 = 4.

The initial conditions regarding `n` remain valid, and only the values of `a` and `b` change.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 3**
