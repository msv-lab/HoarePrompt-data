According to the code, the loop will execute if the range specified in `range(2, n + 1)` generates any values. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, greater than 0, and not equal to 1, it guarantees that the loop will execute. The start of the range is 2, and the end of the range is `n + 1`, which means:

- If `n = 2`, the loop will iterate once with `_` being `2`.
- If `n > 2`, the loop will iterate multiple times.

Since the loop range starts at 2, for the loop to run, the first value of `_` is indeed 2 when `n` is 2 or any value greater than that.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `_` is 2 (as the first iteration)*.**
