In the provided code, `a` and `b` are simultaneously assigned new values based on their current values. The value of `b` will become the old value of `a + b`, and the new value of `a` will just be the old value of `b`. Given the initial states, `a` starts at 3 and `b` starts at 4.

1. The current value of `a` is 3 and the current value of `b` is 4. 
2. Applying the swap:
   - `b` will be updated to `a + b`, which is `3 + 4 = 7`.
   - `a` will be updated to the old value of `b`, which is `4`.

Now the values are updated accordingly, while the conditions regarding `n` still hold true (as it remains greater than 4).

Therefore, the updated values and valid conditions are:
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `a` is now 4
- `b` is now 7
- `_` is still 4

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7, `_` is 4**.
