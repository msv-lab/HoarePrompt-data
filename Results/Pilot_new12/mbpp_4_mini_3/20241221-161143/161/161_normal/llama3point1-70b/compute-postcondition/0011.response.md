According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop operates over a range from 2 to `n + 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 3, and `_` is currently 3. Since the loop starts at 2 and continues as long as `_` is less than `n + 1`, the next value of `_` will be 4. 

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4 to allow `_` to be 4, making `_` equal to 4 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 4**
