The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values 2 and 1, respectively. The initial state of `n` is unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, after the code execution, the values of `a` and `b` have changed, while the condition regarding `n` remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2, `b` is 1**.
