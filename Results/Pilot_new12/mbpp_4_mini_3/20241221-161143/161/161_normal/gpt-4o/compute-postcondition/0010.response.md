The values of `a` and `b` are assigned as follows: `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`. Initially, `a` is 3 and `b` is 2. Thus, `a` will now be 2, and `b` will be 3 + 2 = 5. The states of `n` remains unaffected as it is not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `a` is 2; `b` is 5.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3; `a` is 2; `b` is 5**
