According to the code, the loop iterates over a range that starts at 2 and goes up to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 because the range will generate no values if `n` is less than 2. Given the provided state, `n` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, which means `n` must be at least 2. 

Since `n` is greater than 0 and specifically not equal to 1, it will execute as long as `n` is set to 2 or a higher integer. Furthermore, since the loop iterates using `_`, the current iteration value doesn't need to be tracked.

The final state should thus ensure that the execution conditions for the loop are satisfied without modifying any of the existing values unnecessarily.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
