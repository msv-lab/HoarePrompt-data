According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, inclusive, meaning it will execute as long as the value of `_` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, which means the loop has currently executed for `_` values 2 and 3 (if `n` is exactly 3). The next value of `_` would be 4 if the loop were to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4. 

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4,
- `_` (the loop variable) will be 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 5, `_` is 4**
