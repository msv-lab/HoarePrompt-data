The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the constant values of 2 and 1, respectively. The states of the other variables, including `n`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2, `b` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2, `b` is 1**.
