The variables `a` and `b` are assigned new values based on the tuple unpacking syntax. Specifically, `a` takes the old value of `b`, which is 5, and `b` takes the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is 2 + 5 = 7. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 4, and the value of `n` is not directly affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 5, `b` is 7, `_` is 4**
