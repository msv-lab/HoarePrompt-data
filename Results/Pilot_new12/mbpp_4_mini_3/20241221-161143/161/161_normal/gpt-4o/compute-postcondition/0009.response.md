According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `n`. The loop starts at 2 and continues until it reaches `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, leading to the previous iteration potentially starting at 2 and going to `n`. If `n` is 2, the loop has executed once and would not execute again, but if `n` is greater than 2, we can expect one more iteration. 

So, to allow the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue executing. 
- The loop variable `_` takes on the values starting from 2, meaning if the loop executed once (for the value 2), the next value will be 3.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted accordingly:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 2**
