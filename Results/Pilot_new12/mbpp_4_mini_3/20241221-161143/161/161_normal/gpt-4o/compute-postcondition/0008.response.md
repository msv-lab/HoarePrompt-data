The values of `a` and `b` are swapped where `a` is assigned the value of `b` and `b` is assigned the value of `a + b`. Given the initial values `a` is 2 and `b` is 1, after executing the code:

1. `b` takes the initial value of `a`, which is 2.
2. `a` takes the sum of the initial values of `a` and `b`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Therefore, the updated values of the variables after execution are:
- `a` becomes 3
- `b` becomes 2

The initial condition regarding `n` remains valid since it wasn't affected by the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 2**
