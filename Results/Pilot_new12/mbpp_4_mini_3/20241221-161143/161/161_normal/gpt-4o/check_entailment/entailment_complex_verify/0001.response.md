Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program correctly implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number, which aligns with the problem description. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code and the definitions related to the Lucas numbers, there is an important discrepancy. 

In the annotated section, it states: "For values of n greater than 1, it returns the Fibonacci-like value at index `n + 1`". This indicates that the return value for `n >= 2` is actually the (n + 1)-th Fibonacci number, rather than the n-th Lucas number. The correct Lucas number sequence should return `L(n)`, but the implementation is returning `L(n+1)` instead. 

Thus, while the code handles edge cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1` correctly, it does not compute the n-th Lucas number correctly for `n >= 2`. Since the requirement explicitly states to find the n-th Lucas number, the function does not meet the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the original assessment is incorrect. Therefore, the final result must reflect this misunderstanding regarding the function's output.

Given this analysis, the program does not meet the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the function is incorrect.
