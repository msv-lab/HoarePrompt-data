Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description for finding the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The provided function, however, computes a value based on a Fibonacci-like sequence where the initial values are set to 2 and 1. 

Specifically, the issue arises in the following parts:

1. The function claims to return the value at index `n` as a Lucas number, but due to the way the loop is set up, it actually returns the Fibonacci-like number at index `n + 1` where `a` is incorrectly initialized.

2. For `n = 2`, the expected Lucas number is 3, but according to the logic in the code, it would compute a Fibonacci-like number that does not match the definition of the Lucas sequence. 

3. The assertions provided in the code also do not align with the true values of the Lucas sequence. For example, `func_1(9)` is expected to return `76`, which is correct, but the underlying method to compute that as a Lucas number is flawed because the logic is being implemented with Fibonacci-like recursion instead.

Since the function does not accurately calculate the n-th Lucas number as defined in the problem description, we conclude the program does not implement the correct logic or return the correct values for all cases.
