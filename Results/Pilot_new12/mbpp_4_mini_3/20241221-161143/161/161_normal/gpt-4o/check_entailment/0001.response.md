Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

The function `func_1` correctly handles the base cases (`n == 0` and `n == 1`), returning 2 and 1 respectively. For values of `n` greater than 1, it uses a loop to compute the Lucas numbers iteratively, storing the results of the two most recent numbers in the sequence. 

The assertions provided in the program also verify expected outputs for specific inputs, and the values returned by the function for those inputs match the definition of Lucas numbers:

- `func_1(9)` returns 76, which is correct.
- `func_1(4)` returns 7, which is correct.
- `func_1(3)` returns 4, which is correct.

Since all tested cases are correct and the function implements the logic accurately for all other potential cases, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
