Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the computation of the n-th Lucas number. The recursive definitions of the Lucas numbers are well-defined: `L(0) = 2`, `L(1) = 1`, and for `n >= 2`, `L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)`. The function handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` properly. 

In the loop, it uses the proper iterative method to calculate subsequent Lucas numbers from the previously calculated values, ensuring that all values up to `n` are computed accurately. The test cases provided (`func_1(9) == 76`, `func_1(4) == 7`, and `func_1(3) == 4`) also confirm that the implementation is correct for those specific values. 

Since the function produces the expected results for the test cases, and adheres to the definition of the Lucas sequence, there are no failing cases found where the program does not work as expected. Thus, the program is correct in accordance with the problem description.
