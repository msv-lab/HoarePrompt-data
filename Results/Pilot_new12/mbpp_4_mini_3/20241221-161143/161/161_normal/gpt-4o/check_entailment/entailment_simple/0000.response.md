Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to compute the n-th Lucas number, but it incorrectly describes its computation method as if it were calculating Fibonacci numbers. 

In the Lucas sequence, the first few values are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

However, the program computes the n-th value using the formula that resembles Fibonacci numbers, returning the value of `b`, which represents L(n + 1) at the end of the loop rather than L(n). Therefore, the assertions related to the function call will not yield correct results for the Lucas sequence:

For instance, it is expected that:
- `func_1(9)` should return L(9) = 76 (which is correctly called in the assertion, but logically flawed in the computation part)
- However, due to its implementation, it will not yield the correct Lucas number for inputs greater than 1.

The program fails to compute the correct n-th Lucas number due to this miscalculation, thus failing to meet the requirements of the problem description consistently.
