Upon analysis of the program, the problem description, and the provided annotations, the following points can be observed:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to implement a function to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as:
   - \(L(0) = 2\)
   - \(L(1) = 1\)
   - For \(n \geq 2\), \(L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\)

2. **Program Implementation**: The `func_1` function implements this logic correctly:
   - It explicitly returns the correct base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - It computes subsequent Lucas numbers iteratively for `n >= 2` using a while loop, which is correctly structured to calculate \(L(n)\) by updating `a` and `b`.

3. **Annotated Code**: The annotations correctly state the flow of values and maintain the order of operations within the function. The program correctly computes and returns Lucas numbers, which aligns with the problem requirements.

4. **Assessment of Test Cases**:
   - `func_1(9)`: The output should be `76` (which is \(L(9)\)), confirms the logic for calculating Lucas numbers is correctly implemented in the iteration.
   - `func_1(4)`: The output should be `7`, which aligns with \(L(4)\).
   - `func_1(3)`: The output should be `4`, which is consistent with \(L(3)\).

Based on these observations, the original assessment that the function correctly implements the computation of the n-th Lucas number is valid and supported by both the implementation details and the annotations.

Thus, the final assessment of the program's correctness is as follows:

Final: **True**
