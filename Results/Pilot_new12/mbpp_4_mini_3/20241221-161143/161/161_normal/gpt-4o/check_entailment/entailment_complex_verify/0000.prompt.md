You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the computation of the n-th Lucas number. The recursive definitions of the Lucas numbers are well-defined: `L(0) = 2`, `L(1) = 1`, and for `n >= 2`, `L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)`. The function handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` properly. 

In the loop, it uses the proper iterative method to calculate subsequent Lucas numbers from the previously calculated values, ensuring that all values up to `n` are computed accurately. The test cases provided (`func_1(9) == 76`, `func_1(4) == 7`, and `func_1(3) == 4`) also confirm that the implementation is correct for those specific values. 

Since the function produces the expected results for the test cases, and adheres to the definition of the Lucas sequence, there are no failing cases found where the program does not work as expected. Thus, the program is correct in accordance with the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns the value 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `a` is the Fibonacci-like value at index `n`, `b` is the Fibonacci-like value at index `n + 1`.
            return b
            #The program returns the Fibonacci-like value at index n + 1, denoted as b, where n is a positive integer greater than 1 and a is the Fibonacci-like value at index n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n`. It returns:
- The value 2 if `n` is 0.
- The value 1 if `n` is 1.
- For values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the Fibonacci-like value at index `n + 1`, calculated iteratively using the Fibonacci sequence logic, where the value at index `n` is represented by `a` and the value at index `n + 1` is represented by `b`. 

The function handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` explicitly, ensuring correct outputs for these edge cases. In case of `n` being 2 or greater, it computes the next Fibonacci number starting from the first two Fibonacci-like numbers (2 and 1) and iteratively derives the subsequent values, hence returning the value for `b`. The function does not have guard clauses for negative integers, but is designed to operate effectively within the domain of non-negative integers only, as per the specified precondition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
