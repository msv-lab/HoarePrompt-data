Final: **False**

The original assessment incorrectly stated that the program implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number correctly. While the program does handle the base cases properly for \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \), the logic in the `else` clause is incorrect. The loop is meant to compute the n-th Lucas number, but the program states that it is returning the "Fibonacci-like value at index n + 1." The actual implementation is iterating and returning a value that would correspond to the Fibonacci sequence rather than the correct Lucas sequence.

In particular, the variable `b` is defined as the value at index \( n + 1 \) in a sequence that does not match the definition of the Lucas numbers. According to the Lucas number definition, each term is the sum of the two preceding terms in the sequence starting with 2 and 1. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not adhere to the problem description of finding the n-th Lucas number.

Therefore, upon evaluation with the provided annotations, the conclusion is that the original assessment was not accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the n-th Lucas number, leading to the assessment of the program's correctness as false.
