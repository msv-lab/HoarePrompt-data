Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program correctly implements the computation of the n-th Lucas number, which indeed adheres to the definition of the Lucas sequence: `L(0) = 2`, `L(1) = 1`, and for `n >= 2`, `L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)`. However, upon review of the program's implementation and the annotated version, there is an inconsistency in the loop that calculates the next values.

The program mistakenly states that `a` and `b` are initialized to values corresponding to the Fibonacci sequence with `a` set to `2` and `b` set to `1`. The iterative operation in the loop actually computes Fibonacci numbers rather than Lucas numbers after the base cases. The annotated code states that `b` becomes the Fibonacci-like value at index `n + 1`, which indicates that it does not fulfill the requirement to compute the n-th Lucas number correctly for all cases when `n â‰¥ 2`.

Thus, while it produces the correct output for certain test cases, it does not consistently produce the right values for all Lucas numbers, particularly for values beyond 1. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program indeed does not meet the problem description's requirement for calculating Lucas numbers.
