Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the nth Lucas number as specified in the problem description. The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

However, the logic in the function `func_1` calculates values that resemble the Fibonacci sequence instead of the Lucas sequence. Specifically, the program iteratively updates `a` and `b` in a manner similar to how Fibonacci numbers are generated, leading it to return values that are incorrect when `n > 1`.

For example:
- For n = 2, the expected Lucas number is L(2) = 3, but the function will return 2 (since `b` is initialized to 1 and the value of `b` does not correctly capture the Lucas sequence progression).
- For n = 5, the expected Lucas number is L(5) = 11, but testing this value would also yield an incorrect result based on the existing logic.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases.
