Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the calculation of the n-th Lucas number as defined in the problem description. The function `func_1` handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` by returning 2 and 1, respectively. For values of `n` greater than 1, it correctly utilizes an iterative approach to derive subsequent Lucas numbers, consistent with the sequence's definition (L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)). 

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, detailing the return values for the specified inputs, and provide an assessment of how values are calculated. The program's assertions validate its correctness for at least three cases, all of which align with known values in the Lucas sequence. 

Thus, the evidence supports that the implementation is correct, ensuring that the final assessment remains: True.
