Explanation: The code seems to provide the correct Lucas number for non-negative integers based on the Fibonacci-like recurrence relations defined for the Lucas sequence. The base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` are handled explicitly as expected. For every value of `n` greater than 1, the code calculates the Lucas numbers correctly, returning the `n`-th value through iteration which respects the defined sequence logic originating from 2 and 1. 

However, there is no provision for error handling if a negative integer is passed to `func_1`, meaning the function could behave unexpectedly if that were to happen. Nonetheless, as stated in the problem context, the function is assumed to only work for non-negative integers, and such edge cases are not part of the explicit requirements.

The output hints align with the program's logic, confirming that it accurately represents the recursive structure of the Lucas numbers.

Correctness: **True**.
