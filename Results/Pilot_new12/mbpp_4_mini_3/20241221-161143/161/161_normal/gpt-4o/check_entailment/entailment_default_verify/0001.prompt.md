You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

The function `func_1` correctly handles the base cases (`n == 0` and `n == 1`), returning 2 and 1 respectively. For values of `n` greater than 1, it uses a loop to compute the Lucas numbers iteratively, storing the results of the two most recent numbers in the sequence. 

The assertions provided in the program also verify expected outputs for specific inputs, and the values returned by the function for those inputs match the definition of Lucas numbers:

- `func_1(9)` returns 76, which is correct.
- `func_1(4)` returns 7, which is correct.
- `func_1(3)` returns 4, which is correct.

Since all tested cases are correct and the function implements the logic accurately for all other potential cases, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n`. It returns:
- The value 2 if `n` is 0.
- The value 1 if `n` is 1.
- For values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the Fibonacci-like value at index `n + 1`, calculated iteratively using the Fibonacci sequence logic, where the value at index `n` is represented by `a` and the value at index `n + 1` is represented by `b`. 

The function handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` explicitly, ensuring correct outputs for these edge cases. In case of `n` being 2 or greater, it computes the next Fibonacci number starting from the first two Fibonacci-like numbers (2 and 1) and iteratively derives the subsequent values, hence returning the value for `b`. The function does not have guard clauses for negative integers, but is designed to operate effectively within the domain of non-negative integers only, as per the specified precondition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
