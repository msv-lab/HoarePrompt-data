Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program correctly implements the computation of the n-th Lucas number based on its definition: `L(0) = 2`, `L(1) = 1`, and for `n >= 2`, `L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)`. The function handles the base cases properly and uses an iterative approach to compute values for `n >= 2`, which is efficient and ensures correctness. 

The provided output hints support this assessment, as they clearly state the expected behavior of the function for various inputs, and they confirm the implementation's alignment with the definition of Lucas numbers. Additionally, the test cases validate that the function produces the correct output for the specified values of `n`. Thus, the program meets the problem description and maintains the integrity of its logic, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.
