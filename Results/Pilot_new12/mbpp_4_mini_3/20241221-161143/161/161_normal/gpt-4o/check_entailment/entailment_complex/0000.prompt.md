You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns the value 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `a` is the Fibonacci-like value at index `n`, `b` is the Fibonacci-like value at index `n + 1`.
            return b
            #The program returns the Fibonacci-like value at index n + 1, denoted as b, where n is a positive integer greater than 1 and a is the Fibonacci-like value at index n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n`. It returns:
- The value 2 if `n` is 0.
- The value 1 if `n` is 1.
- For values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the Fibonacci-like value at index `n + 1`, calculated iteratively using the Fibonacci sequence logic, where the value at index `n` is represented by `a` and the value at index `n + 1` is represented by `b`. 

The function handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` explicitly, ensuring correct outputs for these edge cases. In case of `n` being 2 or greater, it computes the next Fibonacci number starting from the first two Fibonacci-like numbers (2 and 1) and iteratively derives the subsequent values, hence returning the value for `b`. The function does not have guard clauses for negative integers, but is designed to operate effectively within the domain of non-negative integers only, as per the specified precondition.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
