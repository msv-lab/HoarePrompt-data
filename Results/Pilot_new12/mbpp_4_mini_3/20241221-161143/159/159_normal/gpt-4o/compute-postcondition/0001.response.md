The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are positive numbers. The function calculates the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius^2 * height and returns this volume. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive numbers, `radius` and `height`, and return the calculated volume of a cone based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, radius and height, both of which are positive numbers, and returns the volume of a cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius^2 * height.**
