Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies the program as functioning properly to calculate the volume of a cone based on the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The provided assert statements demonstrate that the function `func_1` produces accurate results for the given test cases, matching the expected volume of a cone within a reasonable tolerance. The annotations also support this by confirming that the inputs are positive numbers, which is a necessary condition for correctly applying the cone volume formula. Since both the program's implementation and the annotations align with the problem description without any identified errors or edge cases, the original assessment of correctness is validated.
