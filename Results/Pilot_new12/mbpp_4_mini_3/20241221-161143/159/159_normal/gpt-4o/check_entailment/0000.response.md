Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The given test cases verify its correctness for different values of radius and height, and they produce results that match the expected output to a reasonable precision. As no potential edge cases or errors in logic were found that would cause incorrect results, the program can be confidently considered correct.
