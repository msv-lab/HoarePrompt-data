Final: **False**

The original assessment indicates the program is correct, which is supported by the formula used and the results for the given test cases. However, the output hints explicitly state that the function does not handle edge cases such as negative or zero input values. This lack of input validation means the function is not robust, as it may produce incorrect results or errors if it receives invalid inputs. Therefore, while the function currently works for the provided test cases (valid inputs), the original assessment fails to consider the absence of validation and the potential for errors with other inputs, leading to the conclusion that it does not fully meet the problem description in ensuring correct behavior across all possible inputs.
