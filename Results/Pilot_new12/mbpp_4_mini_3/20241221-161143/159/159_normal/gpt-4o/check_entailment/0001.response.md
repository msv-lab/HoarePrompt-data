To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description of finding the volume of a cone, we need to evaluate whether the formula used is correct and whether edge cases are handled properly.

### Problem Description:
The volume \( V \) of a cone can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

### Program Code:
```python
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(10, 15), 1570.7963267948965, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(19, 17), 6426.651371693521, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
```

### Analysis:
1. **Correctness of Volume Formula**: The function `func_1` uses the correct formula to calculate the volume of a cone.

2. **Test Cases**: The test cases provided use assertions to validate outputs against the expected values:
   - For \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 12 \): 
     - Expected Volume = \( \frac{1}{3} \pi (5^2)(12) = 314.15926535897927 \) (Correct)
   - For \( r = 10 \) and \( h = 15 \):
     - Expected Volume = \( \frac{1}{3} \pi (10^2)(15) = 1570.7963267948965 \) (Correct)
   - For \( r = 19 \) and \( h = 17 \): 
     - Expected Volume = \( \frac{1}{3} \pi (19^2)(17) = 6426.651371693521 \) (Correct)

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program does not explicitly handle cases where `radius` or `height` could be zero or negative. According to the geometric definition of a cone:
     - If **radius** is **0**, the volume should also be **0**. The current implementation will return **0**, which is correct.
     - If **height** is **0**, the volume should again be **0**. The implementation will also correctly return **0** in this case.
     - If either `radius` or `height` is **negative**, the resulting volume is not meaningful, but the program will still compute a volume based on the formula, potentially leading to negative values, which is incorrect for physical dimensions.

4. **Conclusion**: While the volume calculation is correct for valid non-negative inputs, the absence of checks for non-negative inputs and handling negative values indicates that the program does not comply fully with the problem description, which implies that it should not allow such cases.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **False** 

This determination is based on the fact that the program does not account for the invalid state of negative inputs and directly uses them in calculations, producing non-physical results.
