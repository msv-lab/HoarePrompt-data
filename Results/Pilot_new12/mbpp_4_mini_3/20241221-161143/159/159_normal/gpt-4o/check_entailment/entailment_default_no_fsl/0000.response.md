Correctness: **False**

The program calculates the volume of a cone correctly using the formula \((1/3) * \pi * radius^2 * height\). However, it does not handle cases where the input for `radius` or `height` could be negative or zero. The output hints specifically indicate that the function does not manage these edge cases. Therefore, if the user inputs negative values or zero, the function will fail to provide a meaningful output, which means it does not abide by the problem description for every potential case. 

For example, calling `func_1(0, 5)` or `func_1(-1, 5)` would result in incorrect outputs (i.e., 0 and a negative volume respectively), violating the expected behavior. Thus, the program is incomplete and cannot be considered correct.
