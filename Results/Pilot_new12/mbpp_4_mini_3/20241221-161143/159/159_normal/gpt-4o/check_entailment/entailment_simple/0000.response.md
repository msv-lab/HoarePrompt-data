Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the computation of the volume of a cone as defined in the problem description. 

The formula for the volume of a cone is given by:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone. The function `func_1(radius, height)` indeed uses this formula with the parameters `radius` and `height` being the expected inputs. 

The assertions provided test the function with several valid inputs and check if the outputs are close to the expected values, demonstrating that the function performs correctly for the tested cases. Since the problem description states that the function must compute the volume of a cone and the function does exactly that, the implementation meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and satisfies the description, leading to the conclusion that the correctness of the program is True.
