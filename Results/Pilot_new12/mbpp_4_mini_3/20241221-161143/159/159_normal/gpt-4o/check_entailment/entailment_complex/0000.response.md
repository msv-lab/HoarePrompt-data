Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to calculate the volume of a cone. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are intended to be positive numbers. It uses the formula for the volume of a cone, \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

Here's the breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Volume Calculation**: The formula implemented in the function is mathematically accurate according to the geometric formula for calculating the volume of a cone.
2. **Parameter Requirements**: The function assumes valid input (positive numbers), which aligns with the description stating that the function should compute the volume when provided with a valid radius and height.
3. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided indicate that the function has been tested with sample inputs, and the expected outputs match the calculated results.

While it is noted that the function does not handle cases where the inputs are negative or zero, the assumption that the inputs will always be valid is stated clearly in the task's guidelines. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the function's implementation, it correctly meets the requirement to find the volume of a cone under the assumption of valid input.
