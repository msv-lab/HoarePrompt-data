#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are positive numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are positive numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are intended to be positive numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. If the inputs are negative or zero, the function will not handle these edge cases gracefully; it assumes that both inputs are valid (positive). Thus, while it accurately computes the volume for valid input, the lack of input validation leaves the function vulnerable to erroneous usage.
