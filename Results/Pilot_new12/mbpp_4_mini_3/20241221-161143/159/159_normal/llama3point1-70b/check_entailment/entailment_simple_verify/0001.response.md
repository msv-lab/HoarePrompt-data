Final: **True**

The program implements the volume calculation of a cone correctly according to the given formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly applies this formula and handles valid inputs, which are non-negative real numbers as stated in the annotated code.

The annotated version confirms the state of the program before the function call, emphasizing that both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers and that the resulting volume is calculated accurately. The annotations align well with the problem description and the rationale provided during the original assessment.

Therefore, since the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description, and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
