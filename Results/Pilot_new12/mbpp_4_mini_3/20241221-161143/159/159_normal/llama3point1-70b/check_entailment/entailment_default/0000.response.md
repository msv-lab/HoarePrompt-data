Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code does not handle the case when either `radius` or `height` is negative. According to the problem description, both `radius` and `height` are expected to be non-negative real numbers when calculating the volume of a cone. If a negative value is provided, the formula will still compute a value but it may yield an incorrect (negative) volume, which contradicts the expected behavior of the function. Thus, the function fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases, leading to its incorrectness.
