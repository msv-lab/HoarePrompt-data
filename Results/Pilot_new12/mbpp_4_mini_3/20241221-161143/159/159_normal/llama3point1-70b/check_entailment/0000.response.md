Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, given by \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The function uses `math.pi` to incorporate the value of \(\pi\) accurately, and it computes the volume based on the provided `radius` and `height`.

As all cases, including potential edge cases (like zero or positive values for radius and height), are handled correctly, I cannot find an input case where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem description completely.
