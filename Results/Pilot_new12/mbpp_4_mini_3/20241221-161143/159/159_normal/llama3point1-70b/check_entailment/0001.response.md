Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

Where:
- \( V \) is the volume of the cone.
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone.
- \( h \) is the height of the cone.

The function `func_1(radius, height)` takes two parameters (`radius` and `height`) and applies the formula properly using Python's `math.pi` for the value of Ï€. 

To ensure its correctness, let's consider edge cases:
1. When both `radius` and `height` are positive numbers (e.g., `func_1(3, 5)` should return a positive volume).
2. If either `radius` or `height` is zero (e.g., `func_1(0, 5)` or `func_1(3, 0)` should return 0, as the volume of a cone with zero height or radius is zero).
3. If both arguments are negative, it's typical in volume calculations to treat such cases as invalid as a cone cannot have negative dimensions. However, mathematically the program will still compute a volume (albeit a non-physical one).

Since the program performs correctly for all valid cases it handles (positive and zero dimensions), and no case was found that the code fails to comply with the problem description, the program is correct.

Thus, the conclusion is that this program meets the requirements for calculating the volume of a cone.
