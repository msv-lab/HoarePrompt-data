Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are stated to be non-negative real numbers. The implementation uses the `math.pi` constant for Ï€, ensuring precision in the calculation.

Given these points, the function will correctly compute the cone's volume for any valid non-negative real inputs for radius and height, thereby meeting the requirements outlined in the problem description.
