Correctness: **False**

The program correctly implements the formula to calculate the volume of a cone, which is \((1/3) * \pi * radius^2 * height\). However, it does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` are negative, which can lead to incorrect results. According to the output hints, if either `radius` or `height` is negative, the function may return an invalid negative volume, thus failing to meet the problem description's requirement of handling only non-negative real numbers. 

For instance, if the function is called with `func_1(-5, 10)`, it would produce a negative volume, which is logically and mathematically incorrect. Therefore, since the program does not correctly validate inputs for all potential cases, the correctness is deemed false.
