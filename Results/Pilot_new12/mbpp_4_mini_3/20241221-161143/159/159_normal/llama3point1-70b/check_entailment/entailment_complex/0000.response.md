Correctness: **False**

The program does not adhere strictly to the problem description because it lacks input validation to ensure that both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. Although the annotations state that `radius` and `height` are expected to be non-negative, the function itself will not prevent or handle cases where the inputs provide negative values. In such cases, the function could return a negative volume, which is not valid in the context of calculating the volume of a cone. Therefore, since the implementation does not guarantee compliance with the requirements set forth in the problem description for all potential cases, the program is deemed incorrect.
