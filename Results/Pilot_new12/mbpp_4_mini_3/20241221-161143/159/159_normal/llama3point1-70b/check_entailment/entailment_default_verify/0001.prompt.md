You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

Where:
- \( V \) is the volume of the cone.
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone.
- \( h \) is the height of the cone.

The function `func_1(radius, height)` takes two parameters (`radius` and `height`) and applies the formula properly using Python's `math.pi` for the value of π. 

To ensure its correctness, let's consider edge cases:
1. When both `radius` and `height` are positive numbers (e.g., `func_1(3, 5)` should return a positive volume).
2. If either `radius` or `height` is zero (e.g., `func_1(0, 5)` or `func_1(3, 0)` should return 0, as the volume of a cone with zero height or radius is zero).
3. If both arguments are negative, it's typical in volume calculations to treat such cases as invalid as a cone cannot have negative dimensions. However, mathematically the program will still compute a volume (albeit a non-physical one).

Since the program performs correctly for all valid cases it handles (positive and zero dimensions), and no case was found that the code fails to comply with the problem description, the program is correct.

Thus, the conclusion is that this program meets the requirements for calculating the volume of a cone.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are expected to be non-negative real numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. If either `radius` or `height` is negative, this function may behave unexpectedly or incorrectly return a negative volume, as the function does not implement input validation to enforce non-negativity. In a full implementation, it would be advisable to check that both parameters are non-negative before performing the calculation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
