The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are expected to be non-negative real numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. If either `radius` or `height` is negative, this function may behave unexpectedly or incorrectly return a negative volume, as the function does not implement input validation to enforce non-negativity. In a full implementation, it would be advisable to check that both parameters are non-negative before performing the calculation.
