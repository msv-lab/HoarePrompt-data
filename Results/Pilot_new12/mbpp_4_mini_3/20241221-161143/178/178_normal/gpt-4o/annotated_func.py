#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the product of total_sum and the length of the list numbers, where total_sum is the sum of the rounded values in rounded_numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter, `numbers`, which is a list of numerical values (either integers or floats). It processes this list by rounding each number to the nearest integer and computes the total sum of these rounded values. The function then calculates the product of this total sum and the length of the original list of numbers. The final result is returned, which is a numerical value representing this product. Edge cases like empty input lists are implicitly handled, resulting in a return value of 0 since the length of an empty list is 0 and would lead to a product of total_sum (which would also be 0 in this scenario) and 0. However, the function does not explicitly manage or signal any errors for invalid input types (e.g., if `numbers` contains non-numerical values).
