The code creates a new list `rounded_numbers` by rounding each element in `numbers`. Since `numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats), the elements in `rounded_numbers` will be the rounded values of the corresponding elements in `numbers`. The variable `numbers` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats); `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of the elements in `numbers`.**
