The `result` is assigned the value of `total_sum` multiplied by the length of `numbers`. The `total_sum` represents the sum of the rounded values in `rounded_numbers`, and `len(numbers)` gives the count of elements in the `numbers` list. The states of the `numbers` and `rounded_numbers` variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats); `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of the elements in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of the rounded values in `rounded_numbers`; `result` is equal to `total_sum * len(numbers)`**.
