The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `rounded_numbers`. Since `rounded_numbers` contains the rounded values of the elements in `numbers`, `total_sum` will be the total of these rounded values. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats); `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of the elements in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of the rounded values in `rounded_numbers`.**
