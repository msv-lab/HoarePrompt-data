The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of numbers that can include both integers and floats. The function computes the sum of the rounded values of these numbers (referred to as `total_sum`) and multiplies this sum by the length of the list `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numbers and return the product of the sum of the rounded values of these numbers and the length of the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, which is a list of numbers, and returns the product of the sum of the rounded values of the numbers and the length of the list.**
