You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the requirements specified in the problem description and compare them with the implementation in the code.

### Problem Description:
Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.

### Program Analysis:
The function is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]  # Rounds each number in the list.
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)                     # Sums the rounded numbers.
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)                    # Multiplies the total sum by the length of the list.
    return result                                         # Returns the result.
```

### Testing Edge Cases:
The three provided assertions check the function with specific inputs:

1. `func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5])` is asserted to be equal to 243.
2. `func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29])` is asserted to be equal to 345.
3. `func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2])` is asserted to be equal to 513.

To verify whether the implementation works with these inputs, we can compute the expected outputs manually.

#### Test Case Computations:
1. For the first input:
   - Rounded numbers: `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`
   - Total sum: `22 + 4 - 16 - 9 + 11 - 12 + 14 - 5 + 18 = 7`
   - Length: `9`
   - Result: `7 * 9 = 63` (not equal to 243).

2. For the second input:
   - Rounded numbers: `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]`
   - Total sum: `5 + 2 + 9 + 24 + 29 = 69`
   - Length: `5`
   - Result: `69 * 5 = 345` (correct).

3. For the third input:
   - Rounded numbers: `[25, 57, 89]`
   - Total sum: `25 + 57 + 89 = 171`
   - Length: `3`
   - Result: `171 * 3 = 513` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The implementation fails for the first test case since the expected value is 243, but the actual computation results in 63. Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description for at least this specific input case.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single parameter, `numbers`, which is a list of numerical values (either integers or floats). It processes this list by rounding each number to the nearest integer and computes the total sum of these rounded values. The function then calculates the product of this total sum and the length of the original list of numbers. The final result is returned, which is a numerical value representing this product. Edge cases like empty input lists are implicitly handled, resulting in a return value of 0 since the length of an empty list is 0 and would lead to a product of total_sum (which would also be 0 in this scenario) and 0. However, the function does not explicitly manage or signal any errors for invalid input types (e.g., if `numbers` contains non-numerical values).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
