Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` accurately follows the problem description, which requires the function to round every number in a given list and then compute the total sum of these rounded numbers, multiplied by the length of the list.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Rounding Each Number**: The line `rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]` takes each number from the input list `numbers` and rounds it to the nearest integer, fulfilling the requirement of rounding the values.

2. **Calculating the Total Sum**: The function then computes the total of these rounded values using `total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)`. This step correctly aggregates the rounded numbers as specified in the problem description.

3. **Multiplying by the Length of the List**: Finally, the program calculates the product of `total_sum` and the length of the input list with `result = total_sum * len(numbers)`, which satisfies the last part of the requirement.

4. **Correct Return Value**: The function returns this computed value, which matches the expected output specified in the assertions.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: As noted in the annotations, the function implicitly handles the case of an empty list by returning 0 (since the length of the list would be 0), which is consistent with the requirements.

Therefore, since the function adheres to the full problem requirements and behaves as expected across various scenarios (including edge cases), the correctness is affirmed.
