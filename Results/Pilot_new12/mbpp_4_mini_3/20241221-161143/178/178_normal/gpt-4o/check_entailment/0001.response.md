To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the requirements specified in the problem description and compare them with the implementation in the code.

### Problem Description:
Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.

### Program Analysis:
The function is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]  # Rounds each number in the list.
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)                     # Sums the rounded numbers.
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)                    # Multiplies the total sum by the length of the list.
    return result                                         # Returns the result.
```

### Testing Edge Cases:
The three provided assertions check the function with specific inputs:

1. `func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5])` is asserted to be equal to 243.
2. `func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29])` is asserted to be equal to 345.
3. `func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2])` is asserted to be equal to 513.

To verify whether the implementation works with these inputs, we can compute the expected outputs manually.

#### Test Case Computations:
1. For the first input:
   - Rounded numbers: `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`
   - Total sum: `22 + 4 - 16 - 9 + 11 - 12 + 14 - 5 + 18 = 7`
   - Length: `9`
   - Result: `7 * 9 = 63` (not equal to 243).

2. For the second input:
   - Rounded numbers: `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]`
   - Total sum: `5 + 2 + 9 + 24 + 29 = 69`
   - Length: `5`
   - Result: `69 * 5 = 345` (correct).

3. For the third input:
   - Rounded numbers: `[25, 57, 89]`
   - Total sum: `25 + 57 + 89 = 171`
   - Length: `3`
   - Result: `171 * 3 = 513` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The implementation fails for the first test case since the expected value is 243, but the actual computation results in 63. Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description for at least this specific input case.

Correctness: **False**
