The provided program does indeed follow the problem description and performs its intended functionality correctly for all described cases. 

1. The program rounds each number in the given list using the built-in `round()` function.
2. It then computes the total sum of these rounded numbers.
3. Finally, it multiplies this total sum by the length of the original list of numbers.

The output hints indicate that the function handles edge cases like an empty list by returning 0, which is consistent with the problem description. The assumption made is that the input will always be a valid list of numerical values, which further supports the correctness of the function.

No apparent case exists where the function would misbehave or not return the correct output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program can be concluded to be correct.

Correctness: **True**.
