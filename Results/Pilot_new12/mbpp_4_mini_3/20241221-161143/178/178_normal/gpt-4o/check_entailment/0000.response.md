Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the specified functionality as described. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of the rounded numbers and then multiplies that sum by the length of the original list. 

However, the expected functionality according to the problem description is ambiguous regarding whether to multiply the rounded sum or the actual sum of the list. 

For example, consider the input:
```python
func_1([-0.4, 0.5])
```
According to the implementation, rounding these numbers yields `0` and `0`, resulting in a rounded_sum of `0` and a length of `2`. So, the output will be `0 * 2 = 0`. The sum of the original list is `0.1`, and if we were to compute something else based on the original sum, we might arrive at a different expectation.

Thus, since the output difference here can lead to varying interpretations of "the total sum multiplied by the length of the list," the program could be considered incorrect based on how it interprets what is meant by "total sum." 

Therefore, it does not fully comply with the problem description as required.
