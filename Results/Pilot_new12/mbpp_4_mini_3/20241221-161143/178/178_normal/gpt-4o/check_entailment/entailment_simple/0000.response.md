Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of how it meets the criteria:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The function `func_1` iterates over the input list `numbers`, rounding each number using the `round()` function. This fulfills the requirement of rounding every number in the list.

2. **Calculating the Sum**: After rounding, the program computes the sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum()` function, storing this value in `total_sum`.

3. **Multiplying by the Length of the List**: The program then multiplies `total_sum` by the length of the original list `numbers` using `len(numbers)`, which is precisely what the problem description specifies.

4. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the result of the multiplication is returned as the output of the function.

The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the test cases given, and since we assume valid input (the expected format of a list of numbers), the function will handle any valid input correctly. Thus, the implementation adheres to the stated requirements of the problem description.
