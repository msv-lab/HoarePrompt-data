Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not consider the potential case of invalid input types within the list `numbers`. While the problem description states that it accepts a list of numerical values, there is no explicit handling for non-numerical values. If the input list contains non-numeric types (like strings or None), the program would raise a `TypeError` during the rounding or summing process. 

For instance, if we tested with an input like `func_1([1, 2, 'three', 4])`, it would result in an error instead of handling the case in a defined manner. Hence, this omission makes the program incorrect.
