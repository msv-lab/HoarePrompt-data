Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input list of numbers is empty. When the input list is empty, the length is `0`, and the multiplication of the total sum (which is also `0` in this case) by `0` would lead to a situation where the function should ideally handle this case gracefully, potentially returning `0` or some indication of no valid input. However, the current program would result in `0 * 0`, which is mathematically valid, but it doesn't fulfill the intention of rounding and summing non-empty lists. More critically, it does not conform to the essence of the problem description that doesn't specify the expected output for an empty list. Therefore, it lacks comprehensive handling for all inputs.
