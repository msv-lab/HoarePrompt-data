Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. 

1. It takes a list of numbers (which can be either integers or floats).
2. It rounds each number in the list using the `round()` function.
3. It calculates the sum of these rounded numbers using the `sum()` function.
4. Finally, it multiplies this total sum by the length of the input list and returns the result.

The program meets the requirements of rounding every number in the list, calculating the total sum of the rounded numbers, and multiplying that sum by the length of the list, just as specified in the problem description. 

Additionally, since we assume valid input (a list of numbers), there are no potential issues or edge cases that the function needs to handle, confirming the correctness of the implementation as per the described specifications.
