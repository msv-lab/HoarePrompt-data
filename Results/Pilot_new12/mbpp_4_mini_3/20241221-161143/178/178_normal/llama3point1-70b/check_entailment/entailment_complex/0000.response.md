Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements described in the problem description. According to the annotated program, if the input list `numbers` is empty, the function will attempt to compute `len(numbers)`, which will be zero. As a result, the program would return `0` because the total sum calculated from an empty list will also be `0`. 

The problem description states to "print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list," but it doesn't specify that an empty list should lead to a return value of zero. In contrast, a more reasonable interpretation would be that the function should return a value based on the expectations from the sum of the list or some indication that the list is empty.

Therefore, the function's handling of an empty list is not aligned with what the problem description suggests, leading to the conclusion that it does not fulfill the specified requirements correctly in all scenarios.
