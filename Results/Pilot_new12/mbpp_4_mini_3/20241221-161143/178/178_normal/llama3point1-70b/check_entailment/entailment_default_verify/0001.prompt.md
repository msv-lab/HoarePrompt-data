You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program rounds each number in the given list, sums the rounded values, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list, which aligns with the problem description. 

Here’s a breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Rounding Each Number**: The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` effectively rounds each of the numbers in the input list.
  
2. **Calculating the Total Sum**: The `sum(rounded_numbers)` computes the total of the rounded integers.

3. **Multiplying by the Length**: The multiplication `total_sum * len(numbers)` then takes the total sum of the rounded numbers and multiplies it by the length of the original input list.

This implementation correctly handles different scenarios:
- If the input list is empty, the return value will be 0 since the length will be 0, which appropriately reflects the scenario of an empty input.
- If numbers are negative, positive, or zero, they will be rounded according to Python’s rounding rules, and summed accordingly.

Since the program behaves as required in every situation considered, it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of real numbers (which can be integers or floats) as input. It rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer, then computes the sum of these rounded integers. Finally, it multiplies the sum by the total count of numbers in the original list and returns this product. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty; thus attempting to call the function with an empty list would result in a multiplication with zero (due to the length being zero), leading to a return value of zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
