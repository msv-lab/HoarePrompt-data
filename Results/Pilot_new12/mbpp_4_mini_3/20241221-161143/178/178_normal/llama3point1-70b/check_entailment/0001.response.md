Correctness: **True**

The provided program rounds each number in the given list, sums the rounded values, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list, which aligns with the problem description. 

Here’s a breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Rounding Each Number**: The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` effectively rounds each of the numbers in the input list.
  
2. **Calculating the Total Sum**: The `sum(rounded_numbers)` computes the total of the rounded integers.

3. **Multiplying by the Length**: The multiplication `total_sum * len(numbers)` then takes the total sum of the rounded numbers and multiplies it by the length of the original input list.

This implementation correctly handles different scenarios:
- If the input list is empty, the return value will be 0 since the length will be 0, which appropriately reflects the scenario of an empty input.
- If numbers are negative, positive, or zero, they will be rounded according to Python’s rounding rules, and summed accordingly.

Since the program behaves as required in every situation considered, it is correct.
