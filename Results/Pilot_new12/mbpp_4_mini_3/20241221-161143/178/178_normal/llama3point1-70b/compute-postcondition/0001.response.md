The variable `total_sum` is assigned the sum of the values present in the `rounded_numbers` list. The `rounded_numbers` list is derived from rounding each element in `numbers`, so the values in `rounded_numbers` would depend on the elements of `numbers`. The `numbers` list does not change. Therefore, the output state reflects that `total_sum` now holds the sum of the integers in `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of real numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers obtained by rounding each element in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of `rounded_numbers`.**
