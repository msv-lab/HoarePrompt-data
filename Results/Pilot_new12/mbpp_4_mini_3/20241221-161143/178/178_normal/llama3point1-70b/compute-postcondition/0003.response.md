The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of real numbers (integers or floats). After executing the function body, it calculates `total_sum`, which is the sum of the rounded values of each number in the list, and also the length of `numbers`, which is the count of real numbers in the list. The function returns the product of `total_sum` and the length of `numbers`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of real numbers `numbers` and return the product of the total sum of the rounded numbers and the number of elements in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, and returns the product of the sum of the rounded values of the list and the number of elements in that list.**
