The variable `rounded_numbers` is assigned a list, where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`. Since `numbers` is a list of real numbers (either integers or floats), the resulting list `rounded_numbers` will contain the rounded integers of each real number in `numbers`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of real numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers obtained by rounding each element in `numbers`.**
