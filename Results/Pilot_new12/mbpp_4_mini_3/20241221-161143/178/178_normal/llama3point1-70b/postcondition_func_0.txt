The function accepts a list of real numbers (which can be integers or floats) as input. It rounds each number in the list to the nearest integer, then computes the sum of these rounded integers. Finally, it multiplies the sum by the total count of numbers in the original list and returns this product. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty; thus attempting to call the function with an empty list would result in a multiplication with zero (due to the length being zero), leading to a return value of zero.
