The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elem`. `tup` is a tuple, and `elem` is an element that can be of any type that may be present in `tup`. After executing the function body, it returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and return the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.**
