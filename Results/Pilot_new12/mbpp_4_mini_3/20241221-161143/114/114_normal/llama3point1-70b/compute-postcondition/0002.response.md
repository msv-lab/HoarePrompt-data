Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and it returns the count of occurrences of `elem` within the tuple `tup`. It accurately handles all cases, including instances where `elem` is not present in `tup`, in which case it will return zero. Additionally, if `tup` is empty, the function will also return zero, as there are no elements to count. The function does not modify the input parameters or perform any actions beyond counting the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.**
