Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `elem` (an element of any type that may be present in the tuple).

2. **Count Occurrences**: Inside the function, the method `tup.count(elem)` is used. This built-in method effectively counts the number of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`, which is precisely what the problem description specifies.

3. **Handling Various Cases**:
   - If `elem` is not present in `tup`, `tup.count(elem)` will safely return zero, which aligns with the expected behavior described.
   - If `tup` is empty, the method will also return zero, since there are no elements to count in an empty tuple.

4. **No Side Effects**: The function does not modify the input parameters or perform any actions other than counting occurrences, adhering to the expectation of the problem description.

Given this analysis, the function behaves correctly under all specified scenarios, meeting the criteria put forth in the problem description. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
