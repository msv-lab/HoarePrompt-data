Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple and an element, and it uses the `count` method of the tuple to determine the number of occurrences of the specified element within that tuple. This method will correctly handle all potential cases, including:

1. The element is present multiple times in the tuple.
2. The element is present once in the tuple.
3. The element is not present in the tuple.
4. The tuple is empty.
5. The element is of any data type that can be contained in a tuple (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).

Since I cannot find any examples of the code failing to perform its intended functionality as per the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
