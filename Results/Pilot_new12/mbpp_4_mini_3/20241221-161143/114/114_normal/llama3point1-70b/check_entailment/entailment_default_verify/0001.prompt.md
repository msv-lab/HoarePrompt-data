You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple and an element, and it uses the `count` method of the tuple to determine the number of occurrences of the specified element within that tuple. This method will correctly handle all potential cases, including:

1. The element is present multiple times in the tuple.
2. The element is present once in the tuple.
3. The element is not present in the tuple.
4. The tuple is empty.
5. The element is of any data type that can be contained in a tuple (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).

Since I cannot find any examples of the code failing to perform its intended functionality as per the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and it returns the count of occurrences of `elem` within the tuple `tup`. It accurately handles all cases, including instances where `elem` is not present in `tup`, in which case it will return zero. Additionally, if `tup` is empty, the function will also return zero, as there are no elements to count. The function does not modify the input parameters or perform any actions beyond counting the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
