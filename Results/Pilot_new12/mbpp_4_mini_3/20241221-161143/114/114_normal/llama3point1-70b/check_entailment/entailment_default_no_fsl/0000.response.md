Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and it returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. 

The output hints confirm that the function handles cases where the element is not present in the tuple (returning zero) and also handles empty tuples appropriately (also returning zero). Since the function uses the built-in `.count()` method of tuples, it is guaranteed to operate correctly for all valid inputs according to the problem statement.

No edge cases were identified that the function fails to handle, affirming that the function behaves as expected in every potential scenario described.
