Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately follows the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to take two parameters: a tuple (`tup`) and an element (`elem`). It correctly utilizes the built-in `count` method of the tuple to determine the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

The key points demonstrating the correctness of the program are:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function accepts a tuple and an element, aligning with the specifications of the problem description.
  
2. **Count Functionality**: The `count` method is specifically intended to return the number of times an element appears in a collection, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

3. **Return Value**: The function directly returns the result of `tup.count(elem)`, which is the count of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple, fulfilling the requirement.

4. **Assumptions on Input Validity**: As per the guidelines, we can assume that the inputs will always be valid (a tuple for `tup`, and an element of any type for `elem`), hence no additional error handling is necessary.

Since the function performs the intended operation as described, it is correct.
