Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code provided functions correctly as per the problem description by using the built-in tuple method `count`, which accurately counts the occurrences of the specified element within the tuple. It handles all scenarios described in the output hints, including cases where the element is not present (returning zero) and when the tuple is empty (also returning zero). Since it meets the requirements for all potential input cases as specified, the program is correct.
