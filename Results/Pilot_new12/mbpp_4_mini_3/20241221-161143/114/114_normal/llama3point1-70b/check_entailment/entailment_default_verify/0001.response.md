Final: **True** 

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element, successfully using the `count` method to determine the occurrences of the specified element. The output hints support this assessment by confirming that the function handles all specified scenarios correctlyâ€”including counting occurrences, returning zero when the element is absent, and correctly handling empty tuples. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
