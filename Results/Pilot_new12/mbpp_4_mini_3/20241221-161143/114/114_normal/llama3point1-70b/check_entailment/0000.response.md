Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The `count` method of a tuple in Python counts the occurrences of a specified element. Therefore, for any valid input tuple and element, the program will return the accurate count of how many times that element appears in the tuple. This includes various edge cases, such as:

1. Empty tuple: `func_1((), 1)` should return `0`.
2. Element not in tuple: `func_1((1, 2, 3), 4)` should return `0`.
3. Element appears multiple times: `func_1((1, 2, 1, 3, 1), 1)` should return `3`.
4. Tuple with mixed types: `func_1((1, 'a', 1, 'a'), 'a')` should return `2`.

Since the implementation handles all these cases correctly and meets the problem's requirements, the program is correct in its current form.
