#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elem is an element that can be of any type that may be present in tup.
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)
    #The program returns the count of occurrences of 'elem' in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and it returns the count of occurrences of `elem` within the tuple `tup`. It accurately handles all cases, including instances where `elem` is not present in `tup`, in which case it will return zero. Additionally, if `tup` is empty, the function will also return zero, as there are no elements to count. The function does not modify the input parameters or perform any actions beyond counting the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.
