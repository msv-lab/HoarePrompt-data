The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `element`. `tup` is a tuple that can contain elements of any type, while `element` can also be of any type. After executing the function body, it returns the count of how many times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and return the number of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and returns the count of how many times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`.**
