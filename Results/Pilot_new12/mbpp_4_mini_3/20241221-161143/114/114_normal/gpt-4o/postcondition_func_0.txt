The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and returns an integer representing the count of how many times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`. Edge cases such as an empty tuple will return 0, and if the `element` is not found in the tuple, it will also return 0. The function does not handle or raise exceptions for non-tuple inputs, and any type of element can be counted as long as it can be found within the tuple.
