#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and element can be of any type.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the count of how many times 'element' appears in the tuple 'tup'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and returns an integer representing the count of how many times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`. Edge cases such as an empty tuple will return 0, and if the `element` is not found in the tuple, it will also return 0. The function does not handle or raise exceptions for non-tuple inputs, and any type of element can be counted as long as it can be found within the tuple.
