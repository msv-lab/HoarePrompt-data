Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly takes a tuple and an element, then returns the count of occurrences of that element within the tuple, which aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The annotations confirm the initial correctness assessment by clearly stating the expected behavior at different points in the code. The assertions provided are effectively tests that verify the function's correctness against varying inputs, and all tests pass as expected:

1. The count of `4` in the tuple returns `0`, which is correct.
2. The count of `10` returns `3`, confirming it appears thrice.
3. The count of `8` returns `4`, consistent with its occurrences in the tuple.

The annotations reinforce that the function operates as intended, with no edge cases or erroneous inputs being overlooked since it assumes valid input. Thus, the logic is sound, supporting the conclusion that the function meets the problem's requirements satisfactorily.
