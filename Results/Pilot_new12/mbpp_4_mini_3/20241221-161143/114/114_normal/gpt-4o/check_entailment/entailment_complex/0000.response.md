Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Type**: The function is designed to take a tuple (`tup`) and an `element` as its inputs. According to the problem description, it is acceptable for `element` to be of any type, which the function accommodates.

2. **Count Occurrences**: The main functionality of the function is to count the occurrences of the specified `element` in the `tup` tuple. The built-in method `count()` of the tuple is used, which directly implements the requirement to return the number of times `element` appears in `tup`.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns an integer, which aligns with the requirement that the output should represent the count of occurrences. If the element is not found in the tuple, `tuple.count()` will return 0, as expected.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as:
   - An empty tuple will return 0, since there are no elements to count.
   - If the `element` does not exist in the tuple, it also safely returns 0.

5. **Valid Input Assumption**: The documentation states that the function does not handle non-tuple inputs and that valid inputs are assumed. This aligns with the verification criteria that we should consider valid inputs as given.

Thus, the function performs exactly as described in the problem statement for any valid input, which confirms its correctness.
