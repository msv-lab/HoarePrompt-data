Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple and an element, and returns the count of occurrences of that element in the tuple using the `count` method of a tuple. This method works as intended for various test cases as shown in the assertions.

1. In the case of the first assertion, the element `4` does not exist in the tuple, so the returned count is `0`, which matches the expected output.
2. For the second assertion, the element `10` appears three times in the tuple and the function returns `3`, which is correct.
3. In the third assertion, the element `8` appears four times in the tuple and the function returns `4`, which is again correct.

The logic is sound, and since all test cases work correctly without any edge cases that are not handled, the function meets the problem's requirements. Thus, no potential input cases were identified where the function fails or is incomplete. Hence, the correctness is confirmed.
