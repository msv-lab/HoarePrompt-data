Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements the required behavior to count occurrences of a specified element in a tuple. The provided annotations confirm the functionality:

1. The first assertion checks for the element `4`, which is not present in the tuple, and as expected, the function returns `0`.
2. The second assertion correctly verifies that the element `10` appears `3` times in the tuple.
3. The third assertion correctly confirms that the element `8` appears `4` times.

The annotations consistently support the workings of the assertions and the function. The function utilizes the built-in `count` method of tuples, which is appropriate and efficient for this task. Moreover, the assumption that valid inputs will always be provided ensures that edge cases (like invalid types or empty tuples) do not affect the assessment of correctness.

Given these considerations, the program meets the problem description, and thus, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
