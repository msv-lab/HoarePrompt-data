Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the function to count occurrences of a specified element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. The assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected for multiple test cases:

1. For the first assertion, the element `4` is not in the tuple, and the result is correctly `0`.
2. For the second assertion, the element `10` appears `3` times in the tuple, which is also accurately reported.
3. Lastly, for the third assertion, the element `8` appears `4` times in the tuple, which is correct.

Since the implementation handles these scenarios, and the logic is sound for counting occurrences in the tuple, I cannot find any potential case where it doesn't work as per the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
