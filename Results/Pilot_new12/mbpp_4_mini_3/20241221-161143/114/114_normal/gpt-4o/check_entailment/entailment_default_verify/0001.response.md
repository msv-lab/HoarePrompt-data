Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. It successfully counts the occurrences of the specified `element` within the given tuple `tup`. The assertions provided in the program validate that the function behaves as expected for different input scenarios, including cases where the `element` is not present in the tuple and cases where it appears multiple times.

The output hints reinforce this assessment by confirming that the function handles edge cases appropriately, returning `0` for both an empty tuple and cases where the element is absent. While it is noted that the function does not raise exceptions for non-tuple inputs, the prompt states that valid input will always be provided, which aligns with typical expectations for function behavior within defined constraints.

Thus, the program meets the problem description's criteria, and the correctness confirmed in the original assessment stands.
