Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle or raise exceptions for non-tuple inputs, which is a potential edge case according to the problem description. While the provided function works correctly for tuples containing elements of any type and counts occurrences accurately, it does not handle cases where the input is not a tuple. For instance, if the input were a list or a string instead of a tuple, the function would still attempt to call `count`, which would lead to incorrect behavior or errors. Therefore, since the function does not meet the problem description for every potential case, it is deemed incorrect.
