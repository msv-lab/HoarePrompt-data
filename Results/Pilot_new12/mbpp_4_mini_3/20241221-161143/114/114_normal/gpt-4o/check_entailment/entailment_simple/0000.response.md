Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the specified functionality of counting the occurrences of an element within a tuple. The `func_1` function takes in a tuple and an element as arguments and uses the `count` method of the tuple, which precisely returns the number of times that element appears in the tuple. 

The assertions provided in the annotated program validate various scenarios:
- Counting an element that does not exist in the tuple (element `4`), which correctly returns `0`.
- Counting an element that exists multiple times (element `10`), which correctly returns `3`.
- Counting another element with several occurrences (element `8`), which correctly returns `4`.

All cases align with the problem description, confirming that the function meets the requirements for any valid input. Thus, the implementation adheres to the problem description, fulfilling its requirement for counting occurrences of an element in a tuple.
