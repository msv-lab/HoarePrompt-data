You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4) == 0
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10) == 3
assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8) == 4

def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple and an element, and returns the count of occurrences of that element in the tuple using the `count` method of a tuple. This method works as intended for various test cases as shown in the assertions.

1. In the case of the first assertion, the element `4` does not exist in the tuple, so the returned count is `0`, which matches the expected output.
2. For the second assertion, the element `10` appears three times in the tuple and the function returns `3`, which is correct.
3. In the third assertion, the element `8` appears four times in the tuple and the function returns `4`, which is again correct.

The logic is sound, and since all test cases work correctly without any edge cases that are not handled, the function meets the problem's requirements. Thus, no potential input cases were identified where the function fails or is incomplete. Hence, the correctness is confirmed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and returns an integer representing the count of how many times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`. Edge cases such as an empty tuple will return 0, and if the `element` is not found in the tuple, it will also return 0. The function does not handle or raise exceptions for non-tuple inputs, and any type of element can be counted as long as it can be found within the tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
