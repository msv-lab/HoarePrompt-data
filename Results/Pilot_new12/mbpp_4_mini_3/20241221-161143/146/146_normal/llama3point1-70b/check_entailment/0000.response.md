Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to return a list of all sublists with the maximum length. However, the code only returns the first sublist that has the maximum length instead. 

For example, given the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`, the expected output should be `(max_len, [[6, 7, 8, 9]])`, but the program returns `(max_len, [6, 7, 8, 9])`, which does not respect the requirement of returning all maximum length sublists, only returning a single one. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the problem description fully.
