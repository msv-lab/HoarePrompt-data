The provided code attempts to find the longest sublist in a list of lists and returns the maximum length along with the first longest sublist. However, it does not handle the scenario where the input list is empty.

According to the problem description, if the list of lists is empty, the function should either return a meaningful output or handle the case gracefully. Since the function raises a `ValueError` when attempting to determine the maximum length from an empty list, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Moreover, the output hints clarify that the function can raise an exception when called with an empty input, further confirming that it does not handle the edge case correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
