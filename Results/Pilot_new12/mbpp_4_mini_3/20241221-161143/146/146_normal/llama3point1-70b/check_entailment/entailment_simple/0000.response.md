Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that finds the list(s) of maximum length within a list of lists. 

Here are the issues with the program:
1. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple consisting of the maximum length (`max_len`) and only the first sublist that matches that maximum length (`max_sublists[0]`). However, the problem description requires a list of all sublists that are of maximum length, not just the first one.
2. **Incomplete Logic**: The program should return all sublists that have the maximum length rather than just one (the first one).

To fix the issue, the program should return `max_sublists` instead of `max_sublists[0]` to correctly provide all sublists that are of maximum length, thus adhering to the problem description. Therefore, the program's logic does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem statement.
