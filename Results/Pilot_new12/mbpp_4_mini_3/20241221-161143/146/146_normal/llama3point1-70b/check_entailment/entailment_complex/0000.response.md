Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should find the list(s) of maximum length in a list of lists and return them. However, the implementation has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Return Values**: The function returns `max_len` and `max_sublists[0]`, which means it only returns the first sublist that has the maximum length, instead of returning a list of all such sublists. The problem description explicitly states that the function should return the list of maximum lengths, which implies that if there are multiple sublists of maximum length, they should all be returned.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although it is mentioned that the input is valid and will not cause any errors, the function does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. The Python `max()` function will raise a `ValueError` if called on an empty sequence, which is problematic even though the assumption is that the input will always be valid. 

Thus, the implementation fails to meet the problem description by returning only one of potentially many maximum length sublists instead of a list of all maximum length sublists. Therefore, the program does not adhere to the expected output as stipulated in the problem description.
