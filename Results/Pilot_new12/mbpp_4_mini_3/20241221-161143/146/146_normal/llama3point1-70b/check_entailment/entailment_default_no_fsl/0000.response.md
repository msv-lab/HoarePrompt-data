Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input list, `list_of_lists`, is empty. According to the problem description, the function is expected to find the longest sublist within the input list of lists. However, if `list_of_lists` is empty, calling `max()` on an empty sequence will raise a `ValueError`, which is an unhandled edge case. 

For instance, if we call `func_1([])`, the program will raise an error instead of returning valid output. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for all potential cases, particularly for the edge case of an empty input list.
