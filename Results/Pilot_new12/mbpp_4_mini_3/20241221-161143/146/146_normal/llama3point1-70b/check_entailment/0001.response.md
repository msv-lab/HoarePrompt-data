Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the description asks for a function that finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists. However, the implementation returns only the first sublist with the maximum length, rather than all sublists that have the maximum length.

For example, consider the input:

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]
```

The correct output should be the maximum sublist length with all sublists of that maximum length, which are `[[3, 4, 5]]`. However, the implementation will return `(3, [3, 4, 5])`, which yields only one of the lists instead of the full set.

Another example:

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9]]
```

The output should include all sublists that have the maximum length of `3`. Instead, the program will return only the first one it encounters, not fulfilling the requirement to list all of them.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem as specified and incorrectly assumes it should only return the first maximum-length sublist. This indicates that the program is incorrect.
