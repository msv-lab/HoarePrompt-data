The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** because the program does not return all sublists of maximum length, but only the first one. The output hints support this assessment by explicitly stating that the function returns the first sublist that has the maximum length. Furthermore, the hints indicate that in the case of an empty input list, the program will raise a `ValueError`, which suggests that the function does not handle all possible inputs gracefully.

The problem description clearly states the requirement as finding and returning a list of all sublists of maximum length, not just one sublist. Since the provided code only returns the first of those sublists as a tuple combined with the maximum length, it fails to fulfill the primary requirement of the task.

Additionally, the output hints mention that the function will raise an error for an empty list, which is another indication that the function does not handle inputs as expected. Thus, both in terms of the core functionality (not returning all sublists) and robustness (not handling an empty input), the program does not meet the problem's requirements.

Therefore, I agree with the original assessment that the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
