The variable `max_len` is assigned the value, which is the maximum length of the sublists contained within `list_of_lists`. Since the initial state defines `list_of_lists` as a list containing sublists of varying lengths, `max_len` will hold the length of the longest sublist. Other variables remain unaffected by this statement. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths, `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist.**
