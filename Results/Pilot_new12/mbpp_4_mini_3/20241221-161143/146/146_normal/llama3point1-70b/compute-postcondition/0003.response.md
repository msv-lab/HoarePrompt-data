The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying lengths. After executing the function body, it returns `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist, and `max_sublists[0]`, which is the first sublist from `max_sublists` that has length equal to `max_len`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sublists and return the length of the longest sublist along with the first sublist that has this maximum length.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists and returns the length of the longest sublist and the first sublist that has that maximum length.**
