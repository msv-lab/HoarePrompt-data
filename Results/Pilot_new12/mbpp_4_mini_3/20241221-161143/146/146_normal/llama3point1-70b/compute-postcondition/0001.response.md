The code creates a new list `max_sublists` that contains only those sublists from `list_of_lists` that have a length equal to `max_len`. The previous values of `list_of_lists` and `max_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the creation of `max_sublists` while retaining the existing states of the other variables.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths, `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist, `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` that have length equal to `max_len`.**
