#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying lengths.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns max_len, which is the length of the longest sublist, and max_sublists[0], which is the first sublist from `max_sublists` that has length equal to max_len.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists called `list_of_lists` and determines the length of the longest sublist within it. It returns two values: the maximum length found (`max_len`) and the first sublist (`max_sublists[0]`) that has that maximum length. However, if `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to attempting to take the maximum length of an empty sequence. This edge case is not handled in the provided code, which could lead to an error if no sublists are present.
