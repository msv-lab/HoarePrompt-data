The function accepts a list of lists called `list_of_lists` and determines the length of the longest sublist within it. It returns two values: the maximum length found (`max_len`) and the first sublist (`max_sublists[0]`) that has that maximum length. However, if `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to attempting to take the maximum length of an empty sequence. This edge case is not handled in the provided code, which could lead to an error if no sublists are present.
