The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists of varying lengths. It iterates over each sublist to determine the longest one within `list_of_lists`. After examining all sublists, it returns two values: `max_len`, the length of the longest sublist, and `max_list`, the longest sublist itself. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return `0` for `max_len` and an empty list for `max_list`. The function does not handle any specific types of elements within the sublists, allowing for a mix of data types.
