According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist, the loop will execute. Currently, `max_len` is 0, and `max_list` is an empty list, which do not influence the execution of the loop. To ensure that the loop executes, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 sublist. Therefore, we can establish the following needed states.

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 sublist, and `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**.
