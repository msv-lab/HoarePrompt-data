The variable `max_len` is assigned the value `len(lst)`, which calculates the length of the sublist `lst` taken from `list_of_lists`. Since `max_len` was initially 0, it will now hold the length of the sublist. The values of `max_list` and `list_of_lists` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_len` is `len(lst)`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 more sublist.

Output State: **`max_len` is `len(lst)`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 more sublist.**
