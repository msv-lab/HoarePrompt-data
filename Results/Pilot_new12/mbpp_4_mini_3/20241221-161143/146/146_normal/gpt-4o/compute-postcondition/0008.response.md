The value of `max_len` is assigned the length of `lst`, which is a sublist from `list_of_lists`. The previous value of `max_len` is 0, but after the assignment, it will be equal to the length of `lst`. The other variables, `max_list` and `list_of_lists`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, `lst` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
