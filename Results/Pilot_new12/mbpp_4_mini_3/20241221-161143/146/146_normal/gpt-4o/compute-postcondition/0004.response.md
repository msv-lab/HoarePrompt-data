The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of `len(lst)`. Given the initial state where `max_len` is 0 and `len(lst) > 0`, `max_len` will now hold the positive value of the length of `lst`. The states of `max_list` and `list_of_lists` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, which is greater than 0; `max_list` is an empty list; `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist; `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, which is greater than 0; `max_list` is an empty list; `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist; `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists.**
