The value of `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`, which is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `max_len` is the length of `lst`, and `max_list` is now equal to `lst`, the values of `max_len` and `max_list` are directly linked to the contents of `lst`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is the current sublist `lst`, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists.

Output State: **`max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is the current sublist `lst`, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists.**
