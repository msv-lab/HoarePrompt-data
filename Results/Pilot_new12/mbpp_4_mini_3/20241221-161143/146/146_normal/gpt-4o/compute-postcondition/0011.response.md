According to the code, for the loop to execute again, it depends on the `list_of_lists`. At the end of the last iteration, the `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, and the loop is iterating over each sublist. Since there has been at least one iteration already, we can assume that the loop has processed one of the sublists.

The variable `lst` represents the current sublist being processed in the iteration. If there were 2 sublists initially, after the first iteration of the loop, the loop will check the second sublist next. 

If we denote the number of iterations completed so far as `current_index`, we can update `max_len` and `max_list` if the current sublist (`lst`) has a length greater than `max_len`. Given that there are still sublists to process, `current_index` must be 1 (the first sublist has been processed), and for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more sublist left.

Thus, if `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, after processing one sublist there should still be at least 1 sublist left for the loop to continue.

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 more sublist.**
