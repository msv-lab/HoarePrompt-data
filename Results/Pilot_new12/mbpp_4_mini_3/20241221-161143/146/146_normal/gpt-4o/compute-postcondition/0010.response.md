Postcondition: ***`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, and `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists. If `len(lst)` is greater than `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst`, and `max_list` is set to the current sublist `lst`. Otherwise, `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
