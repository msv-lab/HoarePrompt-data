According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are further sublists in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist, it can execute at least once. After the last iteration, if `lst` was processed, it must have been one of the sublists in `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` may have been updated if the current sublist's length was greater than the previous `max_len`.

To prepare for the next iteration of the loop, `lst` will take on the next sublist from `list_of_lists`. If there is still at least one remaining sublist, the loop will continue. 

Given that `max_len` is currently 0, `max_list` is an empty list, and that there is at least one sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` may get updated if the next sublist has a length greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted based on the understanding that `lst` will be the next sublist in `list_of_lists` and `max_len` will only be updated if the length of this sublist is greater than the current `max_len`:

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, `lst` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`**
