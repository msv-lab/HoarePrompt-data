In the given code snippet, `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. The initial state specifies that `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)` and `max_list` is currently an empty list. After executing the code, `max_list` will now contain the elements from `lst` rather than being an empty list, but `max_len` remains equal to the length of the original `lst`. 

Output State: **`max_len` is `len(lst)`, `max_list` is `lst`**
