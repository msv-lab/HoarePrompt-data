The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can contain any type of elements. After executing the function body, it returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which is that longest sublist. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return the length and the content of the longest sublist. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns max_len (the length of the longest sublist) and max_list (the longest sublist itself).**
