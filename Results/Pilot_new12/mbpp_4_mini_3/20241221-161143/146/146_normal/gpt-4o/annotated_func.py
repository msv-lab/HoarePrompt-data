#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can contain any type of elements.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is that longest sublist, `list_of_lists` is a list of sublists.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns max_len, which is the length of the longest sublist in list_of_lists, and max_list, which is that longest sublist.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists of varying lengths. It iterates over each sublist to determine the longest one within `list_of_lists`. After examining all sublists, it returns two values: `max_len`, the length of the longest sublist, and `max_list`, the longest sublist itself. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return `0` for `max_len` and an empty list for `max_list`. The function does not handle any specific types of elements within the sublists, allowing for a mix of data types.
