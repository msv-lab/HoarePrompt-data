Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` does not account for the case when there are multiple lists of the maximum length. In such cases, the function always returns the first maximum-length list it encounters, rather than returning all lists that have the maximum length.

For instance, consider the input:

```python
func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
```

In this case, all lists have a length of 2. The function would return `(2, [1, 2])`, which only provides one of the lists with the maximum length instead of potentially providing all of them.

Thus, since the code does not handle the scenario of multiple maximum-length lists correctly, it is considered incorrect.
