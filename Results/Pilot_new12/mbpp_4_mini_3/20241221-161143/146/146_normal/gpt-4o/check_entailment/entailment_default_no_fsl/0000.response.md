Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the longest sublist from a list of lists. It works as follows:

- It initializes `max_len` to store the maximum length and `max_list` to store the longest sublist found.
- It iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and if the length of the current sublist is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and `max_list` accordingly.
- At the end, it returns a tuple containing the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself.

The code also handles the case where `list_of_lists` is empty, returning `(0, [])` correctly, which aligns with the problem description.  

All the assertions provided in the program are verified and yield the expected results, meaning the function behaves as required for those test cases. Since the criteria specified in the problem description are met, I can conclude that the code correctly finds the longest sublist in all specified scenarios. 

Thus, the program is correct for all potential cases as described in the prompt.
