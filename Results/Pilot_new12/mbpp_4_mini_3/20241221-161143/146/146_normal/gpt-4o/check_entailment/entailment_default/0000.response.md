The given Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates over a list of lists, checks the length of each sublist, and tracks the longest one encountered during the iteration. 

The output hints clearly indicate that the function will return the length of the longest sublist along with the longest sublist itself. The program also correctly handles the case where the `list_of_lists` is empty, returning `(0, [])` as expected, even though this case isn't explicitly tested in the assertions provided.

In particular, hereâ€™s a breakdown of the provided assertions:

1. `func_1([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])` returns `(3, [13, 15, 17])`, which correctly identifies the longest sublist.
2. `func_1([[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]])` returns `(4, [10, 12, 14, 15])`, correctly identifying the second longest sublist as well.
3. `func_1([[5], [15, 20, 25]])` returns `(3, [15, 20, 25])`, where it properly identifies the longest sublist.

Given these observations, the program meets all specified requirements and handles the potential edge case of an empty input list. Thus, for all possible valid inputs, including the edge case of an empty list, the function performs as intended.

Correctness: **True**.
