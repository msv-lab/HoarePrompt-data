Correctness: **False**.

The provided function does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple lists with the same maximum length. In the current implementation, it only retains the first list that reaches the maximum length. 

For example:
- If the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` have a length of 3, but the function would only return the last list it inspected which is `[7, 8]` because it only compares lengths and keeps the last list with a size greater than the previously found maximum list size.

Hence, this does not meet the requirement that specifies returning the list of maximum length, and also the accurate maximum length count. The output should correctly reflect the list with the maximum length and its length, but instead, it may not do so in all cases.
