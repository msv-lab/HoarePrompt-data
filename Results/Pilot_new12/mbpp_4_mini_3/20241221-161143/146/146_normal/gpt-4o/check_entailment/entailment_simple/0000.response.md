Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem states that the function should return the list of maximum length within a list of lists. However, the function `func_1` returns a tuple containing the length of that list and the list itself.

The expected outputs in the assertions suggest that the function should return a two-element tuple, where the first element is the length of the longest sublist, and the second element is the longest sublist. While this is somewhat aligned with the description, it could be misleading because the problem explicitly asks for "the list of maximum length" without explicitly mentioning the length as part of the return value.

The correct interpretation of "the list of maximum length" could imply that the function should simply return the longest sublist itself instead of a tuple containing its length. Therefore, the function's return type and structure do not entirely conform to the problem's intent.

There could also be situations where having the length included in the return value is unnecessary based on how the function could be used. For example, if a user merely wants to get the longest sublist, they would not need the corresponding length.

As such, because the implementation outputs a tuple instead of just the longest list, it fails to meet the problem description's intention of simply returning "the list of maximum length." Thus, I conclude that the provided program does not fulfill the problem statement accurately.
