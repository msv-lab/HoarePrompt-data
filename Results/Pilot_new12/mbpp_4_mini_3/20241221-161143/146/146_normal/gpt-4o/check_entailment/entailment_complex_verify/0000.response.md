Final: **False** 

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided program. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length. According to the problem description, the function should return the list of maximum length; however, the current implementation only retains the first sublist that reaches the maximum length due to the comparison logic used in the for loop. This means it fails to meet the expectation of returning the correct maximum length and sublist when ties occur, resulting in the incorrect outputs explained in the original assessment. The annotations do not mitigate this issue either, as they reaffirm the behavior of the function without addressing the behavior regarding ties. Therefore, the program's correctness is accurately assessed as **False**.
