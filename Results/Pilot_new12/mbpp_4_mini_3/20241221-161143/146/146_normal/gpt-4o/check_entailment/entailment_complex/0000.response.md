Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the output format of the function. According to the problem description, the function should return the list of maximum length found within the list of lists. However, the function `func_1` returns a tuple made up of the length of that list and the list itself, which deviates from the expected functionality of just finding and returning the longest list.

To comply with the problem description, the expected return should be just the sublist with the maximum length, not a tuple containing both the length and the sublist. 

For example, given the input `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, the expected return should be `[13, 15, 17]`, but the function returns the tuple `(3, [13, 15, 17])`. 

Thus, while the logic within the function does correctly identify the longest sublist, the output format does not align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is not correct.
