Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly address the scenario where multiple sublists can have the same maximum length. The function only returns the first encountered sublist of that maximum length instead of returning all such sublists. According to the problem description, the function should effectively find the longest lists, and since it fails to do so when multiple maximum-length lists exist, the function does not meet the specifications outlined in the problem. Thus, the conclusion of the original assessment that the program's correctness is **False** is justified.
