Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and counts the number of integer elements within that list. It does this efficiently using a generator expression that checks if each element `x` in the list is an instance of `int`, summing up the results (which will be either 1 for `True` or 0 for `False`).

Key points that affirm the correctness of the program in relation to the problem description are:

1. **Input Handling:** The function correctly assumes that the input will be a valid list, as specified in the problem description. It works seamlessly with both empty lists (returning 0) and lists that contain elements of various types, including integers.

2. **Output Specification:** The program returns a count of the integer elements, aligning with the requirement of providing the number of integers in the list. The use of the `sum()` function to aggregate the boolean results of the checks clearly meets the intended output format.

3. **Edge Cases:** The annotated description mentions that edge cases are handled, including an empty list or a list containing no integers, by returning a count of zero in those situations. This behavior is consistent with the problem description, as it accurately reflects the count of integers in any given list.

Overall, the function adheres to the task set forth in the problem description and provides the expected result for all possible valid inputs. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
