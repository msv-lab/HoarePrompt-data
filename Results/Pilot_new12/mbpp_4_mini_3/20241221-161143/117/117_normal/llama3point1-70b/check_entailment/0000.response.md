Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and counts the number of integer elements within it using the expression `sum((isinstance(x, int) for x in lst))`, which correctly evaluates whether each element `x` in `lst` is an instance of `int`. 

This function will correctly return the count of integers for any given list, including:
- A list with only integers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` should return `3`).
- An empty list (e.g., `[]` should return `0`).
- A list with mixed types (e.g., `[1, 'a', 3.0, 4]` should return `2`).
- A list with no integers at all (e.g., `['a', 'b', 3.0]` should return `0`).

Since I cannot find any input cases where the function fails to meet the problem description of counting integer elements, I conclude that the program is correct.
