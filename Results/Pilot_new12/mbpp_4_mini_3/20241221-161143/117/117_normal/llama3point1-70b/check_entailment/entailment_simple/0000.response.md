Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list `lst` as input and counts the number of elements in that list that are integers. 

Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. **Iterates through each element**: The program uses a generator expression `isinstance(x, int) for x in lst` to check each element in the list.
2. **Counts integers**: The `sum()` function adds up the boolean values returned by `isinstance`, where `True` (for integers) is counted as 1 and `False` (for non-integers) as 0.
3. **Returns the correct count**: The result is the total count of integer elements in the list, which is exactly what is required by the problem description.

Thus, since the program consistently provides the correct count of integer elements from any valid list as specified, it is correct.
