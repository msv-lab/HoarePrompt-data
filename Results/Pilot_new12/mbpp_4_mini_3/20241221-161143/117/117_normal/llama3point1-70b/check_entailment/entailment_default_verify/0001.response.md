Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the requirement of counting the integer elements within the provided list, as disclosed in the problem description. The function uses a generator expression to check each element in the list, correctly identifying the objects that are instances of `int`, and accurately computes the total count.

All the provided output hints reinforce this conclusion, noting that the function handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists without integers appropriately by returning a count of zero in those instances. Additionally, the hints affirm that the function does not alter the input list or count any data types other than integers. 

Overall, the implementation adheres to the specifications of the problem description, and the reasoning provided in the original assessment is sound given the evidence and output hints presented.
