Final: **True**

The original assessment stating the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly fulfills the problem description, which is to count the number of integer elements in a given list. The annotations confirm that the function simply evaluates whether each element is an instance of `int` and sums up the results, returning the appropriate count. The edge cases, such as empty lists or lists containing no integers, are correctly handled by returning a count of zero in those scenarios. Thus, all provided evidence supports that the program behaves as intended and meets the requirements stated in the problem description.
