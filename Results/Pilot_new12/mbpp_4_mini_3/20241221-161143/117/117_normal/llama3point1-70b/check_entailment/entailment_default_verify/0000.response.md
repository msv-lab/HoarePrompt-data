Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It counts the number of integer elements in a given list and handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists that contain no integers by returning a count of zero. The output hints further confirm that the function meets the requirements, as it explicitly states that the function counts and returns the number of integers in the list, and that it does not modify or filter the input list. Therefore, my conclusion aligns with the original assessment of correctness.
