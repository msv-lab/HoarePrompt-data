Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly counts and returns the number of integer elements in the provided list `lst`. The implementation uses a generator expression to check if each element `x` in the list is an instance of `int`, and then sums the results. This accurately adheres to the problem description of counting integer elements. 

Here are a few cases to demonstrate the correctness:

1. For the input `func_1([1, 2, 'three', 4.0])`, it returns 2, which is correct since there are two integers.
2. For the input `func_1([])`, it returns 0, which is correct since there are no elements in the list.
3. For the input `func_1([1, 2, 3])`, it returns 3, which is correct since all elements are integers.

No edge cases or scenarios have been identified where the function fails to provide the correct output based on the described requirements. Therefore, the function is confirmed to be correct in every potential case.
