#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that may include integers and other data types.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the count of how many elements in the list 'lst' are integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements that may include integers and other data types. It counts and returns the number of elements in the list that are integers. Potential edge cases such as an empty list or a list containing no integers are handled, returning a count of zero in those cases. The function does not filter or modify the input list in any way, and it does not consider other types in the count beyond integers.
