The program definition and the original assessment are evaluated against the provided problem description and annotations. The task is clearly stated: creating a function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.

The function `func_1(lst)` works by iterating over the elements in `lst` and using `isinstance(x, int)` to identify integers. The return value is the total number of such integers, which matches the requirement in the problem description.

The annotations confirm that:
1. At the invocation of the function, `lst` is a list that may contain a mix of data types, including integers.
2. The function correctly sums 1 for each integer found in the list.

The specific test cases provided in the assertions:
- For `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])`, it returns 2 (correct, as it counts 1 and 2).
- For `func_1([1, 2, 3])`, it returns 3 (correct, counting 1, 2, and 3).
- For `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])`, it returns 2 (correct, counting 1 and 4).

Moreover, the function does not filter for types other than `int`, nor does it handle cases such as empty lists. However, as stated in the assumption that the input will always be valid, this omission does not detract from the function's correctness regarding the problem description.

Given that the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and the annotations corroborate the behavior of the program correctly, I find the original assessment of correctness as **True** to be accurate.

Final: **True**
