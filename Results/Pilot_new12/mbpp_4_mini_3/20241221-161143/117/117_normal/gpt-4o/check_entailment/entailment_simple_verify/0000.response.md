Final: **True**

The program accurately meets the requirements of the problem description, which states that the function should return the number of integer elements in a given list. The annotations provided confirm that the function checks each element in the list to determine if it is an instance of `int` and sums up the counts correctly.

1. The function `func_1` is invoked with different test cases, and each case is consistent with the expected behavior stated in the problem description.
2. The annotation before the function confirms that `lst` contains various data types, and the function processes this correctly.
3. The evaluation of the test cases provided in the assertions yields the expected results, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

Furthermore, since the assumptions state that input will always be valid, additional edge cases such as empty input or invalid types do not alter the correctness of the function under the specified conditions. 

Overall, the original assessment claims the correctness as **True** which aligns with the detailed analysis of the problem description and the annotated behavior of the program. Thus, I maintain that the assessment is accurate and the program is correct.
