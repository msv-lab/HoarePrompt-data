The program provided correctly implements the logic to count the number of integer elements in a list. 

Here's the reasoning:
1. The function `func_1(lst)` accepts a list and iterates through each element.
2. It uses the `isinstance()` function to check if each element is of type `int`. 
3. It sums `1` for every element that is confirmed to be an integer.
4. The assertions provided cover several test cases, including integers mixed with strings and floats. The function produces the expected results for these cases, confirming its ability to accurately count integers.

Regarding the output hints, they state:
- The function does count integers and specifies that it does not filter non-integer types or specifically handle cases like empty lists.
- While it does not explicitly mention handling empty lists, the return value in such a case would correctly be `0`, since there are no elements to count.

Since there are no edge cases provided that cause the function to fail or produce an incorrect count, and all assertions check for valid integer counting, it seems the implementation correctly fulfills the problem requirements for every potential valid case.

Correctness: **True**.
