Final: **True** 

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully counts the number of integer elements in a list by using `isinstance` to determine if each element is of type `int`. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for a variety of test cases. 

The output hints confirm that the function correctly sums the integers, regardless of the presence of other data types in the list, and also indicate that the program does not need to handle non-integer data types or empty lists, as per the problem description's stipulation of valid input. Therefore, the reasoning supports that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description effectively.
