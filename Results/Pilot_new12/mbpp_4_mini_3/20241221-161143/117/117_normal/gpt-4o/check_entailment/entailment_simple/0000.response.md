Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to return the number of integer elements in a given list. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list `lst` as an input, which aligns with the problem description.
2. **Counting Integers**: The line `return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))` effectively counts the number of elements in the list that are instances of the `int` type by leveraging a generator expression. For each element `x` in `lst`, it checks if `x` is an integer. If true, it adds `1` to the sum.
3. **Expected Behavior**: The provided assertions test the function with various input cases including integers, strings, and floats, confirming that the function correctly identifies and counts only the integer elements.

Since the program behavior aligns with the problem description and the assertions confirm its functionality, it is deemed correct.
