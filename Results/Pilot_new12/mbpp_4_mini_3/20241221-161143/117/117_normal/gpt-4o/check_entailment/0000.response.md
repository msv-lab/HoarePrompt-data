Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` accurately counts the number of integer elements in the given list by using a generator expression within the `sum()` function. Each element in the list is checked with `isinstance(x, int)` which correctly identifies integers. 

To ensure correctness, we can analyze it using the provided cases:
1. `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` counts 2 integers (1 and 2).
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` counts 3 integers (1, 2, and 3).
3. `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` counts 2 integers (1 and 4).

Additionally, edge cases such as an empty list `func_1([])` would return 0, which is also correct. The implementation handles the requirements in the problem description correctly without missing any potential edge cases. Thus, I am confident that the program is correct for all possible inputs as specified.
