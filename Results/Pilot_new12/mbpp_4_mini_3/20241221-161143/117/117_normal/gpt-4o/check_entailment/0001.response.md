Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using the `isinstance` function to check if each element is an instance of `int`. The assertions provided also confirm that it behaves as expected for the test cases given in the problem description:

1. For the input `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])`, the integer elements are `1` and `2`, so it correctly returns `2`.
2. For the input `func_1([1, 2, 3])`, all three elements are integers, resulting in a correct return value of `3`.
3. For the input `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])`, the integer elements are `1` and `4`, leading to a correct return value of `2`.

All potential cases seem to be handled correctly and there are no edge cases missed regarding the integer type checking. Therefore, I can confirm that the program behaves as required by the problem description.
