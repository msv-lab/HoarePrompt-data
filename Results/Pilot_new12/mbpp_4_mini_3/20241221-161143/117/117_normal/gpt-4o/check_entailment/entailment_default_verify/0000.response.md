Final: **True** 

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to count the number of integer elements in a given list. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression with `isinstance(x, int)` to accurately identify and count integers. The original assessment of correctness is justified as the provided output hints confirm that the function iterates over all elements to determine the count of integers without any issues in handling non-integer types or an empty list, as it was assumed that valid input will always be provided. Overall, the function meets the specified requirements and handles all expected scenarios correctly.
