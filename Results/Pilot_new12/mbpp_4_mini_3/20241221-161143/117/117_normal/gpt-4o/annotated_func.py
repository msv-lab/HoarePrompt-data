#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list that may contain integers and other data types.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst' by summing 1 for each element that is an instance of 'int'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is a list that may contain integers and other data types. It returns the count of integers present in the list. This count is determined by iterating through each element in `lst` and summing 1 for every element that is an instance of the type `int`. The function does not handle any other types of data or provide any filtering for non-integer types, nor does it account for cases such as empty lists, but it correctly counts the number of integers regardless of other data types in the list.
