Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is a list that may contain integers and other data types. It returns the count of integers present in the list. This count is determined by iterating through each element in `lst` and summing 1 for every element that is an instance of the type `int`. The function does not handle any other types of data or provide any filtering for non-integer types, nor does it account for cases such as empty lists, but it correctly counts the number of integers regardless of other data types in the list.**
