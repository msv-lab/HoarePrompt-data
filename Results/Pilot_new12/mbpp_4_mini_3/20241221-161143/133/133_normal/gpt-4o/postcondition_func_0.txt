The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which must be of the same length and contain numerical elements. It returns a tuple that contains the differences of the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. The function will raise a `ValueError` if the two tuples are not of the same length, as this is a necessary requirement for the computation. If either tuple is empty, the function will return an empty tuple.
