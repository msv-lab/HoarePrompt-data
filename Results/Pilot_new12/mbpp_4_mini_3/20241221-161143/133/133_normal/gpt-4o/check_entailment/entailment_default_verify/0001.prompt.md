You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)

def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided function `func_1`, we analyze the problem description and the source code.

**Problem Description:**
The function needs to take two tuples and subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple at the same index.

**Provided Code:**
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

**Assertions:**
```python
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` uses `zip` to combine the two tuples, which creates pairs of elements: `(a, b)` where `a` is from `tup1` and `b` is from `tup2`.
2. It then calculates the difference `a - b` for each pair and constructs a new tuple with these results.

### Edge Cases:
- The function assumes both input tuples are of the same length, as it uses `zip`. If they are of different lengths, the `zip` function will truncate the longer tuple to the length of the shorter one, which may lead to unexpected behavior. For example:
  ```python
  func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))  # This would return (-2, -2), ignoring the value 5 from the second tuple.
  ```

- If one or both tuples are empty:
  ```python
  func_1((), ())  # This would return an empty tuple () as expected.
  func_1((1,), ())  # This would return (1,), not performing subtraction.
  func_1((), (2,))  # This would return an empty tuple (), not performing subtraction.
  ```

These cases indicate that the function does not adhere strictly to the problem description as it does not provide error handling or return meaningful results when the tuples differ in length.

### Conclusion:
Since we have identified a scenario (different length tuples) where the function does not perform as expected according to the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which must be of the same length and contain numerical elements. It returns a tuple that contains the differences of the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. The function will raise a `ValueError` if the two tuples are not of the same length, as this is a necessary requirement for the computation. If either tuple is empty, the function will return an empty tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
