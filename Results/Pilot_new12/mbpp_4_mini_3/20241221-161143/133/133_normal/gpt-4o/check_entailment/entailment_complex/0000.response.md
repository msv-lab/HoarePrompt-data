Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's how it adheres to those requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as parameters. According to the problem description, these tuples must be of the same length and contain numerical elements, which is implicitly guaranteed by the assertions provided in the annotations.

2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The program uses the `zip` function to iterate over the pairs of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. It computes the difference `a - b` for each pair of elements, where `a` comes from `tup1` and `b` comes from `tup2`. The use of a generator expression `tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))` ensures that the results are collected into a new tuple that represents the element-wise subtraction, consistent with the requirement.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns this new tuple, which contains the results of the subtraction, thereby meeting the output requirements specified in the problem description.

4. **Handling of Lengths**: Although it is not explicitly coded in the function, the function assumes that the inputs are valid as per the problem description. The assertion checks before the function calls confirm that the tuples are of the same length. It is noted that if they are not of the same length, a `ValueError` is expected to be raised, which confirms the correctness of the program flow with valid assumptions for input.

5. **Expected Output**: The provided assertions demonstrate the expected functionality of the function, showing various tuples and their expected results from the subtraction.

Since the program correctly implements the functionality of subtracting the elements of two tuples at the same indices and the assumptions about valid input are upheld through assertions, it fulfills the problem requirements.

Thus, the program is correct, and the output is:

Correctness: **True**
