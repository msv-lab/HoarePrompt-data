Explanation: The program aims to subtract the elements of two tuples and is implemented correctly. The function `func_1` uses zip to pair the elements of both tuples and subtracts the elements with the same index. The output hints indicate that the function will raise a `ValueError` if the tuples are of different lengths and will return an empty tuple if either tuple is empty. However, it is important to note that this specific check for empty tuples is not present in the implementation. Instead, if both tuples are empty, the function will correctly return an empty tuple since the zip function would yield no pairs, leading to an empty result. Also, since we assume the inputs will be valid (i.e., both tuples of the same length), there is no need for additional checks, and the program correctly meets the functional requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
