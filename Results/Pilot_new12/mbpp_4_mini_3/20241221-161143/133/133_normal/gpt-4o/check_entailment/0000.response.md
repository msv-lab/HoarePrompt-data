Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the two tuples are of different lengths. According to the problem description, it should subtract elements at the same index in the tuples, but using `zip` will truncate to the length of the shorter tuple, potentially leading to incorrect results.

For example, if we have the following input: 
```python
func_1((10, 4), (2, 5, 18)) 
```
The expected behavior for tuples of different lengths is unclear from the description, and the program will return `(8, -1)` since it will only perform the operation on the first two elements, disregarding the additional element in the second tuple.

Thus, due to the lack of clarity on how to handle tuples of different lengths and the incorrect result for the mentioned case, the program is considered incorrect.
