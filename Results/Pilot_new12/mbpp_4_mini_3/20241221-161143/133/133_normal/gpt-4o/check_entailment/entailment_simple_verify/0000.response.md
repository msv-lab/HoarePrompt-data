Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not clarify or handle cases where the two tuples are of different lengths. Using `zip` does result in truncation to the length of the shorter tuple, which could lead to loss of data and incorrect results if the tuples have different lengths. 

While the provided assertions document how the function behaves with specific inputs, they do not address cases with tuples of varying lengths, such as `func_1((10, 4), (2, 5, 18))`. The output of `(8, -1)` in this scenario is insufficient, as the expected behavior for the ignored additional elements is not specified, revealing a gap in the problem description. 

Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements set out in the problem statement, confirming that the assessment declaring the program's correctness as **False** is justifiable.
