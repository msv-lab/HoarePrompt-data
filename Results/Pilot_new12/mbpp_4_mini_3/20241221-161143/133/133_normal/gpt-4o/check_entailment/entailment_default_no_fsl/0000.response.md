Correctness: **False**

While the program does correctly compute the differences between the corresponding elements of the tuples when they are of the same length and contain numerical elements, it does not handle cases where the two tuples are of different lengths. The problem description specifies that the tuples must be of the same length, but there is no implementation in the `func_1` function to check for this requirement. 

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`, it will return `( -2, -2)` but this situation should raise a `ValueError` as per the output hints which state that the function must raise an error for tuples of different lengths. 

Additionally, if either tuple is empty, the program correctly returns an empty tuple, which matches the output hints. However, again, the lack of error handling for different-length tuples contradicts the requirements set forth in the problem description. 

Thus, since the program fails to properly check for tuple length requirements, it is deemed incorrect.
