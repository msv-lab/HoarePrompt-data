The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` has an issue when the input tuples have different lengths. It highlights that the function uses `zip`, which will truncate the longer tuple and may lead to unexpected results. Given the problem description requires subtracting corresponding elements, this behavior is not aligned with the expectations set out in the problem statement. 

However, the output hints specify that the function will raise a `ValueError` if the two tuples are not of the same length, which is a necessary requirement for the computation, suggesting a more robust implementation than what was initially analyzed. Yet, if this error handling is not actually implemented in the provided code (which it is not), this implies that the function cannot guarantee correct behavior with tuples of differing lengths. 

Since there is no evidence in the code that includes handling for length mismatches (the function directly performs operations without checking lengths), the output hints are not reflective of the current implementation. The function as it stands would not meet the problem's requirements fully due to the handling of length, thereby substantiating the original assessment that the correctness of the function is **False**. 

Therefore, after considering the original assessment and the detail provided in the output hints, the original assessment still holds true. The function does not meet the problem description because it lacks the necessary error handling for unequal tuple lengths.

Final: **False**
