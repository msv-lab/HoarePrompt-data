Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` and computes the element-wise subtraction of the elements from `tup1` using the corresponding elements from `tup2`. 

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input as Tuples**: The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as arguments. This aligns with the problem requirement of taking in tuples.
  
2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The function uses a generator expression `tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))`. The `zip` function pairs elements from the two tuples based on their indices, allowing the function to subtract them element by element.

3. **Returns a New Tuple**: The result is constructed as a tuple using the `tuple()` function around the generator expression, which is another requirement of the problem description.

4. **Handling of Indices**: The function handles the elements based on their indices correctly, as stated in the problem description.

5. **Operators**: The subtraction operation is clearly performed between the corresponding elements, which fulfills the requirement that the program subtracts the elements from `tup1` by those from `tup2`.

In conclusion, the function implements the required functionality as detailed in the problem description and will produce the correct output given valid input of the specified form. Therefore, the answer is True.
