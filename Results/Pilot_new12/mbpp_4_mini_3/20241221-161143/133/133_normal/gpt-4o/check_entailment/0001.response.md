To determine the correctness of the provided function `func_1`, we analyze the problem description and the source code.

**Problem Description:**
The function needs to take two tuples and subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple at the same index.

**Provided Code:**
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

**Assertions:**
```python
assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)
assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16)) == (-13, -43, -13)
assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12)) == (-3, 7, -3)
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` uses `zip` to combine the two tuples, which creates pairs of elements: `(a, b)` where `a` is from `tup1` and `b` is from `tup2`.
2. It then calculates the difference `a - b` for each pair and constructs a new tuple with these results.

### Edge Cases:
- The function assumes both input tuples are of the same length, as it uses `zip`. If they are of different lengths, the `zip` function will truncate the longer tuple to the length of the shorter one, which may lead to unexpected behavior. For example:
  ```python
  func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))  # This would return (-2, -2), ignoring the value 5 from the second tuple.
  ```

- If one or both tuples are empty:
  ```python
  func_1((), ())  # This would return an empty tuple () as expected.
  func_1((1,), ())  # This would return (1,), not performing subtraction.
  func_1((), (2,))  # This would return an empty tuple (), not performing subtraction.
  ```

These cases indicate that the function does not adhere strictly to the problem description as it does not provide error handling or return meaningful results when the tuples differ in length.

### Conclusion:
Since we have identified a scenario (different length tuples) where the function does not perform as expected according to the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
