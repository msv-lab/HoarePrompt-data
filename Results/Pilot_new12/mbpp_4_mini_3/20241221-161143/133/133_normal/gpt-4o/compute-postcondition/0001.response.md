The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, and they contain numerical elements. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple that contains the differences of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of the same length containing numerical elements and return a tuple of the differences between corresponding elements of the two input tuples.

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples of the same length, containing numerical elements, and returns a tuple containing the differences of corresponding elements from the two tuples.**
