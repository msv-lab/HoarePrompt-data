Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of equal length containing numerical elements, and returns a new tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of the two tuples, where each element in the resulting tuple is computed by subtracting the element from `tup2` from the corresponding element in `tup1`. The function will raise an error if `tup1` and `tup2` are not of equal length, though this case is not explicitly handled in the code. Therefore, the final output will depend on the input tuples being of equal length.**
