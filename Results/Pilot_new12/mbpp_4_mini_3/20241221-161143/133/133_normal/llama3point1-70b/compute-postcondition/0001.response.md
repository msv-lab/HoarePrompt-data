The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of equal length, containing numerical elements. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple that contains the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. Specifically, each element in the resulting tuple is calculated by subtracting the element in `tup2` from the corresponding element in `tup1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of equal length containing numerical elements and return a tuple containing the differences of their corresponding elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of equal length with numerical elements, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of the two tuples.**
