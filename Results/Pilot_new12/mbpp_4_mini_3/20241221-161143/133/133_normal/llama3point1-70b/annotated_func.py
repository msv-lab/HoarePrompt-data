#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of equal length, containing numerical elements.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of tuples 'tup1' and 'tup2'. Each element in the resulting tuple is calculated by subtracting an element from 'tup2' from the corresponding element in 'tup1'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of equal length containing numerical elements, and returns a new tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of the two tuples, where each element in the resulting tuple is computed by subtracting the element from `tup2` from the corresponding element in `tup1`. The function will raise an error if `tup1` and `tup2` are not of equal length, though this case is not explicitly handled in the code. Therefore, the final output will depend on the input tuples being of equal length.
