Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) as input and subtracts the elements of `tup2` from the corresponding elements of `tup1`. The use of the `zip()` function allows for pairing elements from the two tuples based on their indices, ensuring that the operation is performed element-wise. 

Hereâ€™s why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Element-wise Operation**: The program uses a generator expression that iterates over pairs of elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, correctly performing the subtraction for each corresponding index.

2. **Returns a Tuple**: The result is then converted back to a tuple, which matches the requirement to return the differences in tuple format.

3. **Handles Equal Length Tuples**: The problem description mentions that the tuples are of equal length, and the program appropriately processes them under this assumption.

Since the program correctly executes the mathematical operation of subtraction for each element of the input tuples and returns the result in the expected format, it aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements.

Overall, the function fulfills the description of taking two tuples and subtracting the elements at the same indices, leading to the conclusion that the program is correct.
