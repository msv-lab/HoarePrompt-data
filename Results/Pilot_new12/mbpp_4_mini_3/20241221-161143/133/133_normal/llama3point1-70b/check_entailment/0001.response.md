Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and subtracts the corresponding elements (by index) of these tuples. The use of the `zip` function pairs the elements from both tuples, and a generator expression calculates the difference for each pair. The output is then converted back into a tuple.

The function works correctly under the assumption that both tuples are of the same length. It will raise a `ValueError` if they are of different lengths, as `zip` will only iterate up to the shortest input iterator. 

Since the problem description does not specify how to handle tuples of different lengths, the current implementation can be considered correct as it adheres strictly to the described behavior of subtracting elements at corresponding indices.

Furthermore, if both input tuples contain elements of types that support subtraction (such as integers or floats), the output will be as expected.

Thus, I cannot think of any case where the program would fail to meet the problem requirements based on the provided descriptions.
