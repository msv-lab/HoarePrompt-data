Correctness: **True**.

The program takes two tuples and subtracts elements at the same index from each other, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The use of `zip` allows it to iterate through both tuples simultaneously, ensuring corresponding elements are paired for subtraction. 

All differences in corresponding elements will be computed correctly regardless of the length of the tuples, provided that they are of equal length since `zip` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, avoiding index errors. 

The function handles cases like:
- Both tuples being empty (returns an empty tuple).
- Tuples of the same length with varying values.

Every potential edge case works as expected, which validates the correctness of the implementation.
