Correctness: **False**

The program description states that the function should take two tuples and subtract the elements of the first tuple from the elements of the second tuple with the same index. However, the output hints indicate that the function will raise an error if the tuples are of unequal length, and this case is not explicitly handled in the code. Therefore, if the input tuples are not of equal length, the program will fail to execute properly. 

An example of a case where the program would not work correctly is:
- Input: `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`
- The function would attempt to process the tuples, but since they have different lengths, it will lead to an error.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
