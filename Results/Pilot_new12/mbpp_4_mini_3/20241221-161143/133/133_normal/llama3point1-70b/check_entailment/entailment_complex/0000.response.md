Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes in two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as parameters, as specified.
   
2. **Assumption of Equal Length**: The program contains an assumption (stated in the comments) that the input tuples are of equal length, which aligns with the problem's implicit requirements. The lack of explicit error handling for unequal lengths is acceptable under the assumption that valid input will always be provided.

3. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The crux of the problem is to subtract corresponding elements of the first tuple from the second tuple. The implementation uses a generator expression inside `tuple()`, in combination with `zip()`, to pair the elements from `tup1` and `tup2` and compute their differences correctly. 

4. **Returning a New Tuple**: The program encapsulates the result of the element-wise subtractions into a new tuple, thus adhering to the requirement of returning a tuple of differences.

Overall, the function effectively fulfills the requirement to subtract the elements of one tuple from another, index by index, ensuring that output is structured correctly and satisfies the problem description. Therefore, the function can be considered correct.
