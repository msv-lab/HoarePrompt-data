You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and subtracts the corresponding elements (by index) of these tuples. The use of the `zip` function pairs the elements from both tuples, and a generator expression calculates the difference for each pair. The output is then converted back into a tuple.

The function works correctly under the assumption that both tuples are of the same length. It will raise a `ValueError` if they are of different lengths, as `zip` will only iterate up to the shortest input iterator. 

Since the problem description does not specify how to handle tuples of different lengths, the current implementation can be considered correct as it adheres strictly to the described behavior of subtracting elements at corresponding indices.

Furthermore, if both input tuples contain elements of types that support subtraction (such as integers or floats), the output will be as expected.

Thus, I cannot think of any case where the program would fail to meet the problem requirements based on the provided descriptions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of equal length containing numerical elements, and returns a new tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of the two tuples, where each element in the resulting tuple is computed by subtracting the element from `tup2` from the corresponding element in `tup1`. The function will raise an error if `tup1` and `tup2` are not of equal length, though this case is not explicitly handled in the code. Therefore, the final output will depend on the input tuples being of equal length.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
