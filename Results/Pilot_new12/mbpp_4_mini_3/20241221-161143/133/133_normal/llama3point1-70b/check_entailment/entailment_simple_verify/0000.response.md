Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly fulfills the requirement of the problem description by taking two tuples and performing element-wise subtraction of corresponding indices. The use of `zip` ensures that elements are paired correctly for subtraction, and the program handles various edge cases, such as both tuples being empty, as observed in the annotations.

The annotation confirms that before the function call, both `tup1` and `tup2` are of equal length containing numerical elements, which reinforces that no index errors will occur during execution. The final output is a tuple of differences as expected.

Overall, the program is well-constructed to meet the stated requirements, and both the original assessment and annotations support its correctness. Thus, the program is indeed correct.
