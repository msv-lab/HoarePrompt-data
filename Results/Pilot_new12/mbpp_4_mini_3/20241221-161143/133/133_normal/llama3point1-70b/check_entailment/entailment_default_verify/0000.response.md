Final: **False**

The original assessment claims the program is correct, but it overlooks the fact that the function does not handle cases where the input tuples are of unequal lengths. While the program does correctly compute the differences for corresponding elements when both tuples are of equal length, it will silently truncate the longer tuple if they are of different lengths due to the behavior of `zip`. This means that if `tup1` has more elements than `tup2`, those extra elements in `tup1` will be ignored without any error, leading to potential unexpected results. 

Therefore, the correctness is dependent on the length of the tuples being equal, which is a condition that is not enforced within the function itself. Given that the output hints explicitly state that the function will raise an error if `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths, it is critical to note that the function's behavior does not align strictly with the problem description without this handling. Hence, the program's behavior as it stands does not meet the complete requirements of the problem description.
