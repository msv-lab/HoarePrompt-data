Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` is designed to take two tuples of equal length and subtract the elements at corresponding indices, which meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The annotations clarify that the function works under the assumption that the input tuples are of equal length and contain numerical elements. Additionally, they confirm that if the tuples are of equal length, the output will indeed be a tuple of differences as specified. The function only raises a `ValueError` for unequal length tuples, which is a behavior not specified in the problem description but does not inherently make the implementation incorrect. 

Assuming valid input as stipulated in the instructions further cements the correctness of the original assessment, as it aligns the program behavior with the expected output without erroneous conditions. Thus, the program adheres to the requirements with the given constraints, maintaining its correctness.
