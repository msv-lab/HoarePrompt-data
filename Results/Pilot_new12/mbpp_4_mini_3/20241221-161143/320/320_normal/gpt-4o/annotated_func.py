#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #The program returns the second unique integer from the sorted list 'unique_nums', provided that 'unique_nums' contains more than one unique integer. If 'unique_nums' has only one or no unique integers, it returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the second unique integer from the sorted list of unique integers. If `nums` contains less than two unique integers, the function will return None. The function does not handle the case where `nums` might be empty or contain non-integer values, but it is assumed that `nums` has at least two elements based on the initial comment. Thus, it is designed to correctly handle scenarios where there are duplicates and filters them out before attempting to find the second unique integer. The program ultimately provides a mechanism to access the second distinct value in sorted order or indicates the absence of such a value.
