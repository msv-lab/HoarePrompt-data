Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description, which states that it must find the second smallest number in a list. Here's an explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to accept a list of integers (`nums`), as stated in the annotations. Importantly, it is assumed (based on the annotation) that the input will always contain at least two elements.

2. **Unique Elements**: The program uses `set(nums)` to filter out duplicate values from the list, thereby ensuring that only unique integers are considered. This is essential for finding the second smallest number because duplicates would not contribute to a distinct second smallest value.

3. **Sorting**: The unique integers are sorted, which allows for straightforward retrieval of the second smallest value. 

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the second element (`unique_nums[1]`) from the sorted list of unique integers if there are at least two unique numbers (i.e., `len(unique_nums) > 1`). If there is only one unique number or none, it correctly returns `None`.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions test a variety of conditions:
   - In the first case, it correctly identifies `-2` as the second smallest among unique numbers in the list.
   - In the second case, it returns `-0.5` as the second smallest unique value among the inputs.
   - The last two cases correctly return `None` since there are not enough unique numbers to have a second smallest. 

Thus, the function adheres to the requirements of the problem description effectively, returning the correct second smallest number (or None when appropriate) under the assumptions stated.
