Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to find the second smallest number in a list. Here is why it meets the requirements:

1. **Handling of Unique Values**: The program uses `set(nums)` to eliminate duplicates, which ensures that only unique numbers are considered when determining the second smallest number.

2. **Sorting**: It then sorts the unique numbers with `sorted(set(nums))`, which allows us to easily access the second smallest number using indexing.

3. **Conditional Return**: The program checks if there are more than one unique number (`len(unique_nums) > 1`). If so, it returns the second smallest number with `unique_nums[1]`. If not, it returns `None` as specified in the problem description. 

4. **Tests**: The assertions provided cover a variety of cases:
   - The first two assertions demonstrate that the function correctly identifies the second smallest number from lists containing both positive and negative values, and where duplicates are present.
   - The last two assertions confirm that the function correctly returns `None` when there are not enough unique values to identify a second smallest (i.e., when all numbers are the same).

Therefore, the implementation is aligned with the problem description, ensuring it effectively finds the second smallest unique number in a list of integers.

In conclusion, the program behaves as intended for the specified inputs, thus the correctness is confirmed as True.
