Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to handle the case when the list contains fewer than two unique numbers correctly. According to the problem description, the function should return the second smallest number in the list. However, any list where all elements are the same or there is only one unique element (even if it appears multiple times) leads to a return value of `None` instead of raising an exception or indicating that a second distinct number does not exist.

For example, consider the following input:

```python
assert func_1([1]) == None  # There is no second smallest number.
```

This case shows that the function does not satisfy the requirement of finding the second smallest number since it only has one unique number. Hence, the implementation is incorrect as it does not address every potential case as specified in the problem description.
