Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the case where the input list `nums` is empty. According to the problem description, it should be able to find the second smallest number from the list, but if the list is empty, attempting to find a second smallest number would result in an error (indexing an empty list). The current implementation returns `None` only when there are not enough unique integers, but it does not account for the situation when the list itself is empty. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement for every potential case.
