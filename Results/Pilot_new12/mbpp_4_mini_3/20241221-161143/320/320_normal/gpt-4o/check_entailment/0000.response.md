Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly finds the second smallest number in a list. Here's the breakdown of its correctness:

- The function `func_1` first converts the input list `nums` into a set to remove duplicates, ensuring that only unique numbers are considered.
- It then sorts these unique numbers. 
- If there is more than one unique number, it returns the second smallest number (the element at index 1). If there is not, it returns `None`.
- The assertions given cover various cases including positive, negative, and duplicate numbers.

All test cases provided in the assertions pass, and the function behaves correctly according to the problem statement for the inputs tested. Since no potential cases have been identified where the code breaks or does not meet the requirements, it is concluded that the code is correct.
