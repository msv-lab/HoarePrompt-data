The variable `unique_nums` is assigned the value of `sorted(set(nums))`, which removes any duplicate integers from the list `nums` and then sorts the remaining unique integers in ascending order. The original state of `nums` remains unchanged, but `unique_nums` will now contain a sorted list of the unique integers from `nums`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums`.**
