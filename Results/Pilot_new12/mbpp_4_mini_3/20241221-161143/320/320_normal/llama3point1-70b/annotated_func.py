#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers, and the list contains at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating no value is being returned despite the presence of distinct elements in 'nums'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a list of the distinct integers from `nums`. The length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest distinct integer from list 'nums' by sorting 'unique_nums' and accessing the element at index 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, `nums`, which must contain at least two distinct elements. It first creates a list of unique integers from `nums`. If, after this operation, the number of unique integers is less than 2, the function returns None. If there are at least two unique integers, the function returns the second smallest distinct integer from `nums` by sorting the list of unique integers and accessing the element at index 1. The function does not handle cases where the input list may contain only duplicates (though this scenario is indirectly addressed by stating that `nums` must have at least two distinct elements). Lastly, it assumes that the input list is valid based on the required precondition, and there are no checks or error handling for potential invalid inputs.
