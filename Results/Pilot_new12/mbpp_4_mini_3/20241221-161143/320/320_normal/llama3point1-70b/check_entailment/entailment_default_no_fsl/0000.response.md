Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the second smallest distinct number in a list. It first converts the list to a set to eliminate duplicates, then checks if there are at least two unique elements. If there are, it sorts these unique elements and returns the second smallest one. 

Given the problem description explicitly states that the input list must contain at least two distinct elements, the code behaves correctly under that assumption by returning `None` when it does not meet that criterion. There are no uncovered edge cases that would lead to incorrect results, based on the provided specifications. Therefore, the code fulfills the requirements of the problem for valid input scenarios as described.
