You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers, and the list contains at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating no value is being returned despite the presence of distinct elements in 'nums'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a list of the distinct integers from `nums`. The length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest distinct integer from list 'nums' by sorting 'unique_nums' and accessing the element at index 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, `nums`, which must contain at least two distinct elements. It first creates a list of unique integers from `nums`. If, after this operation, the number of unique integers is less than 2, the function returns None. If there are at least two unique integers, the function returns the second smallest distinct integer from `nums` by sorting the list of unique integers and accessing the element at index 1. The function does not handle cases where the input list may contain only duplicates (though this scenario is indirectly addressed by stating that `nums` must have at least two distinct elements). Lastly, it assumes that the input list is valid based on the required precondition, and there are no checks or error handling for potential invalid inputs.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
