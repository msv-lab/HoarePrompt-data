Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` meets the requirements laid out in the problem description by successfully identifying the second smallest number in a list of integers containing at least two distinct values. The output hints align with the functionality of the code, confirming that it handles edge cases such as ensuring uniqueness and correctly returning `None` when there are insufficient unique numbers. The logic of sorting the unique list and selecting the second element is solid and effectively addresses the problem's demands. Given that we assume valid input and that the function meets all specified criteria, the assessment of correctness remains true.
