Explanation: The code appears to be correct for the problem description, which asks for the second smallest number in a list. The function first converts the input list, `nums`, into a set to eliminate duplicates, ensuring that only distinct elements are considered. If there are fewer than two unique numbers, the function correctly returns `None`, as expected. If there are at least two unique numbers, it sorts these numbers and returns the second smallest one by accessing the element at index 1. The output hints align with the code, confirming its functionality.

Thus, the program meets all requirements of the problem description and handles the expected cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
