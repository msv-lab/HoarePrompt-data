Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list of numbers based on the problem description. It first converts the list to a set to ensure uniqueness, and then it handles the case where there are fewer than two unique numbers by returning `None`. If there are at least two unique numbers, it sorts this unique list and returns the second element, which is indeed the second smallest number. All potential edge cases, such as duplicates and lists with less than two unique elements, are handled appropriately.
