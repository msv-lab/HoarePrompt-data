Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Although it is intended to find the second smallest number in a list of integers containing at least two distinct elements, it contains a critical logical flaw: 

1. The program first converts `nums` into `unique_nums`, which contains only distinct elements. It checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2, and if so, returns `None`. However, given the assumption in the problem description that `nums` has at least two distinct elements, this check is unnecessary. If that condition were to be true, it would indicate a failure in meeting the problem's precondition, as the input should always consist of at least two distinct integers.

2. Despite the above issue, if the input is valid, the function does return the second smallest number correctly by sorting the list of distinct elements and accessing the second element. But the unnecessary check at the beginning and return of `None` could mislead users about the intended functionality. 

Since there is a scenario where the function can return `None`—even though the problem asserts that there will always be at least two distinct integers—the function's behavior does not strictly align with the problem description. Thus, the program is considered not entirely correct.
