Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description. 

1. The program removes duplicates correctly, ensuring that only unique numbers are considered when determining the second smallest number. This aligns with the task objective of finding the second smallest number in a list.

2. The edge case handling is properly addressed by returning `None` if there are fewer than two unique numbers, and the annotation confirms that this check is applicable only when such cases are identified. Since we assume valid inputs (a list with at least two distinct integers), it confirms the program's robustness.

3. The logic to sort the unique numbers and retrieve the second smallest is sound, as shown in the annotations. After the provided `if` block is executed, the length of `unique_nums` is guaranteed to be at least 2 due to the annotations, and thus, the sorting and indexing is performed correctly.

Based on the above analysis and the supporting evidence in the annotations and original assessment, the program accurately meets the problem requirements.
