The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers containing at least two distinct elements. After executing the function body, if the appropriate conditions are met, the function either returns `None`, indicating no value is being returned despite the presence of distinct elements in 'nums', or it returns the second smallest distinct integer from the list 'nums' by sorting the unique elements and accessing the element at index 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return either `None` or the second smallest distinct integer from the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nums, which is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements. It returns None if specific conditions are met, otherwise it returns the second smallest distinct integer from nums.**
