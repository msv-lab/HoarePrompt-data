The code creates a set from the list `nums`, which removes any duplicate values. It then converts that set back into a list, storing the result in `unique_nums`. Since `nums` is a list of integers that contains at least two distinct elements, the resulting `unique_nums` list will contain those distinct integers from `nums` with potential duplicates removed.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a list of the distinct integers from `nums`.**
