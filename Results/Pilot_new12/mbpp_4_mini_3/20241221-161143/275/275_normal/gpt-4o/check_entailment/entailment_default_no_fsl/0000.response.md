Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is intended to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible by one another. However, the current implementation does not handle the case correctly when there are no divisible pairs in the list and will incorrectly return 1 for single integers.

For instance, if the input list is `[3, 5, 7]`, the output of the function would be 1, despite the fact that there are no pairs that are divisible by one another, and thus the largest subset wherein every pair is divisible should logically return 0.

Moreover, the output hints mention that the function assumes all integers are non-negative, which is good, but it does not clearly address the fact that the conditions of complete pairwise divisibility are not satisfied for certain collections of numbers, potentially meaning that outcomes could be misleading in cases with multiple non-divisible numbers.

Thus, the core requirement of returning the size of a subset where every pair is divisible fails in some scenarios, leading to the conclusion that the provided implementation does not meet the problem specifications in all potential cases.
