You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the function `func_1` based on the defined problem description of finding the largest subset of numbers from a list such that every pair of numbers is divisible by one another.

Here are the key points of my analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns `0`, which is correct behaviour for an empty input as there are no numbers to form any subsets.

2. **Sorting**: The list is sorted, which helps ensure that we are considering potential divisibility pairs in order.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function uses a dynamic programming array `dp`, where `dp[i]` stores the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`. The nested loops iterate through every pair of indices, checking divisibility. 

4. **Main Logic for Divisibility**: The program checks if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` (where `j < i`). If this condition is true, it updates the dp value for `dp[i]` to reflect whether a larger divisible subset can be formed by adding `nums[i]` to the subset that ends with `nums[j]`. 

5. **Result Calculation**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the dp array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

Now, let's assess whether the implementation covers all potential cases:

### Edge Cases:

1. **Single Element Case**: If input is a single element list, for example, `func_1([7])`, the function should return `1`, which it will do correctly since there is only one element, and thus the subset is `{7}`.

2. **No Divisible Pairs**: Consider a case such as `func_1([2, 3, 5, 7])`. In this scenario, since none of the numbers are divisible by one another, the largest divisible subset would be just any single element, resulting in an output of `1`. The function will correctly handle this case returning `1`.

3. **All Elements are Factors**: If all elements in the list are multiples (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 4, 8])`), the function will compute it correctly since each element is divisible by the previous ones.

4. **Larger Numbers with Mixed Divisibility**: The program should also handle cases with larger numbers and mixed divisibility properly, for instance, `func_1([8, 16, 32, 2])`. This will yield the maximum subset of size 4 as all are divisible by 2.

5. **Negative Numbers**: The current implementation does not consider negative numbers. If we input `func_1([-2, -4, -8])`, the function would also yield a correct output (3) since all negative numbers are divisible by each other in terms of absolute values. However, ideally, the problem should clarify if negatives are expected.

### Conclusion:

I could not find any case where the function fails to meet the criteria set in the problem description. It seems to correctly calculate the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible based on multiple test cases and logical reasoning.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. If `nums` is empty, the function returns 0. If `nums` is not empty, it first sorts the list and then calculates the length of the longest divisible subset of that list. The function returns the maximum length of these divisible subsets, represented by the `dp` array, where each `dp[i]` indicates the length of the longest divisible subset ending at the `i`-th index of `nums`. The function assumes that all integers in `nums` are non-negative, as negative integers could lead to division conditions that may not be meaningful in the context of "divisibility." Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are no divisible pairs, as it will still return 1 for any single integer present in a non-empty list, which may not align with user expectations if the context is strictly about divisible subsets.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
