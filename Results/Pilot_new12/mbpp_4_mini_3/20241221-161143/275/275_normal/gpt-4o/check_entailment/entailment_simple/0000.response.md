To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description
We need a function that finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible by each other.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(nums)` checks if the input list `nums` is empty and returns `0` if it is. This is appropriate as there cannot be a subset of an empty list.

2. **Sorting**: The list is sorted. This is a good step because it can help with the divisibility checks later on â€” if `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[j]`, then for every pair, `nums[j]` can potentially divide `nums[i]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: 
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `1`s because each number in the list can form a subset of size `1` by itself.
   - This array is used to keep track of the lengths of the longest divisible subsets that end with each respective number in `nums`.

4. **Nested Loop for Checking Divisibility**: 
   - The outer loop iterates over each number in the sorted list, while the inner loop checks all prior numbers.
   - For each pair of numbers (`nums[i]`, `nums[j]`), if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates the `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value or the value of `dp[j] + 1`. This correctly tracks the largest subset found so far.

5. **Return Statement**: The function returns the maximum value found in `dp`, which gives the size of the largest subset of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible.

### Conclusion
The program correctly identifies the largest subset where every pair is divisible. It handles edge cases (like empty lists) properly and utilizes an efficient algorithm with nested loops to ensure all combinations are checked.

**Correctness**: **True** 

### Explanation of Correctness
The program correctly implements a dynamic programming approach to identify the largest subset of numbers such that every pair in that subset is divisible. It accurately captures the requirements specified in the problem description and effectively processes valid input as stipulated. Since it works for all valid cases (including edge cases) as described in the prompt, it fulfills the problem's requirements entirely.
