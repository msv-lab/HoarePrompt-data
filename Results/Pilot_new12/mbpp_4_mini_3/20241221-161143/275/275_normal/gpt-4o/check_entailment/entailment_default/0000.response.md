The given function `func_1` is designed to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in that subset is divisible by each other. Let's analyze the provided program and the output hints to determine its correctness.

**Program Analysis:**
1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it correctly returns `0`.
2. Next, the list is sorted, which is an essential step for the algorithm to work correctly as it allows us to consider smaller numbers first for divisibility.
3. A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to keep track of the longest divisible subset ending at each index.
4. The nested loops check for pairs of numbers where the condition of divisibility is met, updating the `dp` array appropriately.
5. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` array.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
The hints explain that the function correctly handles non-empty lists by searching for the length of the longest divisible subset. They also mention that the function does not handle cases where there are no divisible pairs adequately. The current implementation will return `1` for any number on its own, which means if a list has multiple numbers that are all mutually non-divisible (e.g., `nums = [2, 3, 5]`), it would inaccurately return `1` instead of `0`.

**Potential Issue:**
If all elements in the input list are prime numbers and greater than `1`, the largest subset where every pair is divisible will be just `1` (since no two distinct primes are divisible by each other). The expected output in such a case is `0` per the problem specification since we want subsets where every pair is divisible, and this scenario would yield no such subset.

**Conclusion:**
Given the analysis above, there exists at least one case (e.g., when the input is `[2, 3, 5]`) where the output does not match the problem descriptionâ€™s requirements. The function would return `1` instead of `0`, leading to an overall incorrect solution.

Correctness: **False**.
