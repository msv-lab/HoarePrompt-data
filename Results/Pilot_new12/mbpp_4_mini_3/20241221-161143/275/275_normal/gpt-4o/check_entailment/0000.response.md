To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze the function `func_1` and its logic.

### Problem description:
The task is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair within this subset is divisible.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Sorting**:
    - The program starts by checking if the input `nums` is empty and returns 0, which is correct behavior.
    - It sorts the list, allowing us to ensure that we check divisibility in increasing order.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - The `dp` list is initialized to 1 for each number, assuming that each number can be a subset with itself.
    - The nested loops (with indices `i` and `j`) iterate through the sorted list to check pairs of numbers to see if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
    - If the condition holds, it updates the `dp[i]`, which correctly maintains the count of the largest subset size including `nums[i]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - The program looks good in routine cases, but we should consider edge cases like negative numbers and zeros.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the case of input `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

- The number 0 can be divisible by any number, which implies that the largest subset should contain 0 and the other numbers.
- However, with the current implementation, the function may not handle zeros appropriately when counting divisibility. Specifically, it might not correctly account for the presence of 0 in pairs since all numbers are divisible by 0.

**Conclusion**:
Given that the program does not explicitly test for conditions that allow for zero and potentially fails with this input, we find:

Correctness: **False**.
