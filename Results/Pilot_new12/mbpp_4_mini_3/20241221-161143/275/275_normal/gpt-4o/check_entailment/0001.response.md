To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze the function `func_1` based on the defined problem description of finding the largest subset of numbers from a list such that every pair of numbers is divisible by one another.

Here are the key points of my analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns `0`, which is correct behaviour for an empty input as there are no numbers to form any subsets.

2. **Sorting**: The list is sorted, which helps ensure that we are considering potential divisibility pairs in order.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function uses a dynamic programming array `dp`, where `dp[i]` stores the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`. The nested loops iterate through every pair of indices, checking divisibility. 

4. **Main Logic for Divisibility**: The program checks if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` (where `j < i`). If this condition is true, it updates the dp value for `dp[i]` to reflect whether a larger divisible subset can be formed by adding `nums[i]` to the subset that ends with `nums[j]`. 

5. **Result Calculation**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the dp array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

Now, let's assess whether the implementation covers all potential cases:

### Edge Cases:

1. **Single Element Case**: If input is a single element list, for example, `func_1([7])`, the function should return `1`, which it will do correctly since there is only one element, and thus the subset is `{7}`.

2. **No Divisible Pairs**: Consider a case such as `func_1([2, 3, 5, 7])`. In this scenario, since none of the numbers are divisible by one another, the largest divisible subset would be just any single element, resulting in an output of `1`. The function will correctly handle this case returning `1`.

3. **All Elements are Factors**: If all elements in the list are multiples (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 4, 8])`), the function will compute it correctly since each element is divisible by the previous ones.

4. **Larger Numbers with Mixed Divisibility**: The program should also handle cases with larger numbers and mixed divisibility properly, for instance, `func_1([8, 16, 32, 2])`. This will yield the maximum subset of size 4 as all are divisible by 2.

5. **Negative Numbers**: The current implementation does not consider negative numbers. If we input `func_1([-2, -4, -8])`, the function would also yield a correct output (3) since all negative numbers are divisible by each other in terms of absolute values. However, ideally, the problem should clarify if negatives are expected.

### Conclusion:

I could not find any case where the function fails to meet the criteria set in the problem description. It seems to correctly calculate the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible based on multiple test cases and logical reasoning.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
