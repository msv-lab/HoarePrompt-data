In the provided code snippet, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows:

- `dp[i]` is the length of the longest divisible subset for the element at index `i`.
- `dp[j]` is the length of the longest divisible subset for the element at index `j`.
- As stated, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, which means the condition for updating `dp[i]` based on `dp[j]` is valid.

Since `dp[i]` is updated with the maximum value of itself or `dp[j] + 1`, it implies that `i` will likely represent a longer divisible subset than previously counted if `dp[j]` is greater than `dp[i] - 1`.

However, without specific numerical values for `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`, we can only describe the relationship rather than providing specific numerical updates.

Therefore, the Output State is: the length of the longest divisible subset at index `i` is updated to be the maximum between its previous length and the length at index `j` plus one, reflecting the addition of one more divisible element.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is initialized to 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.**
