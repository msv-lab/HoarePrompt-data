The code `nums.sort()` sorts the list of integers `nums` in place in ascending order. The previous state indicates that `nums` is a list of integers and that it is not empty, but it does not provide specific values for the elements in the list. Therefore, while `nums` will be sorted, we can't define the exact output values after the operation without knowing the actual contents of `nums`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `nums` is now sorted but does not specify the exact contents:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.**
