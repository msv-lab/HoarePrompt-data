According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The for loop is set to iterate from `0` to `i - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute, `i` needs to be at least `1`. 

Since `i` is currently equal to `len(nums)`, and `nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, it follows that `i` will be greater than or equal to `1`.

At the start of the loop, `j` should begin at `0`, which is the initial value of the loop index. 

Thus, to modify the state for the loop to execute, we need to adjust it as follows:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 0.**
