According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the current value of `i`. The loop is designed to iterate over the range from 0 to \(i-1\) (i.e., it iterates `j` from 0 to `i-1`). 

At the end of the last iteration, we do not know the specific value of `i`, but it must be noted that `i` is at least `1` (since `nums` is not empty). Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least `2`, which allows `j` to take the value `0` or `1`.

Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, the values are:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty,
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element,
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to run again, indicating that `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time it should be 2, and `j` must take the values `0` and `1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is 2**
