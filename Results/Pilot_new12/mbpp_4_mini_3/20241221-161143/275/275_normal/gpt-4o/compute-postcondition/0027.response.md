Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.***
