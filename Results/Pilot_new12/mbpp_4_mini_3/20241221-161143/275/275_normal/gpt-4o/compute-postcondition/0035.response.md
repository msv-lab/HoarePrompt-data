`dp[i]` is assigned the value `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. Here, `dp[i]` will either retain its previous value or be updated to `dp[j] + 1`. The exact previous values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` are unknown, but we know that `j` is equal to 1, meaning we are comparing `dp[i]` with `dp[1] + 1`. The states of `nums` and `i` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`.**
