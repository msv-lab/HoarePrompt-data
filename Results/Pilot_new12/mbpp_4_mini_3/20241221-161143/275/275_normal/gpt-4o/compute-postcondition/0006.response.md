According to the code, the loop will iterate based on the variable `j` which relies on `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0, otherwise the range will be empty and the loop will not execute. Since `i` is currently 0, it needs to be adjusted. 

Therefore, we need `i` to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variables `nums` and `dp` do not affect the execution of this loop as it is only dependent on `i`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0**
