The variable `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The states of `nums` and `dp` contain specific values based on their previous definitions in relation to `i` and `j`. 

Assuming that `i` is currently 2 and it corresponds to the third element of `nums`, the code selects values from `dp` for that index and from the `j` index. We do not have specific values for `dp` and `j`, but their relationship is established. Therefore, we can express `dp[2]` as being updated accordingly.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is 2; `dp[2]` is updated to `max(dp[2], dp[j] + 1)`.**
