Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, and `i` is greater than 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `dp[j]` is at least 1. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
