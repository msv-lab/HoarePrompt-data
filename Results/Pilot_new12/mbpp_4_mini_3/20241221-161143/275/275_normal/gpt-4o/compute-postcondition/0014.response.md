The line of code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the `dp` list at index `i` by taking the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged in their respective states.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty.
- `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`.
- `i` is at least 2.
- `j` is 2.

The value of `dp[i]` will be updated based on the current value of `dp[j]` and the additional 1. Since `dp` initially contains all 1s, the updated value `dp[j] + 1` will evaluate to `1 + 1 = 2`. Therefore, `dp[i]` will take the maximum of its current value (which is 1) and 2. Consequently, if `dp[i]` was less than 2, it will be increased to 2.

The output state therefore reflects this potential increase in `dp[i]`, noting that the values of `nums`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain as they are, except for `dp[i]`, which could become 2.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 2; `dp[i]` is either 1 or 2, depending on its prior value.**
