Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, and `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending at `nums[i]`. If `i` is greater than 0, then for each `j` in the range [0, i), if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
