The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it implies that this condition supports building `dp[i]` based on previous values in the `dp` list. 

The impact of the code is:
1. `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
2. Since `dp` is a list of 1s initially and based on the fact that `i` is greater than 0, `dp[j]` must hold a value that reflects some previous valid state (greater than or equal to 1 due to the initial conditions).

Assuming `dp[j]` is at least 1 (which it is because all elements start as 1), the new `dp[i]` will be at least 2 (if `dp[j]` was chosen to increment).

The states of other variables (`nums`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` is updated at index `i`, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1` where `dp[j]` is at least 1, and `i` is greater than 0.**
