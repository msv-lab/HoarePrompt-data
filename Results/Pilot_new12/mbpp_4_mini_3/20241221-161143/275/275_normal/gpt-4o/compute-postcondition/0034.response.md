According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, starting from 0 and going up to `i - 1`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is initialized to 0, and since `i` is greater than 0 (implying that `i` is at least 1), the loop can execute again for the next value of `j`, which would be 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from its previous value. Thus, we require that `i` remains the same or is increased to allow more `j` iterations in future iterations.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
