According to the code, the loop will execute for each index in the range from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers and is not empty, `len(nums)` is at least 1, meaning the loop will execute at least once.

At the start of the loop, `i` will take on values starting from `0` and will increment by `1` on each iteration until it reaches `len(nums) - 1`. Since the variable `dp` is initialized as a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, it is ready to be used during the execution of the loop, without needing to make adjustments.

Therefore, the states need to be clarified as follows: 

- `i` would need to be set to its initial value, which is `0` on the first iteration.
  
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 0**
