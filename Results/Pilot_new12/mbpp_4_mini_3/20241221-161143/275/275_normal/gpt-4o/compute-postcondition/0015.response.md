Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, `i` is at least 2, and `j` is 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is either 1 or 2, depending on its prior value; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
