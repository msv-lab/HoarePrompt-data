Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is initialized to 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.***
