Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.***
