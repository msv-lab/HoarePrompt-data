According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the `nums` list. The execution depends on the length of `nums`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, it has at least 1 element. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` has taken values starting from 0 up to `len(nums) - 1`. 

To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the next value of `i`. If `i` is currently at `len(nums) - 1`, which corresponds to the last index of the list `nums`, the next value would be `i = len(nums)`, which is outside the valid range for the loop.

Thus, the loop can execute one more time if the current value of `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. If that's the case, `i` would increase by 1, and so we can expect the next index to be `i + 1`.

Given that we don't know the current value of `i`, but we know it must be within the bounds of the `nums` list and that `nums` is not empty, we can summarize the expected states:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, and `dp[i]` is the longest length of the divisible subset ending with `nums[len(nums) - 1]`, and for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be at least `len(nums)`, indicating we cannot execute again.** 

However, if we were considering the adjustment with the current `i` value indicative, we could express it as follows, but since this holds at terminating point, we can iterate on the previous index:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` must be less than `len(nums)` to continue valid iterations.**
