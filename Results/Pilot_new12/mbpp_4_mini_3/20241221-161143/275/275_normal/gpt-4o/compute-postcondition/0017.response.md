According to the code, the loop executes based on the range defined by `len(nums)`. The variable `i` is currently equal to the length of `nums`, which means that the loop has completed its iterations because `i` is not less than `len(nums)`. 

In this case, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to point to the next index, and since it currently equals the length of the list, the loop cannot execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, and `i` is equal to the length of `nums`. Hence, for the loop to potentially execute again, `i` should be incremented (although it's already at the maximum limit), and we would be looking for a new value of `i` that is less than the length of `nums` which cannot be achieved as it is already equal to that.

Thus, the appropriate statement reflecting the inability to continue the loop should be: 
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, which indicates the loop has finished executing.**
