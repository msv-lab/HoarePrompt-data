According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is at least 1, as the range for `j` is from 0 to `i - 1`. Since `nums` is a sorted list and `dp` has lengths for each corresponding `nums` element, the prior conditions need to ensure `i` is set correctly to allow the loop to execute. If `i` is 0, the loop will not execute. Hence, for the loop to run, `i` should be at least 1, and `j` will initialize from 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is initialized to 0**
