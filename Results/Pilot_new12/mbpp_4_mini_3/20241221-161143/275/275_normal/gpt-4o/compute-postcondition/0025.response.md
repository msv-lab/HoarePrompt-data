According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop runs for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, and `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets. The maximum value of `j` in the previous iteration was `i-1`, meaning the loop executed with `j` taking values from 0 up to `i-1`. 

Now, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented to `i + 1`, thereby allowing `j` to take values from 0 to `i`, which would mean the check for divisibility can now consider another element in `nums`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.**
