According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` which ranges from 0 to `i-1`. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that the index `j` must be less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, which means the last value of `j` could have been either 0 or 1 (or higher, depending on the value of `i`). 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will need to increase by 1 in the next iteration. Thus, `j` will become 2. 

Since `i` is at least 2 and the loop will continue to execute while `j` is less than `i`, `i` will remain unchanged, and `dp` may be updated if the conditions inside the loop hold true.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
