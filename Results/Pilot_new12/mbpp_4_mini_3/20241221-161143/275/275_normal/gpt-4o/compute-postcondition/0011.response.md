The line of code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the `dp` list at index `i` to be the maximum of its current value and the value at index `j` plus one. The values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` are known, and since `i` must be at least 2, we recognize that `i` and `j` are both valid indices in the `dp` list. The state of `dp` depends on the values previously held at `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`.

The impact of this code will be to potentially change the value at `dp[i]` based on its previous value and the computed value at `dp[j] + 1`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` is updated at index `i` to be either its current value or `dp[j] + 1`, where `dp[j]` is the value before this update and `i` is at least 2.**
