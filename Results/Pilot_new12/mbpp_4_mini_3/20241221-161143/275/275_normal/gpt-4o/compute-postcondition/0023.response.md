In the given state, we have `nums` as a sorted list of integers, `dp` holding the lengths of the longest divisible subsets corresponding to each element in `nums`, `i` equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` equal to 1. 

The line of code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` implies we need to update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. 

- `dp[i]` is updated based on its previous value and the value at `dp[j] + 1`. 
- Since `j` is equal to 1, we are considering `dp[1]`, which is the second element in `dp`. 
- Therefore, `dp[i]` will be updated to either its existing value or `dp[1] + 1`.

As a result, since the initial states of `nums` and `dp` are not specifically defined in their values, the only specific update we can provide is related to the changes to `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element (with `dp[i]` updated to max(`dp[i]`, `dp[1] + 1`),  `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 1**.
