According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is less than `i`. In this case, at the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, which indicates that the loop has iterated through all indices from `0` to `i-1`. The current value of `j` is `0`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for each subsequent iteration of the loop. Therefore, when the loop starts again, `j` will be `1`. However, for the loop to actually execute, `j` must be less than `i`, meaning `i` must be at least `1` to allow for this increment.

At this point, since `i` is equal to `len(nums)` and `j` is currently `0`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should become `1`, and we need to ensure that `len(nums)` remains the same since the loop structure does not modify `nums`.

Thus, to summarize the states that need adjustment, we have:
- `nums` remains unchanged (as it is a sorted list of integers that is not empty),
- `dp` also remains unchanged (as it contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets),
- `i` remains as `len(nums)`, and
- `j` is updated to `1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 1**.
