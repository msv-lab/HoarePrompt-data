According to the code, the for loop iterates with the variable `j` over the range from `0` to `i - 1`. Since `i` is greater than `0` at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute again if `i` is at least 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than `0`, meaning `j` can take on values from `0` to `i-1`. If `i` is currently 1, the loop cannot execute again because there are no more values for `j` to iterate through. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must increase to at least 2 (so that `j` can take on a value of `0` and `1`), allowing for an additional iteration of the loop.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`, and `i` must be at least 2.**
