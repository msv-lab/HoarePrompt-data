The line of code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value at index `i` in the `dp` list. The new value is the maximum of the current `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. 

- `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with the element at index `i`.
- `dp[j]` corresponds to the longest divisible subset length for another element at index `j` (where `j` is expected to be less than `i` and where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`). 

- The previous value of `dp[i]` remains the same unless the computed value (i.e., `dp[j] + 1`) exceeds it.

Other variables such as `nums` and `i` remain unaffected in terms of their fundamental properties, but `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is updated at index `i` to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`**
