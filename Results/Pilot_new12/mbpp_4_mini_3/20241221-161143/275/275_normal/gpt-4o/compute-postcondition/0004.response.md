`dp` is assigned a list where each element is initialized to 1, and the length of the list is equal to the length of `nums`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers and is not empty, the value of `dp` will be a list of 1s with the same size as `nums`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, and `nums` is not empty; `dp` is a list of 1s with the same length as `nums`.**
