    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers that is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each corresponding `nums` element, and each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending at `nums[i]`, where `dp[i]` is at least 1.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subset from the lengths stored in the 'dp' array, where each 'dp[i]' represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending at 'nums[i]' and is at least 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. If `nums` is empty, the function returns 0. If `nums` is not empty, it first sorts the list and then calculates the length of the longest divisible subset of that list. The function returns the maximum length of these divisible subsets, represented by the `dp` array, where each `dp[i]` indicates the length of the longest divisible subset ending at the `i`-th index of `nums`. The function assumes that all integers in `nums` are non-negative, as negative integers could lead to division conditions that may not be meaningful in the context of "divisibility." Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are no divisible pairs, as it will still return 1 for any single integer present in a non-empty list, which may not align with user expectations if the context is strictly about divisible subsets.
