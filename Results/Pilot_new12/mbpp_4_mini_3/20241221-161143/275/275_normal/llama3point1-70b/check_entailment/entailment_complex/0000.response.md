Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Function Invocation**: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. This aligns with the requirement of the problem statement.

2. **Empty List Handling**: The function first checks if `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns `0`, which is an appropriate response since there cannot be a subset if there are no numbers. This aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Sorting**: If `nums` is not empty, the function sorts the list. Sorting is important because it allows the function to efficiently find pairs where one number is divisible by another.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp`, where each entry corresponds to the length of the longest divisible subset that can be formed ending with the respective number in the sorted list. The nested loops correctly compute the lengths of these subsets based on the divisibility condition.

5. **Finding Maximum Length**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which accurately represents the size of the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible, as stated in the problem description.

Overall, the program effectively meets all aspects of the problem description, demonstrating correct logic and structure to solve the stated problem. Thus, the response is that the program is correct.
