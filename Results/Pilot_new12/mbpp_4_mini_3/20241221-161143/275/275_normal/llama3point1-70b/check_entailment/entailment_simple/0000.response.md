Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which requires finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible.

### Explanation:

1. **Handling Edge Case**: The program begins by checking if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns `0`, which is appropriate since there cannot be any subset in an empty list.

2. **Sorting the List**: The function sorts the list `nums`. Sorting is a necessary step because it ensures that when evaluating divisibility, any potential divisible pairs are easier to handle; specifically, if `nums[j]` divides `nums[i]`, then `nums[j]` will be less than or equal to `nums[i]` after sorting.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function uses a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` tracks the maximum length of the subset that can end with the element `nums[i]`. 
   - The outer loop iterates over each element in `nums`, while the inner loop examines all previous elements to determine if they can form a divisible subset with the current element.
   - Whenever `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, indicating that `nums[j]` divides `nums[i]`, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum subset length found so far.

4. **Retrieving the Result**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which corresponds to the largest size of the divisible subset.

The logic followed in the program ensures that all requirements from the problem statement are satisfied, and it effectively calculates the largest subset size with the specified divisibility condition. Thus, the program is correct and fulfills the problem description as required.
