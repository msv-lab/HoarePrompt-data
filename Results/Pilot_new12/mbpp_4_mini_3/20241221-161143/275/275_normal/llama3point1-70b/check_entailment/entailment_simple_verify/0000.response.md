Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1(nums)` correctly calculates the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. 

1. **Initial Check**: The function checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function correctly returns 0, which aligns with the problem description since there are no subsets in an empty list.

2. **Sorting**: By sorting the input list, the function ensures that it processes smaller numbers first, which is crucial for the divisibility checks.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The annotated code describes that the `dp` list stores the maximum length of divisible subsets for each element. The nested loops effectively compare each element with its predecessors, checking for divisibility, and updates the `dp` list accordingly.

4. **Final Output**: The function returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

The annotations confirm the logic and flow of the program, illustrating that all necessary conditions and edge cases are properly managed. Therefore, the conclusion that the program is correct stands validated.
