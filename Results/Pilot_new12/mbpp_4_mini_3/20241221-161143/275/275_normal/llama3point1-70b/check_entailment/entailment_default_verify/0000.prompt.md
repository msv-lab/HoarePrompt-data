You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1(nums)` correctly determines the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. It does this by utilizing a dynamic programming approach where it sorts the numbers and iteratively builds up the maximum subset size by checking divisibility conditions between elements. 

- The function first checks if the input list is empty, returning 0 if true, which is appropriate as there are no subsets in an empty list.
- It sorts the numbers to ensure smaller numbers are processed first, which is essential for checking divisibility.
- The nested loops correctly compare each number with those preceding it, updating the maximum subset size whenever a divisible pair is found.

All cases and edge cases in the problem description are effectively handled, ensuring correctness.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, `nums`. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. If `nums` contains elements, it sorts the list and constructs a dynamic programming array `dp`. This array keeps track of the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in the sorted list. The function then returns the maximum value from this `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest divisible subset from the numbers in `nums`. The function effectively identifies how many numbers in `nums` can be divided by one another to form the longest subset where each number is a multiple of a preceding one.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
