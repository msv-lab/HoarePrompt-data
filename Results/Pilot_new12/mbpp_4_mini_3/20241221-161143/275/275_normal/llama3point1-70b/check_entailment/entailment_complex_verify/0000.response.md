Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code, including the annotated version. The function `func_1(nums)` correctly implements a dynamic programming approach to find the size of the largest subset of numbers in which every pair is divisible by one another. 

Key points supporting the correctness are as follows:

1. The function handles an empty input by returning 0, which is appropriate behavior since there are no subsets to consider.
2. It correctly sorts the numbers to facilitate the proper checking of divisibility among the elements.
3. The nested loops accurately assess divisibility, updating the dynamic programming array `dp` to reflect the longest subsets that can be formed.
4. The annotation clarifies the state after critical operations, confirming that the function's logic aligns with the expected outcomes per the problem description.

Hence, the function successfully meets the outlined requirements, and the annotations support this conclusion.
