You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers that is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with the corresponding element in `nums`. `dp` contains values reflecting the maximum length of divisible subsets formed from the elements of `nums`, ranging from 1 to the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least one integer, `dp` will also have a corresponding entry for that integer. If `nums` is empty, `dp` will be an empty list.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value of the longest divisible subsets from the list `dp`, where `dp` contains values reflecting the lengths of the longest divisible subsets formed from the elements of the sorted list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, `nums`. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. If `nums` contains elements, it sorts the list and constructs a dynamic programming array `dp`. This array keeps track of the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in the sorted list. The function then returns the maximum value from this `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest divisible subset from the numbers in `nums`. The function effectively identifies how many numbers in `nums` can be divided by one another to form the longest subset where each number is a multiple of a preceding one.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
