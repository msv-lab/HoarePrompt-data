Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1(nums)` correctly determines the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. It does this by utilizing a dynamic programming approach where it sorts the numbers and iteratively builds up the maximum subset size by checking divisibility conditions between elements. 

- The function first checks if the input list is empty, returning 0 if true, which is appropriate as there are no subsets in an empty list.
- It sorts the numbers to ensure smaller numbers are processed first, which is essential for checking divisibility.
- The nested loops correctly compare each number with those preceding it, updating the maximum subset size whenever a divisible pair is found.

All cases and edge cases in the problem description are effectively handled, ensuring correctness.
