You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers within the subset is divisible by each other. 

Here's a breakdown of how the algorithm works:

1. It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns 0, which is the expected behavior.
2. The list is sorted, ensuring that when checking divisibility, smaller numbers are always checked first.
3. It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the number at index `i`. Initially, every element can at least form a subset of size 1 (itself), so it is initialized to 1.
4. A nested loop structure is then used:
   - The outer loop iterates through each number starting from the second element.
   - The inner loop checks all preceding numbers to see if the current number is divisible by any of them. If it is, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
5. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

The implementation effectively handles various cases including:
- Duplicates in the input, since they can extend the divisible subset size.
- Different combinations of numbers, including large and small integers.

Overall, this code adheres to the problem requirements and produces correct results for any relevant input case, confirming its correctness.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers that is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with the corresponding element in `nums`. `dp` contains values reflecting the maximum length of divisible subsets formed from the elements of `nums`, ranging from 1 to the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least one integer, `dp` will also have a corresponding entry for that integer. If `nums` is empty, `dp` will be an empty list.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value of the longest divisible subsets from the list `dp`, where `dp` contains values reflecting the lengths of the longest divisible subsets formed from the elements of the sorted list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, `nums`. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. If `nums` contains elements, it sorts the list and constructs a dynamic programming array `dp`. This array keeps track of the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in the sorted list. The function then returns the maximum value from this `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest divisible subset from the numbers in `nums`. The function effectively identifies how many numbers in `nums` can be divided by one another to form the longest subset where each number is a multiple of a preceding one.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
