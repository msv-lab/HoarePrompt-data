Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of integers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. 

### Explanation:

1. **Handling Empty List**: The function checks for an empty list at the beginning and returns 0, which corresponds with the requirement that if there are no numbers, the size of the subset is zero.

2. **Sorting**: The list is sorted, which allows us to efficiently check for divisibility in pairs. The sorting is crucial because it ensures that when checking `nums[i] % nums[j]`, we are only checking previous numbers that can be considered potential divisors.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The use of a dynamic programming array `dp` to keep track of the longest subset lengths is appropriate. Each element in this array is initialized to 1 because each number can at least form a subset of size one by itself.

4. **Nested Loop for Divisibility Check**: The nested loops check each pair of elements to see if they fulfill the divisibility condition. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to reflect the possibility of a larger subset that includes `nums[i]`.

5. **Final Output**: The maximum value from the `dp` array is returned, which accurately represents the longest divisible subset.

### Edge Cases:

- The program considers all valid inputs as specified (i.e., a list of integers). It handles an empty input correctly and all potential cases are managed through the dynamic programming methodology.

Thus, based on the analysis and output hints, the program satisfies all conditions described in the problem statement, indicating its correctness.
