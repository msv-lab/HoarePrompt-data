Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers within the subset is divisible by each other. 

Here's a breakdown of how the algorithm works:

1. It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns 0, which is the expected behavior.
2. The list is sorted, ensuring that when checking divisibility, smaller numbers are always checked first.
3. It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the number at index `i`. Initially, every element can at least form a subset of size 1 (itself), so it is initialized to 1.
4. A nested loop structure is then used:
   - The outer loop iterates through each number starting from the second element.
   - The inner loop checks all preceding numbers to see if the current number is divisible by any of them. If it is, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
5. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

The implementation effectively handles various cases including:
- Duplicates in the input, since they can extend the divisible subset size.
- Different combinations of numbers, including large and small integers.

Overall, this code adheres to the problem requirements and produces correct results for any relevant input case, confirming its correctness.
