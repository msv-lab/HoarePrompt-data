According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `i`, which is currently equal to `len(nums)`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i - 1`. Since the loop's current structure allows `j` to iterate from `0` to `i - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be one more than its current value.

Since `i` is equal to `len(nums)` at the end of the last iteration, and `j` is currently `1`, the next valid iteration would have to increment `j`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be `2` or more, but for this next execution to occur, `i` needs to be at least `3`. 

Therefore, the key states that need to be updated are the value of `j`, which would increase to `2`, and since `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, it remains unchanged.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `dp` reflects the maximum length of divisible subsets, i is equal to len(nums), j is 2**
