Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `dp` is a list reflecting the maximum length of divisible subsets for elements in `nums`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.***
