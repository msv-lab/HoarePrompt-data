According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop iterates from 1 to the length of `nums` minus one. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently equal to `len(nums) - 1`, and `nums` contains at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `len(nums)`, and since `i` must be less than `len(nums)` for the loop to execute again, `nums` can contain at least 2 integers to support this condition, thus requiring that `len(nums)` is at least 3.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `dp` is a list reflecting the maximum length of divisible subsets for elements in `nums`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`**
