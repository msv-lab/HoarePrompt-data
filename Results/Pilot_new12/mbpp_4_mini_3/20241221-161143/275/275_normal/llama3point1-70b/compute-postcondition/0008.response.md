`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp` is initialized to a list of integers each equal to 1 with the length equal to `len(nums)`, the original value of `dp[i]` is 1. The value of `dp[j]` is also 1 since all values in `dp` are initialized to 1. Therefore, after the operation, `dp[i]` will be updated to the maximum of 1 and 1 + 1, which results in `dp[i]` being equal to 2.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 integers, `dp` is a list of integers with `dp[i]` now equal to 2, each previous element of `dp` is still 1, `i` is 1, `j` starts at 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.**
