To determine the output state, we analyze the operation that is being performed in the provided code snippet.

- The variable `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, which means `i` represents the number of elements in the list `nums`.
- The variable `j` is set to 2.
- `dp` is a list that contains values reflecting the maximum length of divisible subsets. 
- The command `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value at index `i` of `dp`. It sets `dp[i]` to the maximum of its current value (`dp[i]`) and the value of `dp[j] + 1`.

Since `j` is 2, we can denote the operation specifically: 

- `dp[j]` retrieves the value at index 2 of the `dp` list.
- We then compute `dp[j] + 1`, which increases the value at that index by 1.
- After that, `dp[i]` takes the maximum of its current value and the computed value.

As a result, `dp[i]` may be updated to a new value depending on the values at indices `i` and `j`.

There are no other variables being updated, but we retain all other contextual information from the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers.
- `dp` reflects the maximum length of divisible subsets, and it has been updated at index `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers; `dp` reflects the maximum length of divisible subsets; `i` is equal to len(nums); `j` is 2; `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i], dp[2] + 1)**.
