According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, so the loop has executed for `j` values of 0 and 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 2.

Additionally, since `i` remains at least 2, there are still elements in `nums` that can satisfy the loop condition. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be at least 3 because `nums` is guaranteed to have at least 3 integers, given its sorted nature.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2**
