According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0, since it iterates `i` times. In this case, `i` is already set to 1, which means the loop can execute once.

Additionally, we need to consider the values and states of the variables involved and their conditions before the loop starts. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order that must have at least 2 integers, `dp` is a list of integers each equal to 1 with the length equal to `len(nums)`, `i` is 1, `j` starts at 0**
