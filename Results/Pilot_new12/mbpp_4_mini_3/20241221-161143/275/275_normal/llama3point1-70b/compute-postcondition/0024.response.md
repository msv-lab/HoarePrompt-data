Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers and `dp` reflects the maximum length of divisible subsets. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, while `i` remains equal to `len(nums)` and `j` is 1.***
