According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `j`, which is iterated over the range defined by `i`. Since `i` is equal to `len(nums)` and `nums` is stated to have at least 3 integers, this means `i` is at least 3. Hence, the loop will execute for `j` values ranging from 0 to `i-1`. At the beginning of the first iteration, `j` will be 0.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `dp` is a list reflecting the maximum length of divisible subsets for elements in `nums`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 0**
