The initial state indicates that `nums` is a sorted list of integers. The code initializes a new list `dp`, where each element is set to 1 and the length of `dp` is equal to the length of `nums`. Therefore, if `nums` contains `n` integers, `dp` will become a list of `n` ones.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers each equal to 1 with the length equal to `len(nums)`**.
