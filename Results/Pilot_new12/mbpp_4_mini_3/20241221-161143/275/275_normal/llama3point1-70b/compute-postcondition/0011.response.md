The variable `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value `dp[i]` and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. The values of `nums`, `j`, and `dp` remain unchanged except for the updated value of `dp[i]`. The variable `j` is equal to `i`, so `dp[j]` will be the same as `dp[i]`. The effect on `dp[i]` will depend on its previous value and the value of `dp[i]` (since `j` is equal to `i`).

Letâ€™s denote the previous value of `dp[i]` as `dp[i]`_prev. Then, after the operation:

- If `dp[i]`_prev is greater than or equal to `dp[i] + 1`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.
- If `dp[i]`_prev is less than `dp[i] + 1`, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + 1`.

Thus, we can state that the new value of `dp[i]` will be the maximum of its previous state and `dp[i] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 integers; `j` is equal to `i`; `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i]_, dp[i]+1)**
