Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 integers. `dp` is a list where each element represents the longest divisible subset ending with the corresponding element in `nums`. `dp` could contain values that reflect the maximum length of divisible subsets formed from the elements of `nums`, ranging from 1 to the length of `nums`. Each value in `dp` is derived based on the divisibility condition checked during the iterations of the loop.**
