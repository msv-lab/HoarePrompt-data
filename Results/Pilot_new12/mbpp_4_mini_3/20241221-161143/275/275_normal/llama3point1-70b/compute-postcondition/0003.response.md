The code `nums.sort()` sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. The values of `nums` will be modified in place, and since `nums` is not empty, it will contain its elements arranged in sorted order. The states of the other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**
