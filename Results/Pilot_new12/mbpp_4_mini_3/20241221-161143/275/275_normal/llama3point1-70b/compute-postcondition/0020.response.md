In the provided code, `dp[i]` is being updated based on the values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`. Since `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, it implies that `i` is the index for the last element of `nums`. The condition tells us that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and therefore we can conclude that `dp[j] + 1` might yield a length for a divisible subset. 

The impact of the code:
1. We need to find the maximum value between the current value of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, and this maximum value will be assigned to `dp[i]`. 
2. The previous value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged unless a higher value is computed.

Given the conditions above, the output state will include the updated `dp[i]` as well as the unchanged dependencies from the initial state. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `dp` is a list reflecting the maximum length of divisible subsets for elements in `nums`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to max(`dp[i]`, `dp[j] + 1`).**
