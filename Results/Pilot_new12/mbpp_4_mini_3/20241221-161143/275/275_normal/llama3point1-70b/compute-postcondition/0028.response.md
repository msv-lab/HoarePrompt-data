Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `dp` reflects the maximum length of divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` has iterated through all indices from 0 to `i-1`. The final state of `dp[i]` indicates the maximum length of a divisible subset that can be formed with the element `nums[i]` and previous elements in `nums`.**
