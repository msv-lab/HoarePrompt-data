According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1, so that there is at least one valid index for `i` starting from 1. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` will be updated, but it is initialized to a list where each element is 1. 

For the loop to execute:
- `nums` must have at least 2 integers (which ensures that `len(nums) > 1`).
- At the start of the loop, `i` will be 1. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order that must have at least 2 integers, `dp` is a list of integers each equal to 1 with the length equal to `len(nums)`, `i` is 1**
