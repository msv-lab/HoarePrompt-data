The statement `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` implies that the value at index `i` of the list `dp` is being updated. The value assigned to `dp[i]` will be the greater of the current value at `dp[i]` or the value at `dp[j]` plus 1. 

Since `i` is at least 3 and `j` is 2, `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` can have specific values, but we only know the index they reference. We don't have their previous values provided in this scenario. Therefore, `dp[i]` will become either its original value or the value at `dp[j]` incremented by 1.

The impact of the code is therefore on `dp[i]`, which is updated based on its current value and the value at `dp[j]+1`. The values of `nums`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is now the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
