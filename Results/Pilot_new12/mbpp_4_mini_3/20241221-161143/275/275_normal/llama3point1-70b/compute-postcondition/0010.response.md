According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the index variable `j` in relation to `i`. Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i - 1`, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 integers, and we are considering the state after the last iteration of the loop, where `j` has reached its maximum value of `i - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `i`. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 integers, `j` is equal to `i`, and `dp` remains unchanged**.
