The statement `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` indicates that the value of `dp[i]` is being updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. The specific values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` depend on the context, but `i` is at least 2. 

Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, it's implied that the values in `dp` are related to the lengths of subsequences or similar metrics derived from `nums`. The previous values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` are not specified, so we note that they can change.

Splitting this down further, after the execution of the statement, `dp[i]` will be either its original value or `dp[j] + 1`, depending on which is greater. The state of other variables remains unchanged unless otherwise stated by the context of how `dp` is initially defined.

Given that `i` is at least 2, it implies there's a valid index in `dp`. Hence, the output reflects the potential change in `dp[i]`. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers; `i` is at least 2; `dp[i]` is updated to the larger value of `dp[i]` or `dp[j] + 1`.**
