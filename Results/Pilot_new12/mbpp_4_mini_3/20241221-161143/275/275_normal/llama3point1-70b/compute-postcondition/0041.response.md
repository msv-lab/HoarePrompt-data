Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending with the corresponding element in `nums`. `dp` contains values reflecting the maximum length of divisible subsets formed from the elements of `nums`, ranging from 1 to the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least one integer, `dp` will also have a corresponding entry for that integer. If `nums` is empty, `dp` will be an empty list.**
