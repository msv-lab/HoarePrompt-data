The code updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j]` plus one. The previous values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` have to be factored in to determine the new value for `dp[i]`. 

Given that `dp` reflects the maximum lengths of divisible subsets, the program will only potentially increase the length at `dp[i]` by checking against `dp[j]` incremented by 1.

Since `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, it refers to the first index outside the bounds of `nums`'s indices, while `j` is 1.

Therefore, the output will depend on how `dp[1]` influences `dp[len(nums)]` (which is an out-of-bounds index unless `dp` accommodates it). Assuming `dp` is large enough to accommodate `i`, we need to reflect the assignment.

Let's denote:
- `current_dp_i` as the previous value of `dp[i]`
- `current_dp_j` as the value of `dp[1]`.

Thus, the new value will be `max(current_dp_i, current_dp_j + 1)`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `dp` is updated at index `i` to be `max(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `j` is 1.**
