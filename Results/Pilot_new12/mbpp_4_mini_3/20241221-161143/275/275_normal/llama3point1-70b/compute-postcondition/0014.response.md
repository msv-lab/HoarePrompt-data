In the provided code snippet, `dp[i]` is being updated to the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`. The initial state indicates that `j` is equal to `i` (thus `j` is not a different index), and `dp` will remain unchanged in other aspects. Therefore, both `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` refer to the same index `i`, and the calculation simplifies to:

`dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i] + 1)`

This means that `dp[i]` is being compared to itself plus one. Since `dp[i] + 1` is always greater than `dp[i]`, `dp[i]` will be updated to this new value, effectively incrementing it by 1.

Thus, the effect on the state will be:

- `dp[i]` will increase by 1, while `nums` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `j` remains equal to `i`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 integers, `j` is equal to `i`, `dp[i]` is increased by 1**.
