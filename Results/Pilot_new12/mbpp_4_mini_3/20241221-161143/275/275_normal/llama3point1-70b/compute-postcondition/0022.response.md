According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by the variable `i`. Given that `i` is equal to `len(nums)` at the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to increment by 1.

At the last iteration, `j` was 0, so for the loop to execute again, it will increment to 1 during the next iteration. However, since `i` is already equal to `len(nums)`, the range for `j` will not satisfy the continuation condition, which is `j < i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be increased or the condition involving `j` must be modified.

Since `i` is `len(nums)`, further execution of the loop based on the current state is not possible again with the current `nums` configuration. Hence, the state needs to imply that for any continued execution from the current state, the loop needs an adjustment.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `dp` is a list reflecting the maximum length of divisible subsets for elements in `nums`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 1**
