Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `dp` is a list reflecting the maximum length of divisible subsets for elements in `nums`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, and `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.***
