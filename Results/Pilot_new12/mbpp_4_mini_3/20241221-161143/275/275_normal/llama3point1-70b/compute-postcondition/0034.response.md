According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop is designed to iterate over `j` from 0 to `i-1`. Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be sufficient.

At the end of the last iteration, we don't have the value of `i`, but we know that `j` ranged from 0 to `i-1`. Hence, for the next iteration, `j` will take the value of `i-1`, and the loop will need `j` to be less than `i`, meaning `i` must be greater than `j`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be at least 1 greater than `j`, and since `nums` has at least 3 integers, `i` must be at least 2.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 3 integers, `i` must be at least 2.**
