The function accepts a list of integers, `nums`. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. If `nums` contains elements, it sorts the list and constructs a dynamic programming array `dp`. This array keeps track of the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in the sorted list. The function then returns the maximum value from this `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest divisible subset from the numbers in `nums`. The function effectively identifies how many numbers in `nums` can be divided by one another to form the longest subset where each number is a multiple of a preceding one.
