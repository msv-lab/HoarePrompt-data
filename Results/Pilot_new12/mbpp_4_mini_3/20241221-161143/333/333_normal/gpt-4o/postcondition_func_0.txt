The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks whether these characters are balanced â€” meaning every opening character has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing character. The function uses a stack to track unmatched opening characters. After processing all characters in the string, it returns True if all characters are balanced (indicated by an empty stack) and returns False if any characters are unmatched or if the order of characters is incorrect. The function also correctly handles edge cases such as an empty input string, where it will return True since there are no unmatched characters. Missing functionality could include further validation of the input type (i.e., ensuring `expr` is indeed a string), but the current implementation does not include such checks.
