According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the remaining characters in `expr`. If there are characters left in `expr`, the loop will continue to iterate. At the end of the last iteration, `expr` contains characters that have yet to be processed. The loop will take the next character from `expr` and assign it to `char`. 

To execute one more time, we must ensure that `expr` still has characters remaining for the loop to continue. Since `char` is assigned in each iteration, we can conclude that if `char` is being processed, `expr` must have at least one character left and `char` will be the next character in `expr`.

State: **`expr` contains characters remaining, `char` is the next character in `expr`**
