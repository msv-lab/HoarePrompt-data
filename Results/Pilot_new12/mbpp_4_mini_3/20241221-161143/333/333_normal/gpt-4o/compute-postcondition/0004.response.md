The `char` variable is appended to the `stack` list. Since `stack` was initially empty, after appending, `stack` will contain one element: `char`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` contains `char`, `char` is the first character in `expr`, and `char` is present in the values of `matching_pairs.**
