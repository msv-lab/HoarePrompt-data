The `char` variable is appended to the `stack`, implying a change in the content of `stack`. However, the previous content of `stack` is not mentioned, so we can only denote that `char` is added to it. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `expr` contains characters remaining, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `char` is appended to `stack`.

Output State: **`expr` contains characters remaining, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `char` is appended to `stack`**.
