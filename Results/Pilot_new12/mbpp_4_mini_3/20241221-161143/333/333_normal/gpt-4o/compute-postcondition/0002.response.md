According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `expr` string. For the loop to run, `expr` must contain at least 1 character. Since `stack` is initialized as an empty list before the loop begins, it is valid at this point. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `expr` must not be an empty string, and `char` will take on the value of each character in `expr`, starting with the first character. 

State: **`expr` must not be an empty string, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in `expr`**
