Postcondition: ***`expr` contains characters remaining. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, `char` is added to `stack`. If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, and `stack` is empty or the last character popped from `stack` does not match the corresponding character for `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function proceeds without returning anything, maintaining the characters in `stack` that correspond to unmatched pairs.***
