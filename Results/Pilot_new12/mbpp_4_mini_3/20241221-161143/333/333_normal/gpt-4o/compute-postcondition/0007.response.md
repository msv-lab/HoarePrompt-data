Postcondition: ***`expr` must not be an empty string, `stack` is an empty list that may still contain elements, `char` is the first character in `expr`, `char` is not a value in `matching_pairs`, and `char` is a value in `matching_pairs`. The current state of `stack` is empty, or the last element popped from `stack` did not match `matching_pairs[char]`.***
