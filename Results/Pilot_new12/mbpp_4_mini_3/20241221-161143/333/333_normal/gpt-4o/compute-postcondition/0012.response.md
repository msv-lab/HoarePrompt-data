According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more characters in the `expr` string. At the end of the last iteration, `expr` is a non-empty string, indicating that it contains at least one character remaining. The variable `char` represents the current character being processed from `expr`.

Specifically, if `stack` is empty, we are guaranteed to keep processing until all characters in `expr` are handled. Since we've established that `expr` is non-empty, we need to determine the next character for `char`. If we have gone through at least one character already, we can assume that the index has progressed. 

If `char` was present in `matching_pairs`, then we would have pushed it onto the stack. If it wasn't present, then we are assuming that `stack` contained a character that matches the corresponding closing character specified by `matching_pairs[char]`.

For `char` to be set correctly for the next iteration of the loop, it simply needs to be assigned to the next character in `expr`. If we have handled the first character in the previous iteration, the current character `char` would be the next one in line from `expr`. 

Thus, the stack's content and the character to be evaluated in the next iteration must reflect this adjustment.

State: **`expr` contains characters remaining, `stack` is either the same or contains characters corresponding to unmatched pairs, `char` is the next character in `expr`.**
