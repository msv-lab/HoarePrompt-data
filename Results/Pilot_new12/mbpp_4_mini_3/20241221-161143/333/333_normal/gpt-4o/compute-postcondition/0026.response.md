The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expr`. `expr` is a string containing characters that may include parentheses, brackets, and braces. The function evaluates the string to determine if the characters are balanced according to the matching pairs. 

- If the current character does not match the expected value in the stack, the function returns `False`.
- The function may return `False` in other unspecified cases as well.
- Finally, the function returns `True` if the stack is empty, indicating that all characters in `expr` are balanced. If the stack contains unmatched opening characters, it returns `False`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `expr` containing characters like parentheses, brackets, and braces, and to check if these characters are balanced, returning `True` if they are and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter expr, and returns True if the characters in expr are balanced, or returns False if they are not balanced.**
