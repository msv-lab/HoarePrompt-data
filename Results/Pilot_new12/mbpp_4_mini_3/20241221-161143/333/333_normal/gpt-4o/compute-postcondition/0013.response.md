The code `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the `stack`. Given that `stack` is either the same as it was or contains characters corresponding to unmatched pairs, this operation will add `char` to `stack`, potentially increasing its length by one or adding a new unmatched character.

The initial conditions indicate that `expr` contains characters that remain, and `char` is the next character. There are no other operations modifying `expr` or affecting the validity of `stack`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `char` has been added to `stack`, which may contain characters that are already there depending on the state prior to this operation.

Output State: **`expr` contains characters remaining, `stack` now contains `char` added to its previous state, `char` is the next character in `expr`.**
