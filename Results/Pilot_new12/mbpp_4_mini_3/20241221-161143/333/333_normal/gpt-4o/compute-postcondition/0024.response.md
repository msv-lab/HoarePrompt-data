To analyze the output state after the complete execution of the loop, we need to see how `stack` interacts with `expr` based on the pairs of characters we are dealing with.

1. The loop iterates over each character in the `expr` string.
2. If a character is an opening character (i.e., in the values of `matching_pairs`), it gets appended to `stack`.
3. If it is a closing character (i.e., in the keys of `matching_pairs`), the loop checks if `stack` is empty or if the character on top of `stack` does not match the expected opening character. If either condition is true, the function returns `False` immediately, indicating an imbalance in the opening and closing characters.

For the output after all iterations of the loop:

- If `expr` is perfectly balanced (i.e., every opening character has a matching closing character), then after the loop, `stack` must be empty because all characters would have been matched and removed as valid pairs.
- If `expr` is not balanced, `stack` will contain the unmatched opening characters left over.

Moreover, if `expr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `stack` remains empty.

Considering these points, the output state after the loop's complete execution can be formulated as follows:

Output State: **if `expr` is non-empty, `stack` is empty if all characters are balanced; otherwise, `stack` contains the unmatched opening characters. If `expr` is empty, `stack` remains empty.**
