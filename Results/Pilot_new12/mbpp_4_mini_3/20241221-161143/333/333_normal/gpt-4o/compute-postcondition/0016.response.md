Postcondition: ***`expr` contains characters remaining and `stack` is either empty or contains characters corresponding to unmatched pairs. If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, and the `stack` is empty or the last character popped from `stack` does not match the corresponding character for `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function proceeds without returning anything.***
