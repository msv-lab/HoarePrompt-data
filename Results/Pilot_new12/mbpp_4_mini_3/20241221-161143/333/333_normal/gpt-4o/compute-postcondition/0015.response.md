Postcondition: ***`expr` contains characters remaining, `stack` is either empty or contains characters corresponding to unmatched pairs, and `char` is the next character in `expr`. If `stack` is empty or the last character popped from `stack` does not match the corresponding character for `char` in `matching_pairs`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything.***
