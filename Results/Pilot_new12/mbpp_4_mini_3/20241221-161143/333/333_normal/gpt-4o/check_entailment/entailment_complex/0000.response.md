Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement by checking if a given expression containing parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced. Hereâ€™s why the program is correct and meets all requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr`, which is stated to include characters such as parentheses, brackets, and braces. The program correctly processes this input.

2. **Use of Stack**: The implementation employs a stack, which is an appropriate data structure for keeping track of unmatched opening characters, aligning with the common approach to solve balance checking problems. 

3. **Matching Character Logic**: The function utilizes a dictionary `matching_pairs` to define matching pairs for closing and opening characters. This ensures that the program checks for the correct corresponding closing character whenever it encounters an opening character.

4. **Balance Check**: During the iteration over the characters in `expr`, the function appends opening characters to the stack and checks against the top of the stack when a closing character is encountered. If there is a mismatch or if the stack is empty when it should not be (indicating an unmatched closing character), it returns `False`.

5. **Final Stack Check**: After processing all characters, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is empty, it indicates that all opening characters had matching closing characters in the correct order, thus returning `True`. If any unmatched opening characters remain in the stack, it returns `False`.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles various edge cases, including an empty string input, which is interpreted as balanced (returns `True`).

The assertions provided also reflect expected outputs correctly, demonstrating that the function behaves as intended for various cases.

Overall, the program comprehensively addresses the requirements laid out in the problem description to accurately determine if an expression is balanced or not. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
