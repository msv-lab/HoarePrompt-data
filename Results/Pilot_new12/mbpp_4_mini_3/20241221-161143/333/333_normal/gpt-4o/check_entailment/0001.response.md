To determine the correctness of the provided program that checks if a given expression is balanced, let's analyze the code and the problem description thoroughly.

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
    return stack == []
```

### Problem Description:
The program needs to check if a given expression (containing parentheses, brackets, and braces) is balanced. This means:
1. Every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
2. Brackets must close in the reverse order of how they were opened.

### Evaluating Correctness:
Let's walk through the critical parts of the program and see if it handles all possible test cases:

1. **Opening Brackets**: Each time an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`) is encountered, it is added to a stack.
2. **Closing Brackets**: When a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`) is found, the program checks if there's a matching opening bracket on the stack:
   - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the expected opening bracket, it returns `False`.
3. **Final Check**: At the end of the loop, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were matched properly.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Empty String**: The function should return `True` for an empty string `''`, as there are no unmatched brackets.
2. **Single Types**: Expressions like `'(', '[', '{'`, should return `False`.
3. **Unmatched Closing**: The expression `'{()}'` should give `True`, but `'{[}'` should give `False`.
4. **Nested Brackets**: Complex nesting such as `'{[()()]}'` should return `True`.
5. **Mismatched pairs**: An expression like `'{(])}'` should return `False`.
6. **Excess Closing**: An expression such as `{[()]}` but with an extra `}` should return `False` (like `{[()]} }`).

### Discovering an Issue:
Upon examination, the program does not explicitly handle an empty string, which should technically return `True`. However, since it does not return a `False` for unmatched cases in terms of brackets, it should not introduce unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly manages the described scenarios and does not fail any of the balanced parenthesis checks when various test cases and edge conditions are considered, I conclude that it behaves as expected for a comprehensive range of inputs.

Correctness: **True**
