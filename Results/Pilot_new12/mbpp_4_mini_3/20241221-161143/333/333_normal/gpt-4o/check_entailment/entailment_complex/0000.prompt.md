You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string containing characters that may include parentheses, brackets, and braces.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: if `expr` is non-empty, `stack` is empty if all characters are balanced; otherwise, `stack` contains the unmatched opening characters. If `expr` is empty, `stack` remains empty.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if 'stack' is empty, indicating that all characters in 'expr' are balanced, or returns False if 'stack' contains unmatched opening characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks whether these characters are balanced â€” meaning every opening character has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing character. The function uses a stack to track unmatched opening characters. After processing all characters in the string, it returns True if all characters are balanced (indicated by an empty stack) and returns False if any characters are unmatched or if the order of characters is incorrect. The function also correctly handles edge cases such as an empty input string, where it will return True since there are no unmatched characters. Missing functionality could include further validation of the input type (i.e., ensuring `expr` is indeed a string), but the current implementation does not include such checks.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
