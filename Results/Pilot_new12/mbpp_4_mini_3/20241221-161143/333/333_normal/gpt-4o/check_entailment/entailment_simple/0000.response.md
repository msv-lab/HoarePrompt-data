Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` correctly checks if a given expression containing parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced, as required by the problem description. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an empty list called `stack`, which is used to keep track of unmatched opening characters.

2. **Matching Pairs**: It defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing characters (')', ']', '}') to their corresponding opening characters ('(', '[', '{'). This allows the program to easily identify whether a closing character corresponds correctly to the last unmatched opening character in the stack.

3. **Looping Through Characters**: The program iterates through each character in the input expression:
   - If the character is an opening character (one of '(', '[', '{'), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing character (one of ')', ']', '}'), it checks:
     - If the stack is empty (indicating that there is no matching opening character), it returns `False`.
     - If the stack is not empty, it pops the last opening character from the stack and checks if it matches with the current closing character using the `matching_pairs` dictionary. If it doesn't match, it returns `False`.

4. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, the program checks whether the stack is empty. If it is empty, it means all opening characters had matching closing characters, and thus it returns `True`. If the stack still contains opening characters, it returns `False`, indicating an imbalance.

5. **Assertions**: The program includes assertions to test its correctness with various expressions, ensuring that it returns the expected results.

Overall, the program appropriately handles all cases defined by the problem description and robustly determines whether the expression is balanced. This adherence to the requirements confirms its correctness.
