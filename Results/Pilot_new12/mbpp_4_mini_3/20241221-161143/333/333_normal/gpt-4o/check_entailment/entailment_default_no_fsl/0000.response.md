Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input string may contain characters other than parentheses, brackets, and braces. For example, the input `"{()}[{}]abc"` would lead to an incorrect assessment because the extra characters would not be ignored by the current logic, even though they don't affect the balance of the brackets. The function `func_1` can give the wrong result for such cases as it currently only considers specific characters defined within `matching_pairs`. 

Another edge case the program does not account for is an input consisting solely of unmatched closing characters, such as `"))))"`, which should return `False`, but the function would return `True` because the stack remains empty after popping operations.

Due to these limitations and lack of handling for additional characters, the program does not fulfil the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
