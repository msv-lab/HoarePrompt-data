Based on the provided analysis of the problem description, program functionality, and output hints, I have reviewed all aspects of the implementation.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` checks for balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces and details the mechanisms by which it achieves this. The explanation outlines how the function uses a stack to track unmatched opening characters and checks for proper pairings between opening and closing brackets.

The output hints further support the functionality by confirming that the function indeed checks if the expressions are balanced and handles edge cases like an empty input string appropriately, returning `True` in such a case.

Considering all of these points, the conclusion drawn in the original assessment—that the program is correct—is accurate. The program meets the problem description’s requirements, the logic is sound, and there are no identified failures in any of the specified scenarios. 

Thus, I maintain the original assessment. 

Final: **True**
