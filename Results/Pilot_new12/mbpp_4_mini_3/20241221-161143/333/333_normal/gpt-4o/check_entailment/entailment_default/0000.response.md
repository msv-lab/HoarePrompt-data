Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` aims to check if brackets (parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces) in the input string are balanced. While it correctly identifies balanced cases, there is a potential edge case where it may not work as expected. For instance, if the input string is `'{((())}[]'`, the current logic will return `False`. This is because it will pop from the stack without confirming if the last opening bracket matches the closing bracket, thus leading to incorrect tracking of unmatched characters. Additionally, the assertion tests provide a good indication of some balanced and unbalanced inputs, but the example `'{((())}[]'` is not covered, showing that the implementation cannot handle nested structures correctly in every scenario. Given these limitations, the function does not fulfill the problem requirements for every potential case.
