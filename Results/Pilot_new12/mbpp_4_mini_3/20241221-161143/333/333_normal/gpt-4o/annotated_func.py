#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string containing characters that may include parentheses, brackets, and braces.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: if `expr` is non-empty, `stack` is empty if all characters are balanced; otherwise, `stack` contains the unmatched opening characters. If `expr` is empty, `stack` remains empty.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if 'stack' is empty, indicating that all characters in 'expr' are balanced, or returns False if 'stack' contains unmatched opening characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks whether these characters are balanced â€” meaning every opening character has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing character. The function uses a stack to track unmatched opening characters. After processing all characters in the string, it returns True if all characters are balanced (indicated by an empty stack) and returns False if any characters are unmatched or if the order of characters is incorrect. The function also correctly handles edge cases such as an empty input string, where it will return True since there are no unmatched characters. Missing functionality could include further validation of the input type (i.e., ensuring `expr` is indeed a string), but the current implementation does not include such checks.
