You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression's brackets are balanced. 

Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Data Structure**: It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. This is appropriate for checking balanced expressions since most issues with balanced parentheses occur when encountering closing brackets that do not have corresponding opening brackets.

2. **Character Recognition**: The program checks for opening brackets and pushes them onto the stack. For closing brackets, it checks if the stack is empty (which would mean there is no corresponding opening bracket). If the stack is not empty, it pops the last opening bracket and checks if it matches the type of the closing bracket being processed.

3. **Final Check**: The function returns `True` only if the stack is empty at the end, indicating that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets.

The edge cases that are considered are:
- Expressions with no brackets (should return `True`).
- Expressions with mismatched brackets (should return `False`).
- Nested brackets (should be handled correctly).
- Different types of brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) are all handled.

Since the function processes all inputs correctly according to the problem description and does not miss any potential edge cases, it is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `stack` is empty if all brackets in `expression` are matched; otherwise, `stack` contains unmatched opening brackets. `expression` is processed completely.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if all brackets in 'expression' are matched, and False if there are unmatched opening brackets in 'stack'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
