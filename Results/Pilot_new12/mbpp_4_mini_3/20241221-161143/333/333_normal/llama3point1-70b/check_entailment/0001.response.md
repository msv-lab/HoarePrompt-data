Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression's brackets are balanced. 

Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Data Structure**: It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. This is appropriate for checking balanced expressions since most issues with balanced parentheses occur when encountering closing brackets that do not have corresponding opening brackets.

2. **Character Recognition**: The program checks for opening brackets and pushes them onto the stack. For closing brackets, it checks if the stack is empty (which would mean there is no corresponding opening bracket). If the stack is not empty, it pops the last opening bracket and checks if it matches the type of the closing bracket being processed.

3. **Final Check**: The function returns `True` only if the stack is empty at the end, indicating that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets.

The edge cases that are considered are:
- Expressions with no brackets (should return `True`).
- Expressions with mismatched brackets (should return `False`).
- Nested brackets (should be handled correctly).
- Different types of brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) are all handled.

Since the function processes all inputs correctly according to the problem description and does not miss any potential edge cases, it is deemed correct.
