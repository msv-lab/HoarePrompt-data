Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` effectively checks if the given expression's brackets are balanced according to the problem description. 

1. **Data Structure**: The use of a stack is appropriate for managing opening brackets, which aligns with standard practices for solving problems involving balanced parentheses.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The function correctly identifies and processes both opening and closing brackets. It appropriately checks for unmatched closing brackets (returns `False` if encountered) and verifies that all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets when reaching the end of the expression (returns `True` if the stack is empty).

3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The function also accommodates various edge cases such as expressions without brackets (returning `True`), mismatched brackets (returning `False`), nested brackets, and different types of brackets. 

4. **Ignoring Non-bracket Characters**: The output hints mention that characters other than brackets are ignored. This aligns with the requirement that the function should only consider brackets when determining balance, providing additional assurance that the implementation meets the problem description.

Given these points, the functionality of the program aligns with the objectives specified in the problem description, and thus the original assessment can be confidently upheld.
