Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` fulfills the problem description by correctly checking if the given expression's brackets are balanced. The annotations provide clarity on how the program processes the input:

1. **State before the loop execution**: The program initializes a `stack` to keep track of opening brackets and prepares a dictionary of brackets, indicating that it is set up correctly for the task.

2. **Processing each character**: The loop effectively handles both opening and closing brackets. The program correctly pushes opening brackets onto the stack and checks for matching closing brackets against the last opened bracket.

3. **State after the loop execution**: The condition `return not stack` signifies that if the stack is empty, all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly returns `True` for strings without brackets and `False` for mismatched or unbalanced brackets. The program also safely ignores any non-bracket characters within the string, which is consistent with the problem description.

Overall, the program adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the problem description, correctly utilizing the stack-based approach for balanced bracket checking. Therefore, the assessment of correctness remains valid.
