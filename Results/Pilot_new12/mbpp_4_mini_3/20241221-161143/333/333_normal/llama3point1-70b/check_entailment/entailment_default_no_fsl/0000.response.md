Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a check for balanced brackets in an expression. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of unmatched opening brackets and handles closing brackets appropriately. The logic ensures that for every closing bracket encountered, there is a matching opening bracket and that they are in the correct order.

The program ignores characters in the expression that are not brackets, which aligns with the output hints and the problem description. Since the problem states that the input will be valid, there are no concerns regarding invalid input handling.

Overall, the function performs correctly for all potential cases related to the balancing of brackets, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description.
