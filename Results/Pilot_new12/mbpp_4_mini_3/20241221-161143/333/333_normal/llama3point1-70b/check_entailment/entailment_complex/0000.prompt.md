You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `stack` is empty if all brackets in `expression` are matched; otherwise, `stack` contains unmatched opening brackets. `expression` is processed completely.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if all brackets in 'expression' are matched, and False if there are unmatched opening brackets in 'stack'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` that contains parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks whether all the opening brackets in the expression have matching closing brackets in the correct order. The function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the unmatched opening brackets. If it encounters a closing bracket without a corresponding unmatched opening bracket on the stack, it returns `False`. Additionally, if there are any unmatched opening brackets remaining in the stack after processing the entire expression, it also returns `False`. Conversely, if all brackets are matched correctly, it returns `True`. The function does not account for characters in the expression that are not brackets, meaning they are effectively ignored.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
