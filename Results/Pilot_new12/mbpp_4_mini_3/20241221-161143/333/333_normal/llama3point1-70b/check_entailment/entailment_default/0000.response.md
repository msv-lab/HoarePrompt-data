Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic for checking if an expression with brackets is balanced. The function uses a stack to track opening brackets and checks for matching closing brackets. It pushes opening brackets onto the stack and, for closing brackets, it checks if thereâ€™s a matching opening bracket on the stack. If there is a mismatch or if a closing bracket is encountered without a corresponding opening bracket, the function returns `False`. Finally, it checks if there are any unmatched opening brackets left in the stack, returning `False` if there are, and `True` if all brackets have been matched correctly.

The output hints confirm that the function ignores non-bracket characters, which aligns with the function's logic. Hence, the function adheres to the problem description, handling all potential cases accurately, including ensuring that bracket pairs are well-formed.

Correctness: **True**.
