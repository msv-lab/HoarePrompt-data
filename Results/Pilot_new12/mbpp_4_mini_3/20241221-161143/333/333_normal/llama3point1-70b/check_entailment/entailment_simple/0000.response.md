Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if a given expression containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces is balanced. Here's an explanation of why the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Initialization of Data Structures**: The program initializes an empty list called `stack` to keep track of the opening brackets encountered.

2. **Mapping of Brackets**: A dictionary named `brackets` is used to map opening brackets (`(`, `{`, `[`) to their corresponding closing brackets (`)`, `}`, `]`). This allows the program to easily check for correct pairings.

3. **Iterating Through the Expression**: The program loops through each character in the input `expression`:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it exists in the `brackets` dictionary), it is pushed onto the `stack`.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it is a value in the `brackets` dictionary), the program checks if the `stack` is not empty and if the last opening bracket in the `stack` matches the current closing bracket. If there is a mismatch or if the `stack` is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, the function returns `False` immediately.

4. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, the program checks if the `stack` is empty. An empty `stack` indicates that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, and therefore the expression is balanced. If there are any unmatched opening brackets left in the `stack`, the function returns `False`.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the expression is balanced and `False` otherwise.

Overall, the program contains appropriate logic to ensure that all types of brackets are matched correctly in the order they appear. Therefore, it accurately implements the requirement of checking whether the given expression is balanced. The program handles all specified scenarios defined in the problem description.

Given that it fulfills the requirements outlined, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
