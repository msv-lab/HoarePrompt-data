Correctness: **True**.

The provided code correctly checks if an expression containing brackets is balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and matches them with closing brackets as it iterates over the characters in the expression. 

1. If an opening bracket is found, it is added to the stack.
2. If a closing bracket is encountered, the program checks if the stack is empty (which would indicate an unbalanced expression) or if the top of the stack (the last added opening bracket) matches the corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket. If either condition fails, it returns `False`.
3. Finally, if the stack is empty at the end, it returns `True`, indicating that all opening brackets have been matched.

The implementation handles various cases, including:
- Nested brackets
- Different types of brackets (round, curly, square)
- Empty strings (which are considered balanced)

I cannot find any example where the code fails to check if the expression is balanced according to the problem description, so it is correct.
