Correctness: **True**

The annotated program implements a function `func_1` that checks if a given expression containing parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced. Here’s how it meets the problem description:

1. **Matching Opening and Closing Brackets**: The function utilizes a stack to keep track of unmatched opening brackets. As it processes the expression character by character, it pushes opening brackets onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if there is a matching opening bracket on the stack. If there isn’t, the function returns `False`.

2. **Empty Stack Check**: After iterating through the entire expression, if the stack is empty, it indicates that all opening brackets have been matched with their respective closing brackets, so it returns `True`. If there are still unmatched opening brackets left in the stack, it returns `False`.

3. **Correct Order**: The function correctly ensures that brackets are matched in the correct order, adhering to the nested structure that brackets must follow in balanced expressions.

4. **Handling Non-bracket Characters**: The program effectively ignores any non-bracket characters in the expression. This means it only focuses on parentheses, brackets, and braces, thereby following the requirements of the problem description.

Overall, the implementation handles the task of checking for balanced expressions accurately and efficiently, fulfilling the requirements set by the problem description.
