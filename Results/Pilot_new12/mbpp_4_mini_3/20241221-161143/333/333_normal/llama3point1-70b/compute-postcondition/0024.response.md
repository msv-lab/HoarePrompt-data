To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we can draw conclusions based on the loop code and the implications of the original state.

1. The loop iterates through each character in the `expression` string.
2. If a character is an opening bracket, it gets added to the `stack`.
3. If a character is a closing bracket, the loop checks if there is a corresponding opening bracket in the `stack`. If there is, it pops the opening bracket. If there isn't, it would return `False`.

Given these conditions, we can summarize the possible values of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- If `expression` contains correctly matched brackets, the `stack` will be empty after processing all characters, signifying that all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets.
- If `expression` contains unmatched brackets or if there are closing brackets without corresponding opening brackets present, the loop will return `False`, and the state will indicate that the `stack` remains non-empty.

Considering these points leads us to conclude the final output state based on the possible scenarios:

Output State: **`stack` is empty if all brackets in `expression` are matched; otherwise, `stack` contains unmatched opening brackets. `expression` is processed completely.**
