The variable `stack` is initialized as an empty list. There are no previous values of `stack` to consider since it is being set for the first time. The other variable, `expression`, remains unchanged in this context and retains its initial string content. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `stack` while the `expression` remains a string containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces. 

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces, `stack` is an empty list.**
