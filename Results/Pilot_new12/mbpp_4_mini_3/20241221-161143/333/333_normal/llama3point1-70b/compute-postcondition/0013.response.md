The code `stack.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the `stack`. Given that `stack` is initially an empty list, after the execution of the code, `stack` will contain the single character that was appended. The variable `char` retains its value as the next character in the non-empty `expression`, but `stack` will now be a list containing that character.

Output State: **`stack` is a list containing the character `char`, `char` is the next character in the non-empty `expression`**
