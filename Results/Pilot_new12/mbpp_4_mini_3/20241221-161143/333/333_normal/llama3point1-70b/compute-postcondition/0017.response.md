Postcondition: ***`stack` is an empty list initially. If `char` is in `brackets`, then `stack` contains the character `char`. If `char` is not in `brackets`, then `stack` remains empty; if `char` is in `brackets.values()` and `stack` is empty or the character corresponding to the popped element from `stack` does not match `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the program continues executing without an explicit return value.***
