Postcondition: ***`stack` is still an empty list, `expression` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces, the first character `char` of `expression` is not in `brackets`, `char` is a value from the `brackets.values()`, and either the `stack` was empty or the last element popped from the `stack` corresponds to the matching opening bracket for `char`.***
