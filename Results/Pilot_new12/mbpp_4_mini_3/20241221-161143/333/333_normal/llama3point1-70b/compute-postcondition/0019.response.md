The code `stack.append(char)` appends the variable `char` to the `stack` list. The initial state indicates that `stack` is an empty list, and since `expression` must have at least one more character to process, it means that `char` is defined and is a valid character from `expression`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`stack` contains the character `char`, `expression` must have at least 1 more character left to process**.
