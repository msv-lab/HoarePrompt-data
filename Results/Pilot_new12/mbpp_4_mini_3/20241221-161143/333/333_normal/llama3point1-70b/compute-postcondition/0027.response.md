Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` that contains parentheses, brackets, and braces. It checks whether all the opening brackets in the expression have matching closing brackets in the correct order. The function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the unmatched opening brackets. If it encounters a closing bracket without a corresponding unmatched opening bracket on the stack, it returns `False`. Additionally, if there are any unmatched opening brackets remaining in the stack after processing the entire expression, it also returns `False`. Conversely, if all brackets are matched correctly, it returns `True`. The function does not account for characters in the expression that are not brackets, meaning they are effectively ignored.**
