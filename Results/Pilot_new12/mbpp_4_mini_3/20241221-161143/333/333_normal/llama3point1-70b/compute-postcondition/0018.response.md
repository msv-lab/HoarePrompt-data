According to the code, the loop execution relies on the `expression` variable. If the loop can execute again, it implies there are more characters to process in `expression`. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` is an empty list. If the next `char` in `expression` is encountered, it will affect the state of `stack` based on whether the character is in `brackets` or not.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to acknowledge that there must be another character in `expression` for `char` as well as the current state of the stack. If there is a next character, we can infer that the `stack` for this next iteration remains empty or it follows the logic established by the previous iteration regarding matching brackets.

For the next iteration, if there are more characters to process, we can denote that there are at least two characters to ensure the state can increment for another loop execution. 

State: **`stack` is an empty list, `expression` must have at least 1 more character left to process**.
