Postcondition: ***`stack` is an empty list and `expression` must have at least 1 more character left to process. If `char` is in brackets, then `stack` contains the character `char`. If `char` is among the closing brackets and `stack` is empty or if the top of `stack` does not match the corresponding closing bracket of `char`, the function returns False due to unmatched brackets.***
