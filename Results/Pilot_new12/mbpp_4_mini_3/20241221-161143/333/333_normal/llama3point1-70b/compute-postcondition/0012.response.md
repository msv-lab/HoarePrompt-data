According to the code, the loop will continue iterating as long as there are characters left in the `expression` string. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` is an empty list, and we know `expression` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to take into account the next character in `expression` that will be processed. Since `stack` remains empty and `expression` is non-empty, it suggests that there are still characters to be processed within the string. The character `char` will take the next character from `expression`, which has not been detailed here, so we cannot specify its exact value.

To summarize, the `stack` remains empty, but `char` will move to the next character in `expression`, which is dependent on its remaining content.

State: **`stack` is an empty list, `char` is the next character in the non-empty `expression`**
