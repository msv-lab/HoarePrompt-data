Postcondition: ***`stack` is an empty list, and `expression` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces. If `char` is one of the brackets, then `stack` contains `char`. If `char` is a value from the `brackets.values()`, then either `stack` remains empty, or the last element popped from `stack` corresponds to the matching opening bracket for `char`. If `char` is not in `brackets.values()`, the `stack` remains unchanged.***
