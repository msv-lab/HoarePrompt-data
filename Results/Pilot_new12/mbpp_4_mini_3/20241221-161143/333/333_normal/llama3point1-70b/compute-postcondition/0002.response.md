According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expression`. For the loop to run, `expression` must be a non-empty string, as the loop iterates over each character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` should contain characters that have been processed. Since `stack` starts as an empty list, it will be updated during the iterations. Thus, for the loop to be executed, `expression` must not be an empty string.

State: **`stack` is an empty list, `expression` must be a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces, `char` is the first character of `expression`**
