The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expression`. `expression` is a string containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces. The function evaluates the `expression` for balanced brackets and returns:

- In Case 1, the function returns `False` indicating that the expression does not have a matching preceding bracket for the given character from the expression.
- In Case 2, the function returns `False`.
- In Case 3, the function returns `False` since there is no further processing with the current state of 'stack' being an empty list and 'expression' having at least 1 more character left.
- In Case 4, the function returns `True` if all brackets in 'expression' are matched, and it returns `False` if there are unmatched opening brackets in 'stack'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `expression` and determine whether the brackets in that expression are properly matched or not. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` and returns `False` for unmatched brackets or incomplete evaluations, and returns `True` if all brackets in `expression` are matched.**
