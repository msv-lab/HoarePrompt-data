The operation `stack.append(char)` adds the variable `char` to the `stack` list. Since `stack` is initially an empty list and `char` is the first character of the `expression`, which is also guaranteed to be one of the characters in `brackets`, the state of the `stack` will now contain that specific character.

The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`stack` contains `char`, `expression` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, and/or braces, `char` is the first character of `expression`, and `char` is one of the characters in `brackets`.**
