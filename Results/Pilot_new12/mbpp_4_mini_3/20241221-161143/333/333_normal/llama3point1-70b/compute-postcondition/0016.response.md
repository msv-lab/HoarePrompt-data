Postcondition: ***`stack` is an empty list and `char` is the next character in the non-empty `expression`. If `char` is in `brackets.values()` and `stack` is empty or the character corresponding to the popped element from `stack` does not match `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the program continues executing without a specified return value.***
