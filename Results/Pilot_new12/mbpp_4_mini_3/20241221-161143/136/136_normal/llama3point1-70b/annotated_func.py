#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where the keys are of any hashable type and the values are integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 'd' where the values are integers that are greater than or equal to 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are of any hashable type and values are integers, along with an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the corresponding values are greater than or equal to `n`. If `d` is empty or if no values in `d` meet the condition, the returned dictionary will also be empty. The function does not modify the original dictionary `d` but creates a new one based on the specified filtering criteria.
