You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
Program:
```
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the functionality to filter a dictionary based on the condition that its values must be greater than or equal to the integer `n`. It uses dictionary comprehension to iterate over all key-value pairs in the input dictionary `d` and correctly includes only those entries where the value meets the specified criterion. Since there are no edge cases or potential inputs where the logic fails, such as handling empty dictionaries or values that match `n`, the implementation is valid for all possible cases outlined in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where the keys are of any hashable type and the values are integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 'd' where the values are integers that are greater than or equal to 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are of any hashable type and values are integers, along with an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the corresponding values are greater than or equal to `n`. If `d` is empty or if no values in `d` meet the condition, the returned dictionary will also be empty. The function does not modify the original dictionary `d` but creates a new one based on the specified filtering criteria.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
