Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` meets the requirements set out in the problem description. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Input Specifications**: The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the keys can be of any hashable type, and the values are guaranteed to be integers. It also accepts an integer `n`. This matches the input specifications outlined in the problem description.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over all key-value pairs in the dictionary `d`. For each pair, it checks if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the condition is met, that key-value pair is included in the new dictionary. This directly corresponds to the requirement of filtering the dictionary to include only the entries with values greater than or equal to `n`.

3. **Correctness of Output**: The function returns a new dictionary that contains only those entries that meet the filtering criteria. If no entries meet the criteria, or if the input dictionary `d` is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description.

4. **Non-modifying**: The original dictionary `d` is not modified, which is consistent with the requirement to produce a new dictionary based on the filtering conditions.

5. **Assumptions on Input Validity**: The explanation mentions that valid inputs are assumed, which simplifies the verification process since the function does not need to handle erroneous inputs.

Thus, the program correctly implements the specifications outlined in the problem description without any deviations or omissions.
