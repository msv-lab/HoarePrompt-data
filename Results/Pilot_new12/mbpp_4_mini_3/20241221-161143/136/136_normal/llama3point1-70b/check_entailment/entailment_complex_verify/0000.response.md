Final: **True** 

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program successfully implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement, effectively filtering a dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`. The annotations confirm this behavior, stating that the function takes a dictionary where values are integers and filters these values according to the specified condition. They also clarify that if no values meet the criteria, an empty dictionary is returned, which aligns with the expected behavior detailed in the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is confirmed to be correct.
