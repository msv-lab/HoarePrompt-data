Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and filters the dictionary to retain only the entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

Here's why the code is correct in every potential case:

1. **Empty Dictionary**: If `d` is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary, which is expected behavior.
2. **No Values Meeting Criteria**: If no values in `d` are greater than or equal to `n`, the function will again return an empty dictionary, consistent with the requirement.
3. **Valid Input Types**: The function is designed to handle dictionaries with hashable keys and integer values, as stated in the output hints.
4. **Non-modifying Behavior**: The function indeed creates a new dictionary based on filtering criteria, ensuring that the original dictionary is not altered.

Given that these points cover all potential cases outlined in the problem description, the function behaves correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
