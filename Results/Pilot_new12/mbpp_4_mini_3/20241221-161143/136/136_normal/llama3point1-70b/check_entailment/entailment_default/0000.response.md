The provided program accurately meets the problem description requirements. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and then it constructs a new dictionary using a dictionary comprehension. It filters the items in `d` to include only those pairs `(k, v)` where the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Dictionary Comprehension Logic**: The use of `{k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}` correctly creates a new dictionary with only the key-value pairs that meet the specified condition `v >= n`.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If the input dictionary `d` is empty, the function returns an empty dictionary, which is correct as per the problem description.
   - The function returns a new dictionary rather than modifying the original dictionary `d`, which aligns with the requirement stated in the problem.

3. **Output Hints Consistency**: The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the program, including noting that if no values meet the condition, the returned dictionary will also be empty.

4. **Example Cases**: Scenarios such as an empty dictionary or values all below `n` yield the correct output of an empty dictionary, confirming the function's robustness.

Since the code accurately reflects the problem description and handles edge cases effectively without any missing logic, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
