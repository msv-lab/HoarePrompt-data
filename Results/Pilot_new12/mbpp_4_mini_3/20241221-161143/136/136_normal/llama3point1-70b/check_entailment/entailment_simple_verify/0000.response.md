Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the desired functionality described in the problem statement. The program uses dictionary comprehension to filter the input dictionary based on the condition that the values must be greater than or equal to the integer `n`, as specified. The annotations further confirm this by stating that the function returns a dictionary with key-value pairs from `d` where the values meet the specified condition. There are no edge cases that would cause the logic to fail under the given assumptions of valid input. Hence, the program meets the problem description requirements and behaves as expected according to the provided annotations.
