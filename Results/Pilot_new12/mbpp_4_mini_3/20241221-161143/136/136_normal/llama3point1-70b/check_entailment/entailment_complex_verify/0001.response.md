Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, as it correctly identifies that the program meets the problem description. The annotated code supports this by describing the function's behavior explicitly and confirming that it filters the dictionary according to the specified criteria of selecting entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. Furthermore, the program's handling of all logical scenarios (including empty dictionaries and various value comparisons) has been accounted for. The annotations reaffirm that the function operates as described, returning the correct results without modifying the original dictionary. Therefore, the program is correct, and the final assessment remains unchanged.
