Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The annotated version of the code supports this assessment, confirming that the function behaves as expected by filtering entries in the dictionary based on the condition where values are greater than or equal to the integer `n`. The annotations highlight the program's responsiveness to various valid inputs, thus reinforcing the validity of the original assessment. Overall, there is consistent alignment between the problem description, code behavior, and the reasoning provided in both the original assessment and the annotations.
