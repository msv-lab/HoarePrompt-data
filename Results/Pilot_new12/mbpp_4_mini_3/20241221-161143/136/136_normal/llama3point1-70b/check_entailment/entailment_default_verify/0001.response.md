Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and filters it based on the specified criteria of values being greater than or equal to `n`. The provided output hints align with the functionality of the program, confirming that it behaves as expected in various scenarios, including:

1. An empty dictionary returns an empty result.
2. All values being less than `n` also return an empty result.
3. Values exactly equal to `n` are included in the result.
4. Values greater than `n` are properly included as well.

Additionally, the program maintains the integrity of the original dictionary, creating a new dictionary without modifying the input. This comprehensive assessment, along with the confirmation from the output hints, supports the conclusion that the program functions correctly per the specified requirements.
