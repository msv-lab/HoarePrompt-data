Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1(d, n)` that takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. Using a dictionary comprehension, the function filters the original dictionary `d` to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. The function receives a dictionary `d` where the keys can be of any hashable type, and the values are expected to be integers.
2. It also receives an integer `n`.
3. The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` iterates over all key-value pairs in the dictionary `d`.
4. For each key-value pair, it checks if the value (`v`) is greater than or equal to `n`.
5. If the condition is true, it includes that key-value pair in the resulting dictionary.
6. Finally, the function returns this filtered dictionary.

The program handles all valid inputs according to the problem description, and since it assumes valid inputs (i.e., a dictionary and an integer), it meets the specified requirements without needing any additional error handling. Thus, the implementation adheres to the defined behavior in the problem description.
