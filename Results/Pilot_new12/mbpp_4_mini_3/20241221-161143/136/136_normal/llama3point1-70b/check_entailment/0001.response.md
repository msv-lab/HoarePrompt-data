Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and uses a dictionary comprehension to filter out only those entries in the dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. 

To verify this, consider the following:

1. If `d` is an empty dictionary (e.g., `{}`) and `n` is any integer (e.g., `5`), the output will be `{}`, which is correct as there are no entries to include.

2. If `d` contains entries where all values are less than `n`, e.g., `d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}` and `n = 3`, the result will be `{}`, which matches the expectation.

3. If `d` contains entries with values exactly equal to `n`, e.g., `d = {'x': 3, 'y': 5}` and `n = 3`, the result will include those entries with `v >= n`, leading to `{'x': 3, 'y': 5}`, which is correct.

4. If `d` contains entries with values greater than `n`, e.g., `d = {'p': 10, 'q': 2}` and `n = 5`, the result will be `{'p': 10}`, which correctly includes only the entries that meet the condition.

5. The program gracefully handles both integer and float values, so values like `{'a': 2.5, 'b': 3.2}` should behave as expected with a float `n`.

The logic is consistent and accounts for all logical scenarios laid out in the requirements. Since I could not find a single case where the program fails to meet the specified criteria, the program is indeed correct.
