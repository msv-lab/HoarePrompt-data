Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the functionality to filter a dictionary based on the condition that its values must be greater than or equal to the integer `n`. It uses dictionary comprehension to iterate over all key-value pairs in the input dictionary `d` and correctly includes only those entries where the value meets the specified criterion. Since there are no edge cases or potential inputs where the logic fails, such as handling empty dictionaries or values that match `n`, the implementation is valid for all possible cases outlined in the problem description.
