The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `d` and `n`. The parameter `d` is a dictionary where the keys are of any hashable type and the values are integers. The parameter `n` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the values are integers that are greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary `d` of hashable keys and integer values, along with an integer `n`, and return a filtered dictionary containing only those entries from `d` whose values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` with hashable keys and integer values, and an integer `n`, returning a dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n.**
