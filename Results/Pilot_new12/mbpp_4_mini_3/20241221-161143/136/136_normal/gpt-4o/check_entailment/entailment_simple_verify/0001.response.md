Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` appropriately implements the functionality as described in the problem statement: it filters the provided dictionary to include only those entries whose values are greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The assertions provided confirm that the function works correctly for multiple test cases, and the additional edge case provided demonstrates that the function also handles situations where no entries meet the criteria by returning an empty dictionary.

The annotations clearly indicate that the function is operating as intended, specifying the types of inputs and the expected behavior before and after the function call. Overall, the provided function meets the requirements of the problem description, and the annotations further confirm its correctness. Therefore, the final assessment remains as Original Assessment: **True**.
