Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the logic outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` effectively filters the input dictionary based on the threshold `n` specified. The annotations confirm that before the function call, the program operates with valid inputs and that the return statement correctly produces a new dictionary containing only those key-value pairs where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

Additionally, the provided assertions cover various thresholds, all of which yield the expected results. The annotations also clarify that even if there are no qualifying entries, the function correctly returns an empty dictionary. The entire reasoning provided in the original assessment aligns with the behavior illustrated in the annotations and the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is deemed correct and meets the necessary criteria.
