Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and it correctly filters the dictionary entries to include only those where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

Hereâ€™s how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Types**: The function accepts a dictionary for `d` and an integer for `n`, which matches the requirements specified in the problem description.
  
2. **Filtering Logic**: The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` effectively iterates over all key-value pairs in the dictionary and includes only those pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
  
3. **Output Format**: The output is also a dictionary, which is what the problem description requires.

The assertions included in the annotated program serve as test cases that confirm the function produces the expected output for various inputs, which further validates its correctness. Since all expected behaviors and outputs align with the problem description, the program is verified as correct.
