Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. This directly aligns with the problem description.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The line `return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` correctly creates a new dictionary by including only those key-value pairs from the input dictionary `d` where the values `v` are greater than or equal to the integer `n`. This means that if there are no entries that meet the condition, it will return an empty dictionary, which aligns with the expected behavior as specified in the description.

3. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the annotated program thoroughly test the function. They cover various scenarios:
   - When `n` is less than the values in the dictionary (expected to return multiple entries).
   - When `n` matches some values but is higher than others (expected to return only the qualifying entries).
   - When `n` is equal to the maximum value in the dictionary (expected to return only that entry).

4. **Edge Cases**: The overall description in the comments mentions that the function will handle edge cases such as an empty dictionary, which further assures its correctness given the assumption of valid input.

Therefore, the program adheres fully to the problem description, and it would always produce the correct output as specified in every tested case.
