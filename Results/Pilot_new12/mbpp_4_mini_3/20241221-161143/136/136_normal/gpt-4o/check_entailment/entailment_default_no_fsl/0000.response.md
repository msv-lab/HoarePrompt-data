Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of filtering a dictionary based on whether the values are greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The assertions provided test several scenarios:

1. When `n` is 170, the function returns entries with values `175`, `180`, and `190`, which is the expected output.
2. When `n` is 180, the function returns entries with values `180` and `190`, which is also correct.
3. When `n` is 190, the function returns the entry with the value `190`, which is accurate.

The output hints specify that the function should return an empty dictionary if no values meet the criteria, and the code correctly handles an empty dictionary or when all values are below `n` by using the same comprehension technique. Since all tested cases pass and the function behaves properly across these scenarios, it can be concluded that the solution meets the problem's requirements consistently without any edge cases failing. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
