Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the task of filtering a dictionary based on the values being greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`. The program passed all the provided assertions, confirming its correctness for those tested cases. Additionally, the output hints elaborate on the function's behavior, stating that it returns a new dictionary with the required filter and appropriately handles edge cases, such as returning an empty dictionary if no values meet the condition. 

Since all aspects of the problem description, the functionality of the code, and the output hints align with the original assessment of correctness, the final conclusion is that the program is indeed correct.
