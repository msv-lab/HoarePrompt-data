The provided program defines a function `func_1` that filters a dictionary based on integer values compared to a given threshold `n`. The output hints clarify that the function is designed to return entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

From the assertions provided, we see that:
1. When `n = 170`, the function correctly returns entries for 'Cierra Vega', 'Alden Cantrell', and 'Pierre Cox'.
2. When `n = 180`, it correctly returns entries for 'Alden Cantrell' and 'Pierre Cox'.
3. When `n = 190`, it returns only 'Pierre Cox'.

The output hints also state that the function will return an empty dictionary if no values meet the condition and can handle edge cases, such as when the input dictionary is empty. 

Since the logic in the program matches the problem description and considers all specified cases (including filters for various values of `n`), we can conclude that the function operates correctly.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**.
