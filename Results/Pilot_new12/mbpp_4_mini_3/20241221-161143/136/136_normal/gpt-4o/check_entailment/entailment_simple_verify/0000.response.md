Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It filters the input dictionary `d` to retain only those entries whose values are greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The logic employed in the dictionary comprehension is sound, and the assertions provided effectively validate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs.

Additionally, the annotations confirm that:

- The function receives valid inputs (a dictionary with integer values and an integer `n`).
- It correctly returns a filtered dictionary based on the defined criteria of including only key-value pairs with values greater than or equal to `n`.

As all tests pass successfully and the logic aligns with the requirements, the function maintains correctness, leading to the conclusion that the original assessment is justified.
