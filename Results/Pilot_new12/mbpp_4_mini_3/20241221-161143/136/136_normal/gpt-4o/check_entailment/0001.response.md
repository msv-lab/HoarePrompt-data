Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements defined in the problem description. It takes a dictionary and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary that includes only the entries with values that are greater than or equal to `n`. 

The following assertions confirm the functionality:

- When `n` is set to 170, the expected output is `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, and this matches the output of the function.
  
- When `n` is set to 180, the expected output is `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is also correct according to the function's output.

- When `n` is set to 190, the expected output is `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`, and this aligns with the function's result.

Additionally, if we consider an edge case where all values in the dictionary are less than `n`, for instance:

```python
assert func_1({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 200) == {}
```

The function would correctly return an empty dictionary since no values meet the condition.

Overall, there are no potential cases that show the function failing to meet the requirements, as it correctly filters entries based on the provided integer. Thus, the function is correct.
