The program `func_1` is designed to filter a dictionary based on a threshold value `n`, as described in the problem statement. The original assessment, which indicates that the function is correct, is supported by the analysis of the assertions provided and the functionality outlined in the output hints.

Key points to consider:

1. The function correctly takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`.
2. It uses dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary containing only those entries from `d` that have values greater than or equal to `n`.
3. The assertions provided validate that the function behaves as expected for various values of `n`, returning the correct filtered dictionaries.
4. The output hints explicitly state that the function will return an empty dictionary when no values meet the condition, which aligns with expectations and is also tested in the edge case provided.

Since both the problem description and the validations through assertions align with the functionality of `func_1`, and the original assessment correctly highlights these aspects, the conclusion that the function is correct remains valid.

Final: **True**
