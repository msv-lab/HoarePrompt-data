Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries where the value is greater than or equal to the integer `n`. 

- It uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the items in the input dictionary `d`, checking each value against `n`.
- The provided assertions test the function with various inputs and all assertions pass, verifying that the function behaves as expected for those cases.

No missing logic or edge cases prevent the function from meeting the requirements stated in the problem description. Hence, it is deemed correct.
