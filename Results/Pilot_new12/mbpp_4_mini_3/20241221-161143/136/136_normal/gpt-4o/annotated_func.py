#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary with values of type integer, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 'd' where the value 'v' is greater than or equal to the integer 'n'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. If no values meet this condition, an empty dictionary is returned. This function effectively filters the input dictionary based on the specified threshold `n`, including all edge cases such as when `d` is empty or when all values are below `n`.
