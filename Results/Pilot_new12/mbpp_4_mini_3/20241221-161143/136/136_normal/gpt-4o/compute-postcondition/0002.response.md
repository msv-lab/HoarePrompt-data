Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. If no values meet this condition, an empty dictionary is returned. This function effectively filters the input dictionary based on the specified threshold `n`, including all edge cases such as when `d` is empty or when all values are below `n`.**
