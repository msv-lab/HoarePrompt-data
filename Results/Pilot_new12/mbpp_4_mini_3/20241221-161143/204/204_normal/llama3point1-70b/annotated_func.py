#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing a month number, where 1 <= n <= 12.
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns True if 'n' is in the list of months_31_days [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12], indicating that 'n' corresponds to a month with 31 days; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer parameter `n`, which represents a month number (1 through 12). It checks if `n` corresponds to a month that has 31 days, specifically the months of January, March, May, July, August, October, or December. If `n` is one of these months, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle edge cases beyond confirming that `n` is within the valid range of month numbers, therefore input values outside the range of 1 to 12 will also return `False` without any error handling.
