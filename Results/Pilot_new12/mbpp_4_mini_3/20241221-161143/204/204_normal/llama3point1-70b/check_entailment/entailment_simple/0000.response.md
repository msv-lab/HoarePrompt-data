Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` which takes an integer `n` representing a month number (where 1 represents January and 12 represents December) and checks whether the month corresponding to that number has 31 days. The months with 31 days are correctly represented in the list `months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`.

The key points that demonstrate the correctness of the program are:

1. **Valid Input Range:** The problem description mentions that `n` is an integer representing a month number between 1 and 12. The implementation assumes valid input, which aligns with the stipulation provided.

2. **Checking with a List:** The program uses the `in` operator to check if `n` is present in the list `months_31_days`. This is a straightforward and efficient way to determine if the month has 31 days.

3. **Returning the Correct Value:** If `n` is found in `months_31_days`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`, correctly adhering to the requirement of the problem description.

Overall, since the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible valid inputs, it is deemed correct.
