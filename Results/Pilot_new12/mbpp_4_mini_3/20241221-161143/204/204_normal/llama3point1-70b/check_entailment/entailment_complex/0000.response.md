Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a given month number (1 through 12) corresponds to one of the months that have 31 days. 

Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. **Valid Input Range**: The function is designed to take an integer `n` which represents the month number, and it is stated that `n` will be within the range of 1 to 12, which is a valid assumption according to the description.

2. **List of Months with 31 Days**: The program correctly defines a list of month numbers that contain 31 days: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`. These correspond to January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. 

3. **Membership Check**: The use of `return n in months_31_days` effectively checks if `n` is one of the month numbers that has 31 days. If `n` is found in the list, it returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function does not explicitly handle inputs outside of the range of valid month numbers, but since the problem guarantees valid input (1 to 12), it functions correctly under these constraints. For any input within this range, it will always return the correct result based on whether the month has 31 days.

Thus, the function performs exactly as described in the problem, making its correctness valid.
