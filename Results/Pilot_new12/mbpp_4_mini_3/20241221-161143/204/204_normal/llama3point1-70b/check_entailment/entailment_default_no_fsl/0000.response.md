Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input month number `n` is outside the valid range of 1 to 12. While it does return `False` for such inputs, it fails to provide any indication or feedback about the invalid input. The problem description requires correctness for "every potential case," including inputs that are invalid (e.g., 0, 13, negative numbers), and since the function does not appropriately handle or inform about such cases, it cannot be considered correct.
