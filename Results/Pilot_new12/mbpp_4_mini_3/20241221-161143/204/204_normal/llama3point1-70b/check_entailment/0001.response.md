Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly checks whether a specified month (represented by its number, where January is 1 and December is 12) has 31 days. The months that contain 31 days are listed in the list `months_31_days` as follows: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

The function `func_1` simply checks if the input number `n` is in this list. The program handles the input correctly for valid month numbers (1 to 12) and will return `True` for all months with 31 days and `False` for all others, including February and the four months with 30 days (April, June, September, November).

No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail under any valid input scenario. Therefore, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and behaves as expected for all valid inputs.
