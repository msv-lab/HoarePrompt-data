Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` properly checks whether a given month number (where 1 represents January and 12 represents December) corresponds to one of the months that contain 31 days. The list `months_31_days` contains the correct month numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12), and the function uses a straightforward membership test (`n in months_31_days`) to return the correct boolean value.

The annotations confirm that before the function call, `n` is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 12, which means that the implementation will always receive valid inputs that correspond to actual months. Given that the function accurately identifies and returns the correct boolean value for each possible month and handles valid inputs accordingly, there are no identified edge cases that would affect correctness. 

Thus, the function fulfills the requirements of the problem description, and the provided annotations support the assessment, confirming the function's correctness.
