Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given month number, within the valid range of 1 to 12, corresponds to a month that contains 31 days. The provided annotated code clarifies that the function checks if `n` is in the predefined list `months_31_days`, which includes the correct month numbers (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) that have 31 days. The behavior of the function is clearly defined and adheres to the problem description, returning `True` for inputs corresponding to these months and `False` otherwise.

The annotations confirm that the input month number `n` is always treated as valid (1 through 12), implying that any valid inputs will yield the correct output without causing errors. Therefore, the program effectively meets the problem requirements, and I see no reason to alter the initial assessment.
