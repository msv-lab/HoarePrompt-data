Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number (where 1 <= n <= 12) contains 31 days by verifying if `n` is present in the list `months_31_days`, which includes the months that indeed have 31 days: January, March, May, July, August, October, and December.

The annotations confirm that the input value `n` is guaranteed to be a valid integer within the specified range, ensuring that all possible valid inputs are covered. The function effectively returns `True` for valid cases where the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise, handling all the specified conditions correctly.

Thus, both the reasoning in the original assessment and the annotated states support the conclusion that the program meets the problem requirements and operates correctly.
