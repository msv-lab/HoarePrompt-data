You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It checks if the input month number `n` is in the predefined list `months_31_days`, which contains the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). 

All valid month numbers (1 to 12) will either fall into this list (return True) if they correspond to months with 31 days or return False for any month not included in the list (April, June, September, November, and February). 

The implementation handles the following cases correctly:
- Month 1 (January) returns True.
- Month 2 (February) returns False.
- Month 4 (April) returns False.
- Month 7 (July) returns True.
- Month 12 (December) returns True.

Therefore, since it handles the problem description correctly for all valid inputs, the answer is True.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes an integer parameter `n`, which represents a month number (1 through 12). It checks if `n` corresponds to a month that has 31 days, specifically the months of January, March, May, July, August, October, or December. If `n` is one of these months, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle edge cases beyond confirming that `n` is within the valid range of month numbers, therefore input values outside the range of 1 to 12 will also return `False` without any error handling.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
