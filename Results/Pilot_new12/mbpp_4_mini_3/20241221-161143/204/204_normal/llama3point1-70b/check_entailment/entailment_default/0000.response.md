Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle input values that are outside the valid range of month numbers (1 through 12). According to the problem description, the function is supposed to check if a given month number contains 31 days. However, if the input month number is invalid (e.g., `0`, `13`, or any negative number), the function will still return `False` without any indication of an error or an invalid input. This discrepancy means the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description adequately. Since it fails to handle any potential case where `n` may be outside the expected range of month numbers, it is incorrect.
