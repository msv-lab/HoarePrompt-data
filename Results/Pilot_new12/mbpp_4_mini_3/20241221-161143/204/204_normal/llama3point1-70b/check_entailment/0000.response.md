Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. It checks if the input month number `n` is in the predefined list `months_31_days`, which contains the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). 

All valid month numbers (1 to 12) will either fall into this list (return True) if they correspond to months with 31 days or return False for any month not included in the list (April, June, September, November, and February). 

The implementation handles the following cases correctly:
- Month 1 (January) returns True.
- Month 2 (February) returns False.
- Month 4 (April) returns False.
- Month 7 (July) returns True.
- Month 12 (December) returns True.

Therefore, since it handles the problem description correctly for all valid inputs, the answer is True.
