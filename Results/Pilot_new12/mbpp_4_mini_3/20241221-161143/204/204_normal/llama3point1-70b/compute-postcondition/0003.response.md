Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer parameter `n`, which represents a month number (1 through 12). It checks if `n` corresponds to a month that has 31 days, specifically the months of January, March, May, July, August, October, or December. If `n` is one of these months, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle edge cases beyond confirming that `n` is within the valid range of month numbers, therefore input values outside the range of 1 to 12 will also return `False` without any error handling.**
