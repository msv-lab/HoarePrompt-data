The provided program is designed to check whether a given month number contains 31 days. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the months with 31 days by checking if the input month number belongs to the predefined set of months with 31 days. This includes January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

However, the output hints indicate that the function does not validate the input month to ensure it is within the range of valid month numbers (1 to 12). Consequently, if a user were to input an invalid month number, such as 0 or 13, the function could still return a result (True or False) depending on whether the invalid number is in the set, thereby producing incorrect behavior.

For instance:
- If `func_1(0)` is called, it would return `False` as 0 is not in the set of months with 31 days. This is incorrect behavior since 0 is not a valid month.
- Similarly, if `func_1(13)` is called, it would also return `False`.

Given that the function does not handle these potential cases properly, it does not adhere strictly to the problem description, which implies valid month numbers ranging from 1 to 12.

Correctness: **False**.
