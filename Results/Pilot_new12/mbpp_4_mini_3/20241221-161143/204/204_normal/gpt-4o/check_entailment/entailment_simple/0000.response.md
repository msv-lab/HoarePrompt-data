Correctness: **True**

The program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number corresponds to a month that contains 31 days. 

Here's how the function operates:
- It uses a set `months_with_31_days` which contains the month numbers that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, represented by the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12).
- The function then checks if the input `month` is present in this set using the `in` operator, returning `True` if it is (indicating that the month has 31 days), and `False` otherwise.

The assertions included in the annotated program further validate the function's correctness:
- `func_1(5)` returns `True` as May has 31 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` as February does not have 31 days.
- They cover all relevant months, confirming that the function behaves as expected for each case.

Since the function accurately checks months for having 31 days and handles all provided test cases correctly as per the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.
