Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to check whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. While the provided implementation checks for certain months, it does not handle all possible values for the month input. Specifically, if the month number is either 0 or greater than 12, the function will not return a proper boolean value and will consequently fail.

For instance:
- If `func_1(0)` is called, it will return `False` because `0` is not in the `months_with_31_days` set, but `0` is not a valid month number.
- If `func_1(13)` is called, it will similarly return `False`, but again, `13` is not a valid month number.

The program lacks checks for valid month input (1 through 12), meaning it fails on edge cases where the input is either invalid or outside the prescribed range.

Thus, since the code does not properly handle all potential cases (specifically invalid month entries), it is deemed incorrect.
