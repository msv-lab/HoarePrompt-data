Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description. While it correctly identifies the months that have 31 days, it does not handle the requirement that it should check if the given month number is valid (i.e., an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive). The problem description implies that the function should check if the input month is valid before determining if it has 31 days.

For example:
- If the input month is 0 or 13 (which are outside the valid range), the function could potentially return `False` even though the input is invalid. The problem description suggests that the check should include only valid month numbers (1 through 12).

Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem description because it does not ensure that the month provided is valid, which means it could erroneously return a result for invalid inputs that do not meet the expected criteria. This oversight leads to non-compliance with the specified requirements.
