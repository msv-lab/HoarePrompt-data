You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies whether a given month has 31 days. It uses a set containing the month numbers that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). The function checks if the supplied month is in this set. 

The assertions provided cover the following cases:
- Month 5 (May): Returns True, correctly indicating it has 31 days.
- Month 2 (February): Returns False, correctly indicating it does not have 31 days.
- Month 6 (June): Returns False, correctly indicating it does not have 31 days.
- Month 1 (January): Returns True, correctly indicating it has 31 days.
- Month 12 (December): Returns True, correctly indicating it has 31 days.
- Month 11 (November): Returns False, correctly indicating it does not have 31 days.

All potential months (1 to 12) have been accounted for, and the function works as intended. Thus, the program is correct for all verified cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive, representing the month number.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if 'month' is an integer between 1 and 12 that is in the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter 'month' that should represent a month number ranging from 1 to 12. It checks if this month belongs to the set of months that have 31 days (which includes January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). The function returns True if 'month' is one of these months; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle any validation to ensure that 'month' is within the specified range (1 to 12), which means it could potentially return True or False for invalid input values such as 0 or 13. Additionally, the function will return False for February and April, which have 28 and 30 days respectively.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
