You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to check whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. While the provided implementation checks for certain months, it does not handle all possible values for the month input. Specifically, if the month number is either 0 or greater than 12, the function will not return a proper boolean value and will consequently fail.

For instance:
- If `func_1(0)` is called, it will return `False` because `0` is not in the `months_with_31_days` set, but `0` is not a valid month number.
- If `func_1(13)` is called, it will similarly return `False`, but again, `13` is not a valid month number.

The program lacks checks for valid month input (1 through 12), meaning it fails on edge cases where the input is either invalid or outside the prescribed range.

Thus, since the code does not properly handle all potential cases (specifically invalid month entries), it is deemed incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer parameter 'month' that should represent a month number ranging from 1 to 12. It checks if this month belongs to the set of months that have 31 days (which includes January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). The function returns True if 'month' is one of these months; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle any validation to ensure that 'month' is within the specified range (1 to 12), which means it could potentially return True or False for invalid input values such as 0 or 13. Additionally, the function will return False for February and April, which have 28 and 30 days respectively.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
