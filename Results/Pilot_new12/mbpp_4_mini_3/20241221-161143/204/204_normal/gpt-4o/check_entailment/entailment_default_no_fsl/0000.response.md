Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle cases where the input month number is outside the valid range of 1 to 12. For instance, if the function is called with inputs such as 0 or 13, it will incorrectly return `False` since these numbers are not valid month numbers, yet thereâ€™s no indication in the problem description that the function should behave this way. This makes it incorrect as it does not satisfy the problem's requirement for all potential cases. 

Additionally, while the output hints mention that the function works for 31-day months and includes the correct months, it fails to handle invalid inputs appropriately. Thus, since it does not follow the problem description correctly for all cases, the output is deemed incorrect.
