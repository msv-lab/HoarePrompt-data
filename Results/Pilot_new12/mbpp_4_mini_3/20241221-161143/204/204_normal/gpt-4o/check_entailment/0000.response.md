Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies whether a given month has 31 days. It uses a set containing the month numbers that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). The function checks if the supplied month is in this set. 

The assertions provided cover the following cases:
- Month 5 (May): Returns True, correctly indicating it has 31 days.
- Month 2 (February): Returns False, correctly indicating it does not have 31 days.
- Month 6 (June): Returns False, correctly indicating it does not have 31 days.
- Month 1 (January): Returns True, correctly indicating it has 31 days.
- Month 12 (December): Returns True, correctly indicating it has 31 days.
- Month 11 (November): Returns False, correctly indicating it does not have 31 days.

All potential months (1 to 12) have been accounted for, and the function works as intended. Thus, the program is correct for all verified cases.
