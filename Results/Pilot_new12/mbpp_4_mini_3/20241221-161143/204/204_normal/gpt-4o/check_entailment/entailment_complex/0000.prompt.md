You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive, representing the month number.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if 'month' is an integer between 1 and 12 that is in the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter 'month' that should represent a month number ranging from 1 to 12. It checks if this month belongs to the set of months that have 31 days (which includes January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). The function returns True if 'month' is one of these months; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle any validation to ensure that 'month' is within the specified range (1 to 12), which means it could potentially return True or False for invalid input values such as 0 or 13. Additionally, the function will return False for February and April, which have 28 and 30 days respectively.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
