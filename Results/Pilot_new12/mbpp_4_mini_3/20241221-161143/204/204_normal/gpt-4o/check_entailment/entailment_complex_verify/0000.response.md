Final: **True**

The original assessment that the program's correctness is **True** is accurate. The program correctly identifies whether the given month number has 31 days based on the problem description. It employs a set to check if the month is one of those that have 31 days, which is sufficient and adheres to the requirements specified.

The annotations provided reinforce this conclusion by clearly stating the expected format of the input and confirming that the function will correctly return `True` or `False` based on the month number belonging to the appropriate set. The function's behavior aligns perfectly with the provided assertions, which cover all relevant month cases from 1 to 12 without any exception handling for inputs outside this range, as per the assumption that valid input is always provided. 

Therefore, the program meets the criteria of the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness stands confirmed.
