The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `month`. `month` is an integer that must be between 1 and 12 inclusive, representing the month number. If `month` is an integer that falls within the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `month` and return `True` if it is one of the months with 31 days, and `False` if it is not in that set. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter month, returns `True` if month is one of the months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). If month is not one of those, it returns `False`.**
