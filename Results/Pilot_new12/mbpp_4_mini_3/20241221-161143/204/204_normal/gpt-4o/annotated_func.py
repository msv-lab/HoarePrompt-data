#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive, representing the month number.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if 'month' is an integer between 1 and 12 that is in the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter 'month' that should represent a month number ranging from 1 to 12. It checks if this month belongs to the set of months that have 31 days (which includes January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). The function returns True if 'month' is one of these months; otherwise, it returns False. It does not handle any validation to ensure that 'month' is within the specified range (1 to 12), which means it could potentially return True or False for invalid input values such as 0 or 13. Additionally, the function will return False for February and April, which have 28 and 30 days respectively.
