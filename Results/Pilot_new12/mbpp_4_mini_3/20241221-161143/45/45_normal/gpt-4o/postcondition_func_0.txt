The function accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if its digits exhibit a specific alternating pattern. Specifically, it converts the integer to its string representation and performs the following checks: If the length of the string representation `s` is less than 3, it returns `False`. If the first and second digits of `n` (in string form) are the same, it also returns `False`. For strings of length greater than or equal to 3, it verifies that digits at even indices (starting from index 0) match the first digit and those at odd indices match the second digit. If all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`. If any condition fails, or if `n` does not satisfy the digit pattern, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, and it presumes `n` is always valid as per the initial premise.
