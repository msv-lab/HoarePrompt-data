You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains an error that results in an incorrect output for some potential test cases. The problem description implies that a number is considered undulating if it alternates between two digits, starting with different digits. 

Let's consider a test case: 

- Input: `12121`
  - According to the definition of undulating numbers, `12121` should return `False` because the second and third digits are the same (both are `1`), failing the undulating property.

However, according to the implementation in the function `func_1`, the program will return `True` for `12121` since it expects even and odd indexed digits only on the first indices of `first_digit` and `second_digit`. 

Hence, there exists at least one input where the program does not perform as expected according to the problem description, making the entire implementation incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if its digits exhibit a specific alternating pattern. Specifically, it converts the integer to its string representation and performs the following checks: If the length of the string representation `s` is less than 3, it returns `False`. If the first and second digits of `n` (in string form) are the same, it also returns `False`. For strings of length greater than or equal to 3, it verifies that digits at even indices (starting from index 0) match the first digit and those at odd indices match the second digit. If all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`. If any condition fails, or if `n` does not satisfy the digit pattern, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, and it presumes `n` is always valid as per the initial premise.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
