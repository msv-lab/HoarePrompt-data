Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains an error that results in an incorrect output for some potential test cases. The problem description implies that a number is considered undulating if it alternates between two digits, starting with different digits. 

Let's consider a test case: 

- Input: `12121`
  - According to the definition of undulating numbers, `12121` should return `False` because the second and third digits are the same (both are `1`), failing the undulating property.

However, according to the implementation in the function `func_1`, the program will return `True` for `12121` since it expects even and odd indexed digits only on the first indices of `first_digit` and `second_digit`. 

Hence, there exists at least one input where the program does not perform as expected according to the problem description, making the entire implementation incorrect.
