Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all possible cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails for numbers with longer repeating patterns that do not follow the strict alternating structure as specified. 

For example, consider the number `121212`:

- The expected behavior for this input would be that it should return `True` since the digits alternate correctly.
- However, if we consider a case like `1221` (where there are more than two of the same digit but the first two digits do not match). The program would incorrectly process this as valid `False`, which demonstrates that not all conditions are properly handled according to the problem statement.

Hence, there are instances where the code does not meet the criteria laid out in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the overall correctness of the program is **False**.
