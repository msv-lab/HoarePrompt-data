You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the condition specified in the code is met.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3.
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the condition is met where the first digit is equal to the second digit for the positive integer `n` with its string representation `s` of length greater than or equal to 3.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`; the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`; `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`; `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`.
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer; `s` is a string representation of `n`; `len(s)` is greater than or equal to 3; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`; `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`; `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`; all characters at even indices (2, 4, 6, ...) in `s` are equal to `first_digit` and all characters at odd indices (3, 5, 7, ...) in `s` are equal to `second_digit`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the conditions based on the first_digit and second_digit in the string representation of the positive integer n are satisfied, with all characters at even indices matching first_digit and odd indices matching second_digit.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if its digits exhibit a specific alternating pattern. Specifically, it converts the integer to its string representation and performs the following checks: If the length of the string representation `s` is less than 3, it returns `False`. If the first and second digits of `n` (in string form) are the same, it also returns `False`. For strings of length greater than or equal to 3, it verifies that digits at even indices (starting from index 0) match the first digit and those at odd indices match the second digit. If all these conditions are met, the function returns `True`. If any condition fails, or if `n` does not satisfy the digit pattern, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, and it presumes `n` is always valid as per the initial premise.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
