To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we first need to clarify what "undulating" means in the context of the program. An "undulating" number typically alternates between two digits. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the provided program:

1. It first checks if the length of the number (after converting to a string) is less than 3. If it is, it correctly returns `False`, as an undulating number requires a minimum length of 3.

2. It then compares the first two digits of the number. If they are the same, it returns `False`, as this would not be an undulating number.

3. For the remaining digits, the program employs a loop (starting from index 2) to ensure that:
   - Digits at even indices equal the first digit.
   - Digits at odd indices equal the second digit.

4. If all these conditions are satisfied, the program returns `True`, indicating the number is indeed undulating.

Now, based on the assertions given:
- `func_1(1212121)` returns `True`: This is correct, as it alternates between `1` and `2`.
- `func_1(1991)` returns `False`: This is also correct, as it does not alternate beyond the first two digits.
- `func_1(121)` returns `True`: This is correct as it does alternate between `1` and `2`.

Based on this logic, the program correctly implements the requirements for determining if a number is undulating according to the problem description. 

The program checks all the necessary conditions, handles cases with lengths less than 3 appropriately, and checks for the alternation of digits correctly. Therefore, it adheres to the specifications.

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
