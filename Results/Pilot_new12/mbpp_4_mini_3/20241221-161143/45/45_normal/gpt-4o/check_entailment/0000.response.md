To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to analyze whether the function correctly identifies undulating numbers.

An undulating number is defined by the following characteristics:
1. It should alternate between two distinct digits.
2. The first two digits should not be the same.
3. It must have a length of at least 3 characters (digits).

Now, let's break down the provided code and its logic.

### Analyzing the Code

```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True
```

#### Breakdown:
1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the length of the string representation of the number is less than 3. If it is, it returns `False`, which is correct as undulating numbers must have at least 3 digits.
2. **First Digit Equality Check**: It then checks if the first digit is the same as the second digit. If they are the same, it returns `False`, which is also correct.
3. **Alternating Digits Check**: The loop checks for the rest of the digits:
   - If the index is even, it should match the first digit.
   - If the index is odd, it should match the second digit.

#### Example Assertions:
- `func_1(1212121)` should return `True` (correct).
- `func_1(1991)` should return `False` (correct).
- `func_1(121)` should return `True` (in a typical case, but it looks like omitted a case).

### Edge Cases
Now, let's consider the edge cases that may break this logic.

1. **Case of repeating the same digit**:
    - Input: `111` (Should return `False` but the code will return `True`, as it satisfies the alternating requirement when checked on index).
  
2. **Length 2 Check**:
    - Input: `12` (Should return `False`, but will return `False` as expected).
  
3. **Larger mix-up checks**:
    - Input: `1213` (Should return `False`, and it does).
  
### Conclusion
While this code works for most examples and checks, there are indeed edge cases where it does not function as intended. 

For instance, the number `121` is returning `True` even though it shouldn't as per the undulating definition. `111` could mistakenly also be treated as `True` due to the logic, which clearly violates the rules as it has only one alternating digit prevalent.

Thus, as we identified that the logic fails in certain cases or is incomplete, we can deduce that:

Correctness: **False**.
