The variable `first_digit` is assigned the value of the first character in the string `s`, which is the string representation of the positive integer `n`. Since `s` has a length of at least 3, `first_digit` will be the first character of `s`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial characteristics as described. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`, and its length is greater than or equal to 3; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`.**
