Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; `s` is a string representation of `n`; `len(s)` is greater than or equal to 3; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`; `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`; `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`; `i` is currently 2 and is even; `s[i]` is equal to `first_digit`; the value of `i` is not odd; hence the condition `i % 2 == 1` is false and `s[i]` is not different from `second_digit`.***
