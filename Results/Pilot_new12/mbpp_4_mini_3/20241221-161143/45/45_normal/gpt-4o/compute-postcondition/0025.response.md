Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length greater than or equal to 4, with `first_digit` as the first character and `second_digit` as the character at index 1 of `s`, where `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i` is an odd integer and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False. If the condition is not met (i.e., `i` is even or `s[i]` equals `second_digit`), the function does not return any value.***
