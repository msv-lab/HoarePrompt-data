`n` is a positive integer, and `s` is assigned the value of `str(n)`, converting the positive integer `n` into its string representation. The value of `s` now reflects this transformation, while the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`.**
