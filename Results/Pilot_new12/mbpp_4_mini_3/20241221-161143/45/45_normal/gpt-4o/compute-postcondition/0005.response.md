The variable `second_digit` is assigned the value of the character at index 1 of the string `s`. Since `s` is the string representation of the positive integer `n`, and it's given that the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `s[1]` will have a defined value corresponding to the second digit of the integer represented by `n`. Thus, `second_digit` will store that character.

The states of other variables remain unchanged. The value of `first_digit` is still the first character of `s`, and `s` remains the same string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`; the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`; `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`.**
