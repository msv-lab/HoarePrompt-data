Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length greater than or equal to 4, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i` is odd and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, when `i` is 3, the else part does not apply.***
