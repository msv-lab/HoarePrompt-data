Postcondition: ***`n` is a string with at least 2 characters and `undulating` is True. If the character at index `i - 1` is less than the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` is less than the character at index `i + 1`, or the character at index `i - 1` is greater than the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
