The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. If the length of `n` is less than 3, the function returns `True`, indicating that it is considered undulating. If the length of `n` is 3 or more, the function checks for an undulating pattern and returns `True` if `n` is fully undulating; otherwise, it returns `False` if a violation occurred during comparisons. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and determine if it is fully undulating while considering the length of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns True if the length of n is less than 3 or if n is fully undulating; otherwise, it returns False if a violation occurs during comparisons.**
