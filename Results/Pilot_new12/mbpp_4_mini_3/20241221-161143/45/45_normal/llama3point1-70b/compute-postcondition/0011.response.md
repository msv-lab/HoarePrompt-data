The variable `undulating` is changed from `True` to `False`. The other variables remain unaffected; hence the value of `n` still remains a string with at least 2 characters, and `i` has been incremented by 1 but its specific value is not known. 

Output State: **`n` is a string with at least 2 characters, `undulating` is False, `i` is incremented by 1**
