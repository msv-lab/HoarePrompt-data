According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `n`. The loop iterates for `i` starting from 1 to `len(n) - 1`. For the loop to execute, `len(n)` must be greater than 1, which implies that `n` must have at least 2 characters. 

Since `undulating` does not affect the loop's execution, it can remain unchanged. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the next value after the last valid index in the range.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the states need to be adjusted to: `n` must be a string with a length of at least 2, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`n` must be a string with at least 2 characters, `undulating` is True, `i` is 1**
