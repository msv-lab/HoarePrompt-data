Postcondition: ***`n` is a string with at least 2 characters. If `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]`, then `undulating` remains True and `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
