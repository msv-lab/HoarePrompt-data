The `pass` statement is a no-operation statement in Python that does not change any variables or the program's state. Therefore, there are no impacts on the variables from the initial state, aside from any updates to `i`.

In the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1. Since we don't have the previous value of `i`, we can only state that it has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a string with at least 2 characters, `undulating` is True, `i` is increased by 1**.
