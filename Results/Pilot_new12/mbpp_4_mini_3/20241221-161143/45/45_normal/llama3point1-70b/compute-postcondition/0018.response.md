Postcondition: ***`n` is a string with at least 4 characters and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i-1` is less than the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` is less than the character at index `i+1`, or the character at index `i-1` is greater than the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i+1`, the program continues to the next iteration or logic. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
