Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies the shortcomings of the function `func_1`. It correctly assesses that the function does not properly account for undulating conditions when there are three or more digits, particularly failing in scenarios like `111` and `1221`. The output hints also support this assessment, indicating that consecutive digits can disrupt the undulating pattern, which the function fails to identify. Therefore, the conclusion remains valid: the function does not correctly determine whether a number is undulating under all possible cases, confirming its incorrectness.
