Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the digits of the number are the same. According to the problem description, a number's digits should alternate between increasing and decreasing to be considered undulating. 

For instance, if the input number `n` is `111`, the expected output should be `False` since all digits are the same and do not form a valid undulating sequence. However, the program would return `True` because `len(n)` is less than 3 and the program immediately returns `True` for cases with fewer than 3 digits, without checking for this specific violation of the undulating condition. 

Thus the program does not satisfy the requirements for every potential case.
