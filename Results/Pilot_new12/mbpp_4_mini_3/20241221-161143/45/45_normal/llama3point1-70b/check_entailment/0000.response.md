To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we first need to understand what an "undulating" number is. An undulating number alternates between ascending and descending values.

Analyzing the code:
```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

### Check the logic:
- The program converts the number to a string and loops through the characters.
- It checks whether the current digit is between its previous and next digits, either consistently increasing or decreasing.
- If any digit fails to be higher or lower than its neighbors, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
  
### Potential edge cases:
1. **Case of consecutive identical digits**: The program does not handle cases where there are consecutive identical digits, such as `121`, which is undulating. If the input was `1221`, it would incorrectly identify that as undulating because it checks only for strict inequality.
   
2. **Single digit and two-digit numbers**: Numbers like `0`, `7`, `12` are not handled explicitly. Since undulating requires at least three digits to check the alternation property, the program should ideally return `True` for single or two-digit numbers as they trivially do not violate undulating properties.
   
For example, if we input a two-digit number such as `11`, the program will not return `True` because it does not satisfy the checked condition, and thus would incorrectly conclude that it is not undulating, even though by definition such a number should be considered undulating.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle edge cases, particularly with repeated digits and single/two-digit inputs. Therefore, based on the aforementioned observations:

Correctness: **False**.
