Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find the smallest possible frame that satisfies the conditions. Specifically, the program calculates the bounding box of the white pixels but does not ensure that the resulting frame has the smallest possible size. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 8
..w.w.w.
........
........
..w.w.w.
```

The expected output should be:

```
..w.w.w.
.+w+++w.
++.w+++.
..w.w.w.
```

However, the current implementation might produce a larger frame because it does not check if the calculated bounding box can be shrunk further while still enclosing all white pixels. The program should check if the width and height of the bounding box can be reduced to form the smallest possible frame before finalizing the result.
