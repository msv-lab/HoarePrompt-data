Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the frame is the smallest possible one that satisfies the conditions. Hereâ€™s a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4 5
..w..
.....
..w..
..w..
```

The correct output should be:
```
..w++
.....
..+++
..w++
```

However, the current implementation might return:
```
..w..
.....
..w..
..w..
```

This happens because the code calculates the bounding box of all white pixels but does not check if there is a smaller valid frame. To fix this, the code needs to iterate over all possible frame sizes and positions to find the smallest valid one.
