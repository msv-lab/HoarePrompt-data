Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input dimensions `n` and `m` from the first line and the actual screen from subsequent lines.
   - It correctly handles the input constraints and formats.

2. **Finding the Extremes:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the screen to find the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost positions of the white pixels ('w').
   - This ensures that all white pixels are included within the bounds of the identified rectangle.

3. **Frame Validation:**
   - After identifying the bounding box, the program checks if the frame's height and width are at least 2 pixels.
   - If the dimensions are less than 2, the function returns -1, indicating that a valid frame cannot be formed.

4. **Creating the Frame:**
   - A copy of the original screen is made to avoid modifying the input directly.
   - The program updates the border cells of the identified rectangle to '+' if they were originally '.'.
   - This ensures that the resulting frame is correctly represented with '+' characters.

5. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints the modified screen or -1 based on the results from the function `func_1`.

Given these points, the program adheres to the problem description in all scenarios:
- It correctly identifies the smallest possible frame that includes all white pixels.
- It handles cases where no valid frame exists by returning -1.
- It correctly modifies and outputs the screen with the frame indicated by '+' characters.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
