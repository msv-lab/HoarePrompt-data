Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` is `i`, `right` is `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`, and `bottom` is `i` if `i > bottom`. If `i < top`, then these conditions hold true. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above regardless of the if condition.***
