The code calculates the `frame_height` as the difference between `bottom` and `top` plus 1. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`.**
