The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial values of `left` and `right` are both set to 1, and `j` is also 1. Therefore, `left` and `right` will both be updated to 1.

The other variables (`i`, `m`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 1, `right` is 1**
