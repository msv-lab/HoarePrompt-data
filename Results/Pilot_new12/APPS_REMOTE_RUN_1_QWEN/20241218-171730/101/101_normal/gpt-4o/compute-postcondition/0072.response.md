The code assigns the same value to both `left` and `right`, which is `j`. Before the assignment, `left` and `right` were equal to `right`, which was previously `j`. Therefore, after the assignment, `left` and `right` both become `j`.

The other variables (`screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, and `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `right` is unchanged, `left` is `j`**
