The code sets `top` and `bottom` both equal to `i`. Let's go through the impact:

1. The initial values of `top` and `bottom` were set such that `top` was equal to `i` and `right` and `bottom` were updated based on the conditions provided in the initial state.
2. After executing the line `top = bottom = i`, both `top` and `bottom` now have the value of `i`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `top` is now `i`
- `bottom` is now `i`

The other variables (`screen`, `i`, `j`, `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `top` is `i`, `right` is `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`, `bottom` is `i`**
