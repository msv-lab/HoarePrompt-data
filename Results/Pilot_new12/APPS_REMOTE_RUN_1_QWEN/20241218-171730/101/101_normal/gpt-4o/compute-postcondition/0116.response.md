Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is a value within the range `[0, m - 1]`, `m` must be greater than 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `top` is `None`, then `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, and `left` is `j`. Otherwise, `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is `n + 1` if `i > bottom`, `left` is updated to `j` if `j < left`, and `right` is updated to `j` if `j > right`.***
