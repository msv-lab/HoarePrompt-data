The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Initially, `j` is 0. Therefore, `left` and `right` will both be set to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0**
