The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is less than `left`, so after this assignment, `left` will become equal to `j`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are valid indices for `screen`, `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` remains unchanged and equals `i`, `bottom` equals `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, and the current value of `j` is less than `left`.**
