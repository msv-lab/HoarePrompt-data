The value of `right` is assigned the value of `j`. From the initial state, `j` is 1. Therefore, `right` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `top` is `n + 1`, `bottom` is `n + 1`, `left` is 1, `right` is 1**
