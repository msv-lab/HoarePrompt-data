The code `left = right = j` assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial values of `left` and `right` are `0`, so they will be updated to `j`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, and `screen` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w", `top` is `i + 1`, `bottom` is `i + 1`, `left` is `j`, and `right` is `j`.**
