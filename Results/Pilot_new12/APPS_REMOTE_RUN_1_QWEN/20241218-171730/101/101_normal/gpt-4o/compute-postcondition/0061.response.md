Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are valid indices for `screen`, and the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'; `top` remains unchanged and equals `i`; `bottom` equals `i`. This holds true regardless of whether `i > bottom` is true or false since there is no else part to consider other than the initial conditions specified.***
