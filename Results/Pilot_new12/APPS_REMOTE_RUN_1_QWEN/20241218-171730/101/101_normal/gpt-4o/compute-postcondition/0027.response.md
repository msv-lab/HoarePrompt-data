The code `bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `bottom`. According to the initial state, `i < top`, which means that the condition `i < top` remains true, and the values of `top`, `left`, and `right` do not change. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `top` remains unchanged.
- `bottom` is now `i`.
- `left` remains unchanged.
- `right` remains unchanged.

The output state is: **`top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is `i`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged**.
