The code sets `bottom` to the value of `i`. The value of `i` is greater than `bottom`, so after executing `bottom = i`, the value of `bottom` will be updated to the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is `i` if `i < top`, otherwise it is unchanged; `bottom` is now `i`; `left` and `right` are still `None`.**
