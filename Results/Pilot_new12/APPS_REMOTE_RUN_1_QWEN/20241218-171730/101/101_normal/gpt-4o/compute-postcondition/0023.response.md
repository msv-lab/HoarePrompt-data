The code sets both `top` and `bottom` to the current value of `i`. Since `top` and `bottom` were previously set to their respective conditions based on the value of `screen[i][j]`, they are now both equal to `i`.

- If `top` was `None` or `i > top`, then `top` is now `i`.
- `bottom` is explicitly set to `i`.
- The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j+1` if `j+1 > left`, otherwise it remains `None`, `right` is `j+1` if `j+1 > right`, otherwise it remains `None`.**
