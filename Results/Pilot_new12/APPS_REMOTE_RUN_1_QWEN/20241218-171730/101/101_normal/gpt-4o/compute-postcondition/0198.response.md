To solve this problem, we need to understand the condition under which the loop can continue executing. The loop iterates over a range defined by `left` and `right + 1`, and within each iteration, it modifies the `result[i][j]` element.

Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved**: The loop variable is `j`, and the range is from `left` to `right + 1`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the specified range (`left` to `right + 1`).
3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `result[i][j]` is either `.` or `+`.
4. **Update the State**: For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be within the range `left` to `right + 1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and still lies within the range `left` to `right + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
- Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was at some value `j_prev`.
- The loop will continue if `left <= j_prev + 1 <= right + 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
- `i` and `j` are updated within the loop, but we need to focus on the next value of `j`.
- If `j_prev` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, then `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j_prev + 1`.

### Final State:
- The value of `j` will be incremented by 1.
- `result[i][j]` could be either `.` or `+`, but since the condition for continuing the loop is based on `j` being within the range, the value itself does not change the ability to continue the loop.

Thus, the state to be adjusted for the next iteration is:

**State: **`result[i][j]` is either `.` or `+`, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, and `left <= j_prev + 1 <= right + 1`**.
