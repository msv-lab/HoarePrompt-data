Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w".
   - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are defined based on the positions of 'w' in `screen`.
   - `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.
   - `frame_height` and `frame_width` are both greater than or equal to 2.
   - `result` is a deep copy of `screen`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over all rows `i` from `top` to `bottom` inclusive.
   - For each row `i`, it iterates over all columns `j` from `left` to `right` inclusive.
   - If `i` is `top` or `bottom` and `j` is `left` or `right`, and if `result[i][j]` is `'.'`, it updates `result[i][j]` to `'+'`.

3. **After Loop Completion:**
   - After the loop completes, `screen` remains unchanged.
   - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain unchanged.
   - `result` has had its border cells updated to `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`.

4. **Final Values:**
   - `screen` and its related variables (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`) do not change during the loop.
   - `result` will have all border cells updated to `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`. No other cells in `result` will be changed from their original values in `screen`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is as described above.
