The code `result[i][j] = '+'` updates a specific element in the `result` list to '+'. The indices `i` and `j` are defined as the current row index being either `top` or `bottom`, and the current column index being either `left` or `right`. Given these conditions, we know that the specific elements in `result` that are updated are `result[top][left]`, `result[top][right]`, `result[bottom][left]`, and `result[bottom][right]`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Update `result[top][left]` to '+'.
2. Update `result[top][right]` to '+'.
3. Update `result[bottom][left]` to '+'.
4. Update `result[bottom][right]` to '+'.

All other values of `result` remain unchanged, and the other variables (`screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, and `result`) retain their original values except for the changes made to the specified indices in `result`.

Output State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with `result[top][left]`, `result[top][right]`, `result[bottom][left]`, and `result[bottom][right]` updated to '+'**.
