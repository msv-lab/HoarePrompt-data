Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2000\).
   - `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` consisting of characters "." (black pixel) and "w" (white pixel).
   - At least one pixel in the screen is white.
   - `top` is `None`.
   - `bottom` is `None`.
   - `left` is `None`.
   - `right` is `None`.
   - `i` is `0`.

2. **Understand the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the strings in the `screen` list, denoted by `j` in the range from `0` to `m-1`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, the loop variable `j` must start at `0` and go up to `m-1`. Since `i` is given as `0`, we don't need to adjust `i`.
   - The main concern is ensuring that the loop can proceed, which means that the list `screen` should contain at least one string, and each string should be of length `m`.

4. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - Since `j` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, the loop will execute if `screen` has at least one string and each string has a length of `m`.
   - The initial values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` being `None` are acceptable since they will be updated during the loop execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters "." and "w".
- `top` is `None`.
- `bottom` is `None`.
- `left` is `None`.
- `right` is `None`.

Given the above analysis, the final answer is:
State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w", `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`**.
