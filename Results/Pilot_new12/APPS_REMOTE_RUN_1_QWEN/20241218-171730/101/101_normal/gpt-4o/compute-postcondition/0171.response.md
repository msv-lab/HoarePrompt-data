Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w".
- `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`.
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`.
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.
- `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each row index from `top` to `bottom` inclusive.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `top`: Smallest row index of any 'w'.
   - `bottom`: Largest row index of any 'w'.
   - `result` is initialized as a list of `n` copies of the corresponding strings in `screen`.

3. **After the Previous Iteration**:
   - Suppose the loop just completed an iteration for `i = k` where `k` is some row index between `top` and `bottom`.
   - The next iteration will be for `i = k + 1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since we are moving to the next row (`i = k + 1`), `top` and `bottom` will remain the same unless there is a change in the positions of 'w' characters.
   - `left` and `right` will also remain the same because the loop does not modify these values.
   - `frame_height` and `frame_width` will remain the same as long as `top` and `bottom` do not change.
   - `result` will have processed the current row, updating the border cells as necessary.

5. **Updated State**:
   - `top` remains unchanged.
   - `bottom` remains unchanged.
   - `left` remains unchanged.
   - `right` remains unchanged.
   - `frame_height` remains unchanged.
   - `frame_width` remains unchanged.
   - `result` will have the updated border cells for the row `k` but needs to process the next row `k + 1`.

### Conclusion:

Since the loop only processes the rows from `top` to `bottom`, and `top` and `bottom` do not change within the loop, the only thing that changes is the value of `i`. 

Therefore, the updated state before the next iteration should reflect the new row index `i = k + 1` being processed.

**State:**
- `screen` remains the same.
- `top` remains the same.
- `bottom` remains the same.
- `left` remains the same.
- `right` remains the same.
- `frame_height` remains the same.
- `frame_width` remains the same.
- `result` reflects the updated border cells for the row `k`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`screen` is a list of `n` strings, each string is of length `m` and consists of characters ".", "w"; `top` is the smallest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `bottom` is the largest row index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `left` is the smallest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `right` is the largest column index of any 'w' in the entire `screen`; `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`; `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`; `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2; `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of `n` lists, each list is a copy of the corresponding string in `screen` with all border cells (rows `top` and `bottom`, columns `left` and `right`) updated to '+' if they were originally '.'; `i` is `k + 1`.**
