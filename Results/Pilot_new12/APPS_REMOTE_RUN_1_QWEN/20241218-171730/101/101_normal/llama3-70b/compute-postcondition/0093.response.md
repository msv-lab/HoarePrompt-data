According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pixels`. If there are more rows in the `pixels` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the string joined from `row` has been printed. This means that we have processed one row of the `pixels` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another row in the `pixels` list to process. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that there is at least one more row to process.

State: **The string joined from `row` has been printed, and `pixels` must have at least one more row.**
