The code `print(''.join(row))` does not assign any new values to any variables. Instead, it prints the concatenation of all elements in the list `row`. Since no new variables are defined or modified, the only thing that changes is the output, which is the joined string from `row`.

Output State: **The string joined from `row` is printed.**
