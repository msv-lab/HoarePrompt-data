Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` must be less than `m-1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(m)` will iterate over values of `j` from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis**: 
   - The condition `if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.'`: No changes are made to `white_pixels`.
   - Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, it is changed to `'w'`.
   - If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, no changes are made to `white_pixels`.

4. **Current State**:
   - Since `j` must be less than `m-1` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is currently `m-2` (assuming `m` is an integer).

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m-1`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be set to `m-1` at the start of the next iteration.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State**: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be less than `m-1` (which means `j` should be set to `m-1` for the next iteration)**.

So, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be less than `m-1` and set to `m-1` for the next iteration**.
