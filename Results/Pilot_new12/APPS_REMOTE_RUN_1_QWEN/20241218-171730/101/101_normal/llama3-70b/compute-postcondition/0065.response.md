To determine the final output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the loop and the conditions under which it operates:

### Initial Conditions:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- For all `(i, j)` in `white_pixels`, `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))`, and `'.'` otherwise.
- If `pixels[i][j]` was `'w'`, it remains `'w'`.
- If `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`, it becomes `'w'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `'.'` otherwise.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`. Within each iteration, it checks if the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` is met and the pixel at position `(i, j)` is `'.'`. If so, it sets `pixels[i][j]` to `'+'`. Otherwise, it checks if `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, and if not, it sets `pixels[i][j]` to `'.'`.

### Final State Analysis:
After the loop completes all its iterations, for each `j` from `0` to `m-1`, the pixel `pixels[i][j]` will be `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `'.'` otherwise. This is because the loop processes each column `j` independently and sets the pixel to `'+'` only if the specified condition is met.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop processes all columns `j` from `0` to `m-1`, and the condition to set `pixels[i][j]` to `'+'` depends only on the row index `i` and column index `j`, the final state of the `pixels` matrix will be such that:
- `pixels[i][j]` will be `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))`.
- `pixels[i][j]` will be `'.'` otherwise.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, for all `(i, j)` in `pixels`, `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))`, and `'.'` otherwise.**
