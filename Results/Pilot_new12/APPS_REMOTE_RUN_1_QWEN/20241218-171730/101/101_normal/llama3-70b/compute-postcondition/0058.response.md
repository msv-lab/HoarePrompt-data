Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[i][j]` is `+`, then the program continues without changing `j`. If `pixels[i][j]` is not `+`, `j` remains 1. If `pixels[i][j]` equals `'w'`, then `j` remains 1. Otherwise, `pixels[i][1]` is set to `'.'`.***
