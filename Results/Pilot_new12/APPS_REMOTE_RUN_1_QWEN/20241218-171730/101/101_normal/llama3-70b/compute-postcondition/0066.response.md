According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is the last value it was set to.

Given the conditions:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- For all `(i, j)` in `pixels`, `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))`, and `'.'` otherwise.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be increased by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Let's adjust the states:

1. `n` must still be greater than 1.
2. `white_pixels` must still contain at least one tuple.
3. `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
4. `i` must be less than `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` must be less than `n`**
