According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` must be greater than 0 (though this does not affect the loop's execution directly, we keep it as part of the context).
- `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple.

For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `0` to `m-1`.

So, the necessary adjustments are:

- Ensure `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- Keep `n` greater than 0 as given.
- Ensure `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
