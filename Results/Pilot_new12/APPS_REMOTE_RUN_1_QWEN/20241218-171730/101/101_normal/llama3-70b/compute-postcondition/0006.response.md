The code updates the values of `max_x` and `max_y`. Before the code runs, `max_x` is `float('-inf')` and `max_y` is `float('-inf')`. The code takes the maximum of `max_x` and `x` for `max_x`, and the maximum of `max_y` and `y` for `max_y`. Since `x` and `y` are the `x` and `y` values from a tuple in `white_pixels`, the new values of `max_x` and `max_y` will be the maximum value found among the `x` and `y` values of the tuples in `white_pixels`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of n lists, each containing m characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i, j) of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid and must contain at least one tuple, `min_x` is the minimum of `float('inf')` and the `x` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum of `float('inf')` and the `y` value from the tuple in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum `x` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum `y` value from the tuples in `white_pixels`**.
