Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` will be either `m-1` (updated from a previous value less than `m-1`) or will be explicitly set to `m-1`. If `(i, j)` meets the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'+'`. Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` remains unchanged.***
