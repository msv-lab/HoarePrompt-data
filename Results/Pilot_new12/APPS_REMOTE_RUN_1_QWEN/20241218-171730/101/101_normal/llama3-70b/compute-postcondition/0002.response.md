The code creates a list of tuples representing the coordinates of white pixels ('w') in the `pixels` grid. Specifically, it iterates over all rows `i` and columns `j` in the grid and checks if the pixel at position `(i, j)` is 'w'. If it is, it adds the tuple `(i, j)` to the list `white_pixels`. 

Given that `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), the `white_pixels` list will contain tuples representing the positions of all 'w' characters in the grid.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `pixels` is a list of n lists, each containing m characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i, j) of all 'w' characters in the `pixels` grid.**
