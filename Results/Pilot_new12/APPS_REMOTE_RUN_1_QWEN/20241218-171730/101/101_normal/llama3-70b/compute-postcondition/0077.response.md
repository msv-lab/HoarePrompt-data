Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `j` is 0
   - If `i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`, and the pixel value `pixels[i][j]` is equal to `'+'`, then the condition remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` equals `'w'`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, `pixels[i][0]` is set to `'.'`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and goes up to `m-1`, the next value of `j` will be 1.
   - All other states (`n`, `white_pixels`, `m`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body in this context.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that changes is `j`, which will be incremented to 1.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1**.
