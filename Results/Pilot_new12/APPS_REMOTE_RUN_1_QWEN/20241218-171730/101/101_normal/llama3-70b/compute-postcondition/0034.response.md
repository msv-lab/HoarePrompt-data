Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` must be less than `m-1`. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then no changes are made to `white_pixels`. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, it is changed to `'w'`. If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, no changes are made to `white_pixels`.***
