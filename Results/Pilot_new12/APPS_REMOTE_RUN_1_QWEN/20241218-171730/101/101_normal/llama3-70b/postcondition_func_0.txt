The function processes a grid of pixels represented as a list of strings, where each string contains exactly `m` characters ('.' for black pixels and 'w' for white pixels). It calculates the bounding box of the white pixels and checks if the size of this bounding box can fit within the original dimensions of the grid. If the bounding box cannot fit, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it modifies the grid by converting the border of the bounding box into '+' characters while keeping the white pixels as 'w' and all other pixels as '.'. Finally, it prints the modified grid row by row.
