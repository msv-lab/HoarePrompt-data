Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the smallest possible square frame that encloses all white pixels. Specifically, the code calculates the bounding box of the white pixels but does not ensure that the frame is the smallest possible square. This can lead to incorrect outputs in certain cases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 7
.......
.......
.w.....
.......
.......
```

The correct output should be:

```
.......
.......
+w.....
.......
.......
```

However, the provided code will produce:

```
.......
.......
+++++++.
.......
.......
```

This is because the code only checks if the bounding box can fit within the grid dimensions and then sets the boundary pixels to '+', without ensuring that the frame is the smallest possible square. The code needs to explicitly check for the smallest possible square that encloses all white pixels, which it currently does not do.
