Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is a non-empty string, `count` is updated based on the new first character of `s`, and `res` is the original content of `res` plus the new first character of `s` repeated `nc` times. If `count[nc] > 0`, `count[nc]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
