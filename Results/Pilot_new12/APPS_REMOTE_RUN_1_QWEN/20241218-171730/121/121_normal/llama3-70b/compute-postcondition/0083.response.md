Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255, `s` is the original string with its first character removed, `count` is a dictionary with counts of characters in the original string `s`, and `res` is a string containing the sequence of characters added according to the rules inside the loop until no more characters can be added (i.e., when `count[nc] <= 0` for all `nc` in `'ACGT'`).**
