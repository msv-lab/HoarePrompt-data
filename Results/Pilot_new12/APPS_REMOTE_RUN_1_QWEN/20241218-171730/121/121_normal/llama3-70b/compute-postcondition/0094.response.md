Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It processes the string `s` to replace all '?' characters with one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' such that the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the resulting string are as close to equal as possible. If the original string `s` contains characters other than '?', these characters are appended to the result as-is. After processing, the function prints '===' if any count of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' is greater than 0, otherwise it prints the resulting string `res`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
- If the input string `s` consists entirely of '?' characters, the function will still replace them with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to balance the counts as closely as possible. However, since the counts are already balanced, the function will print the resulting string without any further adjustments.
- If the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' cannot be exactly equal due to the presence of '?' characters, the function will distribute the '?' characters to minimize the imbalance. For example, if `n` is 4 and `s` is "????", the function will output "ACGT".
- The function ensures that the final string `res` will have balanced counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' by depleting the counts of the characters in the dictionary `count` until all values are zero or until no more '?' characters are left to replace.
- The function handles the case where the input string `s` might not contain any '?' characters, in which case the resulting string `res` will be identical to `s`.
