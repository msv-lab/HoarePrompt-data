Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` followed by a string `s` from the standard input. These inputs are processed as specified in the problem description.

2. **Count Calculation:**
   - A dictionary `count` is initialized to keep track of the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. The program iterates through the string `s` and increments the respective count for each non-'?' character. For '?' characters, they are not counted.

3. **Average Calculation:**
   - The average count (`avg`) for each type of nucleotide is calculated as `n // 4`. This ensures that the total number of nucleotides of each type should be approximately equal.

4. **Replacement Logic:**
   - Another for loop iterates through the string `s` again. For each '?' character, the program checks the available counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. If any of these counts are greater than 0, the '?' is replaced with the corresponding nucleotide, and the count is decremented. The loop breaks as soon as a valid replacement is made.
   - For characters that are not '?', they are directly appended to the result string `res`.

5. **Validation and Output:**
   - After processing, the program checks if any count in the dictionary `count` is greater than 0. If so, it prints "===" indicating that it is not possible to decode the genome such that all counts are equal. Otherwise, it prints the resulting string `res`.

### Validation Against Requirements:

- **Correct Input Parsing:** The program correctly handles the input as per the problem description.
- **Count Calculation:** The counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are accurately calculated and stored.
- **Nucleotide Replacement:** The program replaces '?' characters with one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' to ensure that the final count of each nucleotide is as equal as possible.
- **Output Validation:** The program correctly identifies and handles cases where it is not possible to balance the counts and prints "===" accordingly.

Given that the program adheres to all aspects of the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately, the program is correct.
