Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the genome by replacing each '?' with one of the four nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') such that the count of each type of nucleotide becomes equal. Here's why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Counting Existing Nucleotides**: The program first counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the given string `s` (excluding '?').
2. **Calculating the Average Count**: It calculates the average count of each type of nucleotide needed (`avg = n // 4`), which ensures that if the string is correctly decoded, each nucleotide will appear `avg` times.
3. **Replacing '?':** For each '?', it replaces it with the first available nucleotide from 'ACGT' that has a positive count in the `count` dictionary.
4. **Validation**: After attempting to decode the string, it checks if all nucleotide counts are equal. If not, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the decoded string.

Since the program follows the logic of balancing the nucleotide counts and ensuring that each '?' is replaced appropriately, it should work for any valid input as per the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where this program would fail based on the given logic and constraints.
