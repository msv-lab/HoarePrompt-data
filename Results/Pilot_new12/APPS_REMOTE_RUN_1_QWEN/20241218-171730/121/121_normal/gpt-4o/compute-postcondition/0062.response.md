Postcondition: **`counts` is a list with at least one element. If the count of `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count`, the count of `char` is incremented by 1, `result[i]` is set to `char`, and `target_count` remains unchanged. The function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
