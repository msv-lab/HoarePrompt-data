Postcondition: ***`i` is the last index where the loop updated `result[i]`. `counts` is a dictionary where each key's value is increased by 1 for each iteration where the key's count was less than `target_count`. `result` contains characters from `counts` where the count was less than `target_count`. If `result[i]` equals `'?'`, `i` is updated to the last index where the loop updated `result[i]`.***
