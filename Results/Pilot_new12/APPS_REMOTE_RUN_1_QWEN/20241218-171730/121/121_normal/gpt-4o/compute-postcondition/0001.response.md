The code splits the input string into a list of strings using the `split()` method. The original `input` string is expected to be in the format of two lines: the first line is an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) and the second line is a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. After the split operation, the resulting list will contain these two values.

Since the input is read as a single string and then split, the `data` variable will contain a list with two elements: the integer `n` as the first element and the string `s` as the second element. The original values of `n` and `s` are preserved in this list.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing [integer `n`, string `s`]**
