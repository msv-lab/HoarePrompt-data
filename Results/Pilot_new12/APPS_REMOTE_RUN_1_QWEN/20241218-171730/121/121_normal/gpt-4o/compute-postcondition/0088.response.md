The code `result[i] = char` assigns the value of `char` to the key `i` in the dictionary `result`. Since `i` is 4, the value of `result[4]` will be set to `char`. The initial values of `i` and `counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 4, `counts` is a non-empty dictionary with at least 4 keys, `result[4]` is `char`.**
