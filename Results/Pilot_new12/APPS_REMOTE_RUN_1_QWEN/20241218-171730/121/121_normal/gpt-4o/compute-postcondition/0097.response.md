Functionality: **The function processes a genome string \(s\) and determines if replacing '?' characters with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' results in each character having a count less than or equal to \(n/4\), where \(n\) is the length of the genome string. If any character count exceeds \(n/4\), the function prints '===' and returns. Otherwise, it replaces each '?' in the string with the character that has the smallest count and increments its count until all '?' are replaced. Finally, it prints the modified genome string.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(n \mod 4 \neq 0\), the function prints '===' and returns immediately.
- If no '?' characters are present in the genome string, the function simply prints the original string and returns.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where multiple '?' characters have the same smallest count. In such cases, the function will arbitrarily choose one character to replace '?' with, potentially leading to different outputs for the same input.
