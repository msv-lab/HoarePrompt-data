Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary. If the count of `char` in `counts` is greater than `target_count`, the postcondition does not specify any change to the dictionary. Otherwise, the postcondition does not specify any change to the dictionary either. Since both if and else parts do not specify any changes, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
