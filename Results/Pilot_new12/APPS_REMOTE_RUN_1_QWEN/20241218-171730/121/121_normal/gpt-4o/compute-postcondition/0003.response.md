The code assigns the value of `data[1]` to `s`. Initially, `data` is a list containing `[integer value of `data[0]`, string `s`]`. After executing `s = data[1]`, the value of `s` will be the same as the string in `data[1]`, while the value of `data[0]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing [integer value of `data[0]`, string `s`], `s` is the string from `data[1]`**
