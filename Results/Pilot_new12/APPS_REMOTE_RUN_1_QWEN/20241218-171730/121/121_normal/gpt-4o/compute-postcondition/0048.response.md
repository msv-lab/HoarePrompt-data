Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `result[1]` is either `char` (if the count of `char` in `counts` is less than `target_count + 1`), and `counts[char]` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.*** 

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else cases. Since there is no else part, the absence of an else does not change the postcondition, which already covers the behavior when the condition `counts[char] < target_count` is true.
