Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `counts` is a non-empty list, and `result` is either undefined or remains unchanged. If `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `result` remains undefined. If `counts[char]` is not less than `target_count`, then `result` also remains undefined since there is no assignment or modification to `result` in the else part.***
