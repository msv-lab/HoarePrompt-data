Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a flaw in how it handles the case where the number of question marks is more than the target count for any nucleotide type. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the number of nucleotides of each type becomes exactly equal after replacements. Here is a counterexample:

For the input:
```
8
GGGGGGGG
```

The program will output:
```
GGGGGGGG
```

However, the correct output should be something like:
```
AGACGTCT
```

or any other combination where each nucleotide type appears exactly twice. The current implementation does not guarantee this, as it only ensures that the number of each nucleotide is less than or equal to the target count but does not enforce equality. This can lead to invalid outputs where the counts are not perfectly balanced.
