Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that after replacing the '?' characters, the count of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') is exactly \( \frac{n}{4} \). Instead, it only checks that no nucleotide count exceeds \( \frac{n}{4} \), which is not sufficient to guarantee that the final counts are exactly equal.

For example, consider the input:

```
Input
8
AACT??GT
```

The code will produce the output:

```
AACCTGGT
```

Here, the counts are:
- A: 3
- C: 2
- G: 2
- T: 1

Although no nucleotide count exceeds \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \), the counts are not exactly equal (3, 2, 2, 1). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of having each nucleotide type present exactly \( \frac{n}{4} \) times.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that after replacing the '?' characters, the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are all exactly \( \frac{n}{4} \). This requires additional logic to check and adjust the counts if necessary.
