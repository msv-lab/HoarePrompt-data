Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the case where the sum of the counts of the nucleotides and question marks exceeds the necessary number for each type to be equal. As per the problem description, the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome should be equal. The program fails to check if the total number of nucleotides and question marks can be evenly distributed among the four types. For example, in the input "AAAAAAAT", the program incorrectly outputs "AAAAAAAT" instead of printing "===" because it does not validate whether the total count of 'A' and the remaining nucleotides can be evenly divided. This oversight leads to incorrect outputs in scenarios where the genome cannot be properly decoded.
