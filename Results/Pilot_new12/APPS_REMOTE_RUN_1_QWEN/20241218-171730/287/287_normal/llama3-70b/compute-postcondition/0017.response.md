`res` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged since there is no operation on `i`. The condition `i_prev + 1 < int(n)` still holds true because the code does not affect `i_prev` or `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `res` is `res - 1`, and `i_prev + 1 < int(n)` still holds true.

Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `res` is `res - 1`, and `i_prev + 1 < int(n)` still holds true.**
