The code initializes the variable `res` to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it. The only change is that `res` is now 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9; `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^9; `res` is 0**
