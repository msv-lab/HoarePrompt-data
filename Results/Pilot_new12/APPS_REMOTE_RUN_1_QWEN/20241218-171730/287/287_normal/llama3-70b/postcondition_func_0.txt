The function calculates and returns the total number of divisors of an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)), with each divisor counted as 2, and subtracts the count of perfect square divisors (counted as -1). The function reads an integer `n` from the user, iterates through all numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, checks if they are divisors of `n`, and updates the result accordingly. If a perfect square divisor is found, it adjusts the result by subtracting 1.
