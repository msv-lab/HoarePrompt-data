To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Conditions:
- `num` must be at least 16.
- `count` is either 4 or retains its original value (which is 2).
- `i` is 4.

### Loop Statement:
```
while i * i <= num:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i * i <= num`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 4.
   - For `i * i <= num` to be true when `i` is 4, `num` must be at least \(4^2 = 16\).

Since `num` must be at least 16, this condition is already satisfied based on the given information.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - To proceed to the next iteration, we need to increase `i` to the next value that satisfies the loop condition.
   - If `i` is incremented to 5, then `i * i` would be \(5^2 = 25\).
   - For the loop to continue, `num` must be at least 25 (since \(5^2 = 25\) and \(4^2 = 16\)).

Given that `num` must be at least 16 initially and now needs to be at least 25 for the loop to continue, we need to adjust `num` to ensure it meets this new requirement.

### Adjusted State:
- `num` must be at least 25.
- `count` can remain either 4 or retain its original value of 2.
- `i` will be incremented to 5 in the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num` must be at least 25, `count` is either 4 or retains its original value (which is 2), and `i` will be 5 in the next iteration**.
