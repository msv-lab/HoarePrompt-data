`count` is incremented by 1. The initial state tells us that `num` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), must be at least 4, `count` is 0, `i` is 2, and `num` is divisible by `i`. Since `num` is divisible by `i`, and `i` is 2, `num` is even. After incrementing `count`, its new value is 1.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 4; `count` is 1; `i` is 2; `num` is divisible by `i`**
