The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial state tells us that `count` is 1, so after executing this line, `count` will become 2. The values of `num`, `i`, and the condition that `num` is divisible by `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `count`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 4; `count` is 2; `i` is 2; `num` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is not equal to `num` divided by `i`**
