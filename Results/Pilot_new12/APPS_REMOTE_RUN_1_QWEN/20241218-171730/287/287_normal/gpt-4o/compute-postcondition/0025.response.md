Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` where \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and returns the count of its distinct divisors, including 1 and `num` itself. The function iterates from 1 to the square root of `num`, checking for divisors. If `i` is a divisor of `num`, both `i` and `num // i` (if they are not equal) are counted as distinct divisors. The function handles the edge case where `num` is a perfect square by ensuring that the square root is only counted once.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where `num` is a perfect square by ensuring that the square root is only counted once, which is accurate.
- The function correctly processes all integers within the specified range, \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), without any missing logic.
