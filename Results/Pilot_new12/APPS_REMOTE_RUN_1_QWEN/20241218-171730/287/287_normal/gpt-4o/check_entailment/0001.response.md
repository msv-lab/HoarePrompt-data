Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve a different problem than the one described. The program calculates the number of divisors of a number `n`, which is not equivalent to finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the range of weights. For any given `n`, the minimum weight is 1 (when the split is `[n]`), and the maximum weight is `n` (when the split is `[1, 1, ..., 1]` with `n` ones). Every integer between 1 and `n` inclusive can be a weight of some split of `n`. Therefore, the number of different weights is simply `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
print(n)
```

This program will correctly output the number of different weights for any given `n` based on the problem description.
