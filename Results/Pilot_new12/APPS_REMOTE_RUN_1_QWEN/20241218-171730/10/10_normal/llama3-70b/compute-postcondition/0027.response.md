The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was 0, so now `left` is 1. The values of `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 1, `bottom` is either 1 or 0.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 1, `bottom` is either 1 or 0**
