The code `bottom += 1` increments the value of `bottom` by 1. The initial value of `bottom` is either 1 or 0. After incrementing, the new value of `bottom` will be 2 if it was initially 1, and 1 if it was initially 0. The values of `left`, `right`, and `top` remain unchanged from their initial values.

Output State: **`left` is 1; `right` is 1; `top` is 2; `bottom` is 2 if initially `bottom` was 1, otherwise `bottom` is 1**
