The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `sofas`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `sofas` must have at least two tuples.
- `left` is 1 (it was 0 and has been incremented by 1).
- `right` is 0.
- `top` is 0.
- `bottom` is 0.

Output State: **`sofas` must have at least two tuples, `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 0.**
