Postcondition: ***`sofas` must have at least two tuples. If `sofa[0][1] < s[0][1]` and `sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]`, then `left` remains 0 and `right` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains 0, and `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain 0. Additionally, `top` is 1 more than its previous value if the if condition is not met.***
