According to the code, the loop will iterate over each tuple in the `sofas` list. For the loop to execute, the `sofas` list must contain at least one tuple. The loop will start iterating from the first tuple in the list.

The initial states provided are:
- `sofa` is a tuple containing the coordinates of a single sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2).
- `sofas` is a list of tuples, each representing the coordinates of a sofa in the format (x1, y1, x2, y2).
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 0.
- `top` is 0.
- `bottom` is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the `sofas` list contains at least one tuple. 

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: The states provided indicate that `sofa` is a tuple, but this is not relevant to the loop itself since the loop iterates over `sofas`, not `sofa`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `sofas` is not empty.
3. **Modification Needed**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `sofas` is a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `sofas` must have at least one tuple.

State: **`sofas` must have at least one tuple, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0**
