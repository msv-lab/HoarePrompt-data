#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is a tuple containing the coordinates of a single sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2), where x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers representing the row and column indices of the two cells covered by the sofa. sofas is a list of tuples, each representing the coordinates of a sofa in the format (x1, y1, x2, y2) as described above.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sofas` must be a non-empty list, `left` is the number of sofas to the left of the `sofa` in the same row, `right` is the number of sofas to the right of the `sofa` in the same row, `top` is the number of sofas above the `sofa` in the same column, `bottom` is the number of sofas below the `sofa` in the same column.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns left, right, top, and bottom, where left is the number of sofas to the left of the sofa in the same row, right is the number of sofas to the right of the sofa in the same row, top is the number of sofas above the sofa in the same column, and bottom is the number of sofas below the sofa in the same column.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a `sofa` (a tuple of integers representing the coordinates of a single sofa) and a `sofas` (a list of tuples representing the coordinates of multiple sofas) as inputs. It counts the number of sofas that are to the left, right, above, and below the given `sofa` within the same row or column, respectively. The function iterates through the `sofas` list, excluding the given `sofa`, and updates counters based on the relative positions of other sofas. After processing all other sofas, it returns four values: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`, which represent the count of sofas in those respective directions. The function handles the case where `sofas` is a non-empty list, but it does not handle the case where `sofas` is an empty list, in which case it would result in undefined behavior since no other sofas would be counted.
