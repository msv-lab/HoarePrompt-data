Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem but has a logical flaw in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the logic for counting `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` sofas is incorrect. The program only considers the first coordinate pair of each sofa (`sofa[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]`) when determining the position relative to other sofas. However, this logic fails to handle cases where the sofa spans across different rows or columns correctly.

Consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  2
  3 2
  1 2 1 1
  2 1 2 2
  1 0 0 1
  ```

- Explanation:
  - There are 2 sofas in the storehouse.
  - The first sofa covers cells (1, 2) and (1, 1).
  - The second sofa covers cells (2, 1) and (2, 2).
  - According to the problem description, the first sofa should have 1 sofa to its left (`cnt_l = 1`), and no sofas to its right, top, or bottom (`cnt_r = 0`, `cnt_t = 0`, `cnt_b = 0`).

However, the program incorrectly counts the `left` and `right` sofas because it only compares based on the first coordinate (`sofa[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1]`). For the first sofa, since `sofa[0][0]` is 1, it will not count the second sofa as being to the left or right, even though the second sofa is indeed to the right of the first sofa.

This issue makes the program incorrect as it fails to accurately count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
