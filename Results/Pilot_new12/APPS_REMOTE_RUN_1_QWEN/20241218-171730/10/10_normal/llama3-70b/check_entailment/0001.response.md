Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of sofas (`d`), dimensions of the storehouse (`n`, `m`), coordinates of each sofa, and the count values (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the given sofa. It checks if the sofas share a common side with the current sofa and updates the respective counters accordingly.

3. **Main Loop**: The main loop iterates over each sofa and uses `func_1` to get the counts of sofas relative to the current sofa. If the counts match the given `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`, it prints the index of the current sofa (adjusted by adding 1 since indices start from 0) and breaks the loop.

4. **Handling No Matching Sofa**: If no sofa matches the given conditions, the program prints `-1`.

Given the provided examples and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or examples found where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
