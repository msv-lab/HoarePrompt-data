`bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The conditions for updating `left_count[i]` remain unchanged, so `left_count[i]` does not change. The values of `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are not affected.

Output State: **`i` equals `j + 1`, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`, `left_count[i]` is as before the if statement, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1.**
