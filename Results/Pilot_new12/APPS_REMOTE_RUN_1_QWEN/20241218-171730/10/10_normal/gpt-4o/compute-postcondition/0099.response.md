The code `left_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. Since `i` is initially 0, this means `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The initial values of the variables are as follows:

- `i` is 0
- `j` is `k + 2`
- `right_count[0]` is either 2 or 3
- `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[k + 2]`
- `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[k + 2]`
- `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[k + 2]`
- `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[k + 2]`

After executing the code, `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 2, it will now be 3, and if it was initially 3, it will now be 4.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is `k + 2`; `right_count[0]` is either 2 or 3; `left_count[0]` is either 3 or 4; `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[k + 2]`; `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[k + 2]`; `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[k + 2]`; `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[k + 2]`.**
