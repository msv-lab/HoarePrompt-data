Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`, `top_count[0]` is incremented by 1, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`; otherwise, `right_count[0]` remains unchanged, and `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if the condition `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j` is not met, `bottom_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`; otherwise, `bottom_count[0]` remains unchanged. This state is reached if `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j` is true, otherwise, the counts remain as per the initial if part condition without additional changes.***
