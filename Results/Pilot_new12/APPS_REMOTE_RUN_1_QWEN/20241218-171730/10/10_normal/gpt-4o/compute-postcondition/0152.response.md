To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the initial conditions required for the loop to run. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `d-1`, so `i` must be in this range. Given that `i` is initially set to `d - 1`, the loop will only execute if `d` is at least 1.

Let's break down the required adjustments:

1. **Variable `d`**: Since `i` is `d - 1`, the loop will execute if `d` is at least 1. Therefore, `d` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `d - 1`, which means the loop will start with `i = d - 1` and decrement `i` in each iteration until it reaches 0. Thus, `i` should be adjusted to `d - 1`.

The other variables (`j`, `right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, `top_count`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count`, and `target_sofa`) do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given information. They are either initialized or will be updated within the loop body.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `d` being greater than or equal to 1 and `i` being `d - 1`.

State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `d` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `d - 1`, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `right_count[i]` is the count of positions where `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, `left_count[i]` is the count of positions where `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, `bottom_count[i]` is the count of positions where `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, `top_count[i]` is the count of positions where `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, `cnt_l` is the number of left boundaries, `cnt_r` is the number of right boundaries, `cnt_t` is the number of top boundaries, `cnt_b` is the number of bottom boundaries, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are all lists of `d` zeros, `target_sofa` is -1.**
