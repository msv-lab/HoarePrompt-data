Postcondition: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is `d`, `j` ranges from 0 to `d-1`, `left_count[i]` is 0, `right_count[i]` is 0, `top_count[i]` is 0, `bottom_count[i]` is 0, `cnt_l` is the number of left boundaries, `cnt_r` is the number of right boundaries, `cnt_t` is the number of top boundaries, `cnt_b` is the number of bottom boundaries, and if the condition `left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b)` is true, then we break out of the loop involving `i` and `j`; otherwise, no changes are made to these variables.**
