Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` equals `j`. `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. If `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
