`bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The conditions for updating `left_count[i]` are not met because the code snippet does not contain the conditional logic to update `left_count[i]`. Therefore, the value of `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` equals `j`; `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[j]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[j]`; `left_count[i]` remains unchanged; `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1.**
