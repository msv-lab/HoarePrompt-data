`top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 0, `top_count[0]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`; `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`. The value of `bottom_count[0]` remains unchanged; `top_count[0]` is incremented by 1.**
