The code snippet assigns the values from the tuple `sofas[j]` to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so the tuple `sofas[1]` is unpacked into these variables. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

- `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`.
- `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`.
- `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`.
- `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`.**
