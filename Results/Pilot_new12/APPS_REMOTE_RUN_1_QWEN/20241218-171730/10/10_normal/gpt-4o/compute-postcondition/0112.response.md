The code assigns the values from the tuple `sofas[j]` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Since the initial state specifies that `i` and `j` are integers and are equal to each other (`i == j`), and no changes are made to their values in the else part (if present), the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The tuples `sofas[j]` should contain exactly four elements, which are assigned to the respective variables.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `i` equals `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are the values from the tuple `sofas[j]`**
