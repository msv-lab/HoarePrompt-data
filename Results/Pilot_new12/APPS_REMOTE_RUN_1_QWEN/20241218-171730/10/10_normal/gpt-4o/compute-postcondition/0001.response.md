`n` and `m` are assigned the values of the integers obtained from the input, which are separated by a space. The values of `d`, `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `x_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x_1 ≤ n, `y_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ y_1 ≤ m, `x_2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x_2 ≤ n, `y_2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ y_2 ≤ m, `cnt_l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ cnt_l ≤ d - 1, `cnt_r` is an integer such that 0 ≤ cnt_r ≤ d - 1, `cnt_t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ cnt_t ≤ d - 1, `cnt_b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ cnt_b ≤ d - 1; `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input.**
