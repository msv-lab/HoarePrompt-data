The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop present in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the state of the program. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`.**
