`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the values obtained from `input().strip().split()`, which splits the input string into four parts and converts each part to an integer. The value of `d` remains unchanged since no operation was performed on it. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` must be at least 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer.

Output State: **`d` must be at least 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer**
