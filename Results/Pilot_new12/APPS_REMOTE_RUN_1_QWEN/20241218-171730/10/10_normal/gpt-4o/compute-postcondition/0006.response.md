According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. For the loop to execute again, `d` must be greater than 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `d` must be at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be at least 2.

The states that need to be adjusted are as follows:

- `d` must be at least 2.
- The other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `sofas`) remain the same since they are not affected by the loop.

State: **`d` must be at least 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer; `sofas` is now a list containing the tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
