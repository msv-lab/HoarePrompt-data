According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be at least 1.

To determine the states to adjust, we need to consider the following:
- The loop runs `d` times.
- After each iteration, `d` is decreased by 1.
- At the end of the last iteration, `d` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `d` must be at least 1.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The list `sofas` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

State: **`d` is at least 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer; `sofas` is a list containing the tuples `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` and possibly more, depending on previous operations.**
