The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. It also mentions that `d` must be at least 2 and `sofas` is a list containing the tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. However, since no operation directly modifies `d` or `sofas`, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer; `sofas` is now a list containing the tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
