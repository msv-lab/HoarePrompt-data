Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input values correctly, including the number of sofas (`d`), the dimensions of the storehouse (`n` and `m`), the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of other sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).
   - These values are parsed into the appropriate data structures (e.g., `sofas` list of tuples).

2. **Count Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the counts of other sofas relative to each sofa (`i`) using nested loops. Specifically:
     - `right_count[i]` increments if another sofa is to the right of `i`.
     - `left_count[i]` increments if another sofa is to the left of `i`.
     - `bottom_count[i]` increments if another sofa is below `i`.
     - `top_count[i]` increments if another sofa is above `i`.

3. **Validation:**
   - After calculating the counts, the program iterates through the `sofas` list to find the sofa that matches the given counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).
   - If a match is found, the corresponding sofa index (adjusted to be 1-based) is stored in `target_sofa` and the loop is terminated using `break`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the `target_sofa` value, which is either the index of the matching sofa or `-1` if no such sofa exists.

The program follows the exact steps outlined in the problem description without any logical errors or assumptions that would deviate from the intended behavior. It handles all necessary input checks and ensures that the output is consistent with the specified conditions.

Since the program accurately performs all required operations as per the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
