Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values (`d`, `n`, `m`, coordinates of sofas, and boundary counts) and stores them appropriately.
   
2. **Boundary Count Calculation:**
   - The program uses nested loops to calculate the number of sofas that satisfy the left, right, top, and bottom boundary conditions for each sofa. This is done accurately by comparing the coordinates of each pair of sofas.
   
3. **Condition Checking:**
   - After calculating the boundary counts for each sofa, the program checks if any sofa matches the exact boundary counts specified in the input (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).
   - If a matching sofa is found, the program sets `target_sofa` to the index of that sofa plus one and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no sofa matches the conditions, the program prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `d` is zero by initializing `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` as empty lists, ensuring that no sofa is matched and `-1` is printed.
   - The program assumes valid input and does not explicitly handle invalid inputs like non-integer values or non-adjacent coordinates, as per the problem statement instructions.

Since the program follows the problem description step-by-step and handles all required scenarios, it is correct.
