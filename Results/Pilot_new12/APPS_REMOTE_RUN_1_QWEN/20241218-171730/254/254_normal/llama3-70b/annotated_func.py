#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and the third input parameter (which is not present in the provided function definition but mentioned in the problem description) are integers such that 1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, which is `a` since `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` (with constraints 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500). It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function iteratively reduces the problem of finding the GCD by replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0. At this point, `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function then returns this GCD. Potential edge cases include when either `a` or `b` is 0; in such cases, the function correctly returns the non-zero value as the GCD.
