The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b` where `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Given the initial conditions:

- `a` is an integer
- `b` is not zero
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500 (this condition does not affect the variables `a` and `b`)

After executing the code:

- `a` will take the value of `b` before the operation.
- `b` will take the value of `a % b`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is not zero, `b` is a = b % a, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500**.
