Output State: **`a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500**. 

Explanation:
The loop continues to run as long as `b` is non-zero. In each iteration, `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. This process is known as the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers. Once `b` becomes zero, the loop terminates, and `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
