According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is the original value of `a % b`, and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 1500\).

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero. The values of `a` and `k` do not affect the condition for the loop to continue since they are not used in the loop condition.

Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `b` to ensure it is non-zero.

State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is the original value of `a % b`, and `b` must be non-zero**
