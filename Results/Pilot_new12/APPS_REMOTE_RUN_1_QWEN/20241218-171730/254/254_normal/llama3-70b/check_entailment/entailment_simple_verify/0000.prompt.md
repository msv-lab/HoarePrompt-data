You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) using the greatest common divisor (GCD) and checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the given intervals. However, the approach used in the `lcm` calculation is incorrect. Specifically, the formula used does not correctly compute the LCM for multiple numbers. The provided solution incorrectly assumes that the product of the numbers divided by their pairwise GCDs gives the LCM, which is not valid.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input `(4, 2, 3)`:

- The correct LCM of 4, 2, and 3 is 12.
- However, the program calculates the LCM as follows:
  - `func_1(4, 2) = 2`
  - `func_1(2, 3) = 1`
  - `func_1(4, 3) = 1`
  - Therefore, the calculated LCM is `4 * 2 * 3 // (2 * 1 * 1) = 12 // 2 = 6`, which is incorrect.

This incorrect LCM calculation leads to an incorrect determination of whether Mishka can light up the tree with the given intervals. For instance, with the input `(4, 2, 3)`, the program outputs 'YES', but the correct output should be 'NO'.

A correct approach would involve using the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD and then iteratively computing the LCM of the three numbers.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and the third input parameter (which is not present in the provided function definition but mentioned in the problem description) are integers such that 1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, which is `a` since `b` is 0


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
