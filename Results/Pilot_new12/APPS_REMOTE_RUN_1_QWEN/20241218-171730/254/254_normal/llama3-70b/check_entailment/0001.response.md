Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit at every second after switching them on. 

The logic in the program uses the least common multiple (LCM) to check if there exists a moment when all three garlands are lit simultaneously. However, the LCM calculation used here is flawed. Specifically, the `lcm` variable is calculated using a simplified formula that does not account for the actual LCM logic correctly. The function `func_1` is a correct implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD), but it is incorrectly applied to calculate the LCM.

For instance, consider the input `4 2 3`. According to the problem statement, it should output `NO`, because no matter what initial times are chosen, there will always be some second when none of the garlands are lit. However, the program incorrectly outputs `YES` due to the flawed LCM calculation.

A correct approach would involve checking if the time intervals are such that their combination guarantees coverage of all seconds. This can be achieved by verifying if the set of periods generated by the intervals covers all seconds starting from the maximum initial time chosen.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the LCM of all three intervals
lcm_value = lcm(lcm(k1, k2), k3)

# Check if it's possible to find x1, x2, x3 such that each second is covered
for x1 in range(max(k1, k2, k3)):
    for x2 in range(max(k1, k2, k3)):
        for x3 in range(max(k1, k2, k3)):
            if all((x - x1) % k1 == 0 or (x - x2) % k2 == 0 or (x - x3) % k3 == 0 for x in range(max(x1, x2, x3), max(x1, x2, x3) + lcm_value + 1)):
                print('YES')
                exit()

print('NO')
```

This corrected version checks all possible combinations of initial times and ensures that every second after the maximum initial time is covered by at least one garland.
