Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that at least one garland is lit every second after the switching time. Specifically, Mishka needs to find three moments \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(x_3\) such that after those moments, each second has at least one garland lit.

2. **Current Logic**: The current logic in the program attempts to use the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the intervals \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) to check if it's possible to satisfy the condition. However, the LCM approach is not directly applicable here because it doesn't guarantee that each second after switching the garlands on will have at least one garland lit.

3. **Misunderstanding of LCM**: The LCM of \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\) does not directly translate to a solution for the problem. For instance, if \(k_1 = 2\), \(k_2 = 3\), and \(k_3 = 4\), the LCM is 12, but simply switching the garlands at times that align with their LCM might not ensure that every second after switching is covered.

4. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve checking if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of any pair of intervals is 1. If \(\text{gcd}(k_1, k_2) = 1\), \(\text{gcd}(k_2, k_3) = 1\), and \(\text{gcd}(k_1, k_3) = 1\), then it is possible to switch the garlands in such a way that every second is covered. This is because if the GCD of any two intervals is 1, they are coprime, and their combination can cover all seconds.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - **Case 1**: \(k_1 = 2\), \(k_2 = 2\), \(k_3 = 3\)
     - GCD of (2, 2) is 2, GCD of (2, 3) is 1, GCD of (2, 3) is 1
     - Since \(\text{gcd}(2, 2) = 2\) (not 1), this case should output 'NO'.
   - **Case 2**: \(k_1 = 2\), \(k_2 = 3\), \(k_3 = 4\)
     - GCD of (2, 3) is 1, GCD of (3, 4) is 1, GCD of (2, 4) is 2
     - Since \(\text{gcd}(2, 4) = 2\) (not 1), this case should output 'NO'.

However, the current program incorrectly checks the LCM instead of the GCD, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
