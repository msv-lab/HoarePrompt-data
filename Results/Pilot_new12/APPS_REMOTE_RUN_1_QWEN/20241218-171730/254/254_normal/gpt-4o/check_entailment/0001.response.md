Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided solution correctly determines whether Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. The approach is to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the time intervals of the garlands. If the GCD of all three intervals is 1, it means that the garlands' states will eventually overlap to cover all seconds. Otherwise, if the GCD is greater than 1, it means there will be gaps where no garland is lit. This solution handles all potential cases as per the problem description, ensuring that the output is correct for any valid input.
