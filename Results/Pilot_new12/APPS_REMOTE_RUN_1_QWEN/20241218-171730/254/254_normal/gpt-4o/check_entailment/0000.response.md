Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. 

Here's a brief reasoning:
- The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three given time intervals \(k_1\), \(k_2\), and \(k_3\).
- If the GCD of these three values is 1, it means that the periods of the garlands' lighting cycles are relatively prime, and thus, it is possible to ensure that at least one garland is lit at any given time starting from some moment.
- Otherwise, if the GCD is greater than 1, it indicates that there will be intervals where none of the garlands are lit.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, it handles all cases correctly as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
