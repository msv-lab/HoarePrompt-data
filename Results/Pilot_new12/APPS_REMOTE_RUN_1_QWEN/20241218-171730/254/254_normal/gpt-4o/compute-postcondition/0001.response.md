The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `k1` and `k2` using the `math.gcd` function and assigns it to the variable `gcd_k1_k2`. The values of `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged, but `gcd_k1_k2` is now set to the GCD of `k1` and `k2`. The precondition that `1 ≤ k_i ≤ 1500` for `i` in `{1, 2, 3}` is still valid.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`**
