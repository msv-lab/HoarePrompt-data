Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly handles all the described scenarios:

1. If \( x > y + z \), it prints `+`.
2. If \( x < y \), it prints `-`.
3. If \( x == y \):
   - If \( z == 0 \), it prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `?` because the outcome depends on the votes of the unknown voters.

The annotations match the behavior described in the problem statement and the original code. The program does not make any assumptions beyond what is specified and correctly outputs `+`, `-`, `0`, or `?` based on the given conditions. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
