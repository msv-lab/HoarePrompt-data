Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code fails to correctly determine the result when \(x = y\) and \(z > 0\). According to the problem description, if \(x = y\) and \(z > 0\), the result is uncertain and should print '?'. However, the current implementation only prints '?' when \(x\) is not greater than \(y + z\) and not less than \(y\), which is insufficient. For example:

- When \(x = 5\), \(y = 5\), and \(z = 1\), the code incorrectly prints '+' because it does not account for the possibility that the single unknown vote could tip the balance to a draw ('0').

To fix this, the condition checking for uncertainty when \(x = y\) and \(z > 0\) needs to be properly implemented. Hereâ€™s an updated version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y and z > 0:
        print('?')
    else:
        print('0')
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
