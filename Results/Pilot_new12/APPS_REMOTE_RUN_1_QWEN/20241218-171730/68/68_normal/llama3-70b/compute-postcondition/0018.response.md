The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some internal logic since no parameters are provided. However, given the constraints, it implies that the function might internally use values within the range of 0 to 100 for x, y, and z. 

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on internal logic using non-negative integers x, y, and z within the range of 0 to 100.**
