Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers from input(). If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the condition holds as it is. If `x` is less than `y`, the condition remains unchanged. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, the output is '0'. Otherwise, the output is '?' and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as per the precondition.***
