The code snippet prints a `+`. This action does not affect any of the variables' values. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is `x`, `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the current value of `max_downvotes` is less than the current value of `min_upvotes`; a `+` is printed.**
