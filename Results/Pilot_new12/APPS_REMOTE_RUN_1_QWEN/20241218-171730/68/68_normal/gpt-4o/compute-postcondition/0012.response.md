Postcondition: **`min_upvotes` is `x`, `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and the maximum upvotes are not less than the minimum downvotes. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, then a `+` is printed. Otherwise, no additional action is performed.**
