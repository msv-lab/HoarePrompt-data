The function `coverage` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`, representing the coordinates of a cell in the pond, the dimensions of the pond, and the side length of the scoop-net, respectively. It returns the number of cells that can be covered by the scoop-net centered at the cell `(x, y)` within the pond dimensions `(n, m)`.

Given the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), the function calculates the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond. Specifically, it computes the number of cells in the pond that fall within the scoop-net's boundaries, which are defined by the radius `r` from the center cell `(x, y)`.

The function returns the value \((\min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - \max(x - r + 2, 0)) \times (\min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - \max(y - r + 2, 0))\). This expression ensures that the calculation respects the boundaries of the pond and correctly accounts for the cells covered by the scoop-net.

Potential edge cases include when the center cell `(x, y)` is close to the edges of the pond, where the minimum values might reach the edge of the pond, leading to a non-positive width or height for the coverage area. In such cases, the function will correctly compute the number of cells within the valid boundaries.
