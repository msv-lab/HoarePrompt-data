Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly implement the `coverage` function as required by the problem description. The output hints suggest that the current implementation of `coverage` does not properly calculate the number of cells intersecting with the scoop-net, especially near the edges of the pond. The formula used in the current `coverage` function does not correctly handle these edge cases, leading to incorrect coverage values. Therefore, the program cannot produce the correct expected number of caught fishes, as demonstrated by the examples and the problem statement requirements.
