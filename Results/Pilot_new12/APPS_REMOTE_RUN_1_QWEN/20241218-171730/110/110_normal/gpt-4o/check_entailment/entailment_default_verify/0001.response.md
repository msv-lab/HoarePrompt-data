Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided problem description and the output hints, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program's implementation of the `coverage` function and the logic in `func_1` do not correctly address the requirements of the problem. 

1. **Incorrect Coverage Calculation**: The `coverage` function does not properly handle edge cases where the scoop-net is near the boundaries of the pond. This leads to incorrect coverage calculations, as highlighted in the original assessment.

2. **Heuristic Approach**: The program uses a heuristic approach to select the cells for placing the fishes, which does not guarantee the maximum expected number of caught fishes. It uses a min-heap to maximize the sum of coverages but does not consider the distribution of these coverages, which is crucial for maximizing the expected value.

3. **Example Validation**: For the given example `3 3 2 3`, the program should place the fishes in cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) to achieve an expected value of 2.0000000000. However, the current implementation fails to achieve this optimal placement, indicating a flaw in the logic.

Given these issues, the original assessment of **False** is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum expected number of caught fishes due to the flawed coverage calculation and heuristic approach. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
