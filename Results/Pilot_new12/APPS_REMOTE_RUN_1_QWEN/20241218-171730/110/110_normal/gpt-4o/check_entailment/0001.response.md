Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum expected number of caught fishes. Specifically, the `coverage` function and the logic used in `func_1` do not accurately determine the optimal placement of the fishes.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Coverage Calculation**: The `coverage` function calculates the number of cells covered by the scoop-net but does not correctly handle the edge cases where the scoop-net is near the boundaries of the pond. This leads to an overestimation or underestimation of the actual coverage area.

2. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a min-heap to keep track of the highest coverage values, but this approach does not ensure that the chosen cells maximize the expected value of caught fishes. It simply tries to maximize the sum of coverages without considering the distribution of these coverages.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3 2 3
```
- **Expected Output**: The optimal solution would be to place the fishes in cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) because placing them here maximizes the expected number of caught fishes. In this configuration, for any of the four possible positions of the scoop-net, the number of fishes inside is always 2.
- **Program Output**: The program will likely not achieve the expected output of 2.0000000000 due to the incorrect calculation of coverage and the heuristic approach used.

To fix the program, a more sophisticated approach is needed to ensure that the placement of fishes maximizes the expected value of caught fishes. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming or a more precise greedy algorithm to handle the constraints and optimize the expected value calculation.
