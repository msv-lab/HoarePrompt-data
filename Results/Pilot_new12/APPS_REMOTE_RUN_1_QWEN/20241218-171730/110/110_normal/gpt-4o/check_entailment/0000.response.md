Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a greedy approach by calculating the coverage of each cell and selecting the top-k cells with the highest coverage. However, the logic in `coverage(x, y)` is incorrect. Specifically, the formula for calculating the coverage should account for the number of cells intersecting with the scoop-net, but the current implementation does not correctly calculate this.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- Input: `n = 3`, `m = 3`, `r = 2`, `k = 3`
- Expected solution: Place the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3) to achieve an expected value of 2.0.

However, the current program does not handle this case correctly. For instance, if we place the fishes in cells (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), the coverage calculation will be incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlap and the number of cells intersecting with the scoop-net.

A corrected version of the `coverage` function should be:
```python
def coverage(x, y):
    left_bound = max(x - r + 1, 0)
    right_bound = min(x + r, n)
    top_bound = max(y - r + 1, 0)
    bottom_bound = min(y + r, m)
    return (right_bound - left_bound) * (bottom_bound - top_bound)
```

With this correction, the program would correctly calculate the expected number of caught fishes for any given input.
