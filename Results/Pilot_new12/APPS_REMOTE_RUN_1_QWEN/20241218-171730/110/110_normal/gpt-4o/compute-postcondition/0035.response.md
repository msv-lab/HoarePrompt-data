The code snippet `total_coverage -= cov` subtracts the value of `cov` from `total_coverage`. The value of `cov` is the first element of the tuple popped from `heap`, which means it was previously part of the `heap` list. The other variables (`m`, `n`, `heap`, `x`, `y`, and `k`) remain unchanged because the code only modifies `total_coverage`.

Output State: **`m` is at least 0; `n` is at least 0; `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all remaining `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n` excluding the one with the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` excluding the tuple `(cov, x, y)`; `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`; `k` is `k - 1` and must be greater than 0; `cov` is the first element of the tuple popped from `heap`; `x` is the second element of the tuple popped from `heap`; `y` is the third element of the tuple popped from `heap`**
