The code `total_coverage -= cov` subtracts the value of `cov` from `total_coverage`. Given that `cov` is the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` in the original heap, and `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`, the value of `total_coverage` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 0; `n` is at least 0; `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for all remaining `0 ≤ y < m` and `0 ≤ x < n` excluding the one with the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` excluding the tuple `(cov, x, y)`; `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - cov`; `k` is `k - 1`; `cov` is the smallest `-coverage(x, y)` in the original heap; `x` is the first index of the smallest tuple; `y` is the second index of the smallest tuple**
