Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` is exactly `n`.
   - `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each iteration where `0 ≤ y < n`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the For Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `x` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - This means that at the start of each iteration, `x` takes on values from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `x` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by `1` from its value in the previous iteration.
   - The variable `m` remains unchanged as it was already equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration and the loop itself does not modify `m`.
   - The `heap` list remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop does not modify the `heap`.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `x` will be incremented by `1` from its value in the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, if `x` was `n-1` in the previous iteration, it will be `0` in the next iteration.
   - If `x` was `n-2` in the previous iteration, it will be `1` in the next iteration.
   - And so on.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`m` is exactly `n`, `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each iteration where `0 ≤ y < n`, `x` is `x + 1` from its value in the previous iteration.**

To provide a specific example, if `x` was `n-1` in the previous iteration:

State: **`m` is exactly `n`, `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each iteration where `0 ≤ y < n`, `x` is `0`**.

If `x` was `n-2` in the previous iteration:

State: **`m` is exactly `n`, `heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for each iteration where `0 ≤ y < n`, `x` is `1`**.

And so forth.
