Postcondition: ***`i` is 57, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and the 58th bit and 59th bit of `n` must both be 1, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), and `bits` is a list containing the values 60, 58, and 57. If the 58th bit of `n` shifted right by `i` (57) and bitwise ANDed with 1 is 1, the condition is met and no changes are made to the variables. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the precondition unless explicitly modified within the if part.***
