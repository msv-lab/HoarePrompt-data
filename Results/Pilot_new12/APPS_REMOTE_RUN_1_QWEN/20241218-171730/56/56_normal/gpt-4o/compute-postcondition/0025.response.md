The code snippet appends the value `smallest - 1` to the `bits` list. Since `smallest` is the value of the last element in the original `bits` list, appending `smallest - 1` to `bits` means that the new value of `bits` will include this additional element.

Let's denote the original `bits` list as `original_bits`. After the operation, the new `bits` list will be `original_bits + [smallest - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `bits` is the list of positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n` excluding the last position, plus the value `smallest - 1` appended to it; `smallest` is the value of the last element in the original `bits`; `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k > \text{len}(bits)\)**
