Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than the number of bits set in `n`. According to the problem description, if `k` is greater than the number of bits set in `n`, the output should be "No". However, the provided implementation always tries to form a sequence of length `k` by manipulating the bits of `n`, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
23 6
```
The binary representation of 23 is `10111`. It has 4 bits set. Since `k = 6` is greater than 4, the correct output should be "No". However, the program will attempt to form a sequence of length 6, which is incorrect.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the `func_1` function to ensure that `k` is not greater than the number of bits set in `n`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n.bit_count():
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))
```

With this correction, the program should handle all cases correctly according to the problem description.
