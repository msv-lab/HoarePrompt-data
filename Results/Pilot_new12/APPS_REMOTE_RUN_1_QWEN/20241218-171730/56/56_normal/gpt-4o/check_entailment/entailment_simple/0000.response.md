Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of `k` when `k > n`:**
   - The problem description states that if `k` is greater than `n`, the output should be "No". However, the provided code correctly handles this case and returns "No" when `k > n`. This part is correct.

2. **Bit Manipulation and Construction of the Result:**
   - The code correctly identifies the positions of the 1-bits in the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that the sum of `2^a_i` for the constructed sequence equals `n`.
   - However, the logic for ensuring the smallest possible largest integer in the sequence is not fully implemented. Specifically, the loop that appends `smallest - 1` twice to the `bits` list does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will be lexicographically largest.

3. **Ensuring Lexicographically Largest Sequence:**
   - The provided code simply appends `smallest - 1` twice to the `bits` list. This approach does not necessarily produce the lexicographically largest sequence. For example, consider the case where `n = 23` and `k = 5`. The binary representation of `23` is `10111`. The correct sequence should be `[3, 3, 2, 1, 0]`, which is already the lexicographically largest sequence. However, the provided code would append `2` twice, leading to a sequence like `[3, 2, 2, 1, 0]`, which is not the lexicographically largest sequence.

4. **Ensuring Minimum Largest Integer:**
   - The provided code does not ensure that the sequence has the minimum possible largest integer. It simply appends `smallest - 1` twice, which does not guarantee that the sequence is optimal.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly implement the solution, you need to ensure that the sequence is both lexicographically largest and has the minimum possible largest integer. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function that meets these criteria:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    
    result = []
    for i in range(k - len(bits)):
        result.append(bits[-1] - 1)
    
    result.extend(bits)
    result.sort(reverse=True)
    
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, result))
```

This implementation ensures that:
- The sequence is lexicographically largest by sorting the bits in descending order.
- The sequence has the minimum possible largest integer by appending `smallest - 1` as needed.

By making these adjustments, the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.
