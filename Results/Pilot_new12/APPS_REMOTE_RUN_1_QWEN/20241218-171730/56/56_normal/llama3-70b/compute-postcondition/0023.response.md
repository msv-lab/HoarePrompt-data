The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code, the only effect is that we exit the hypothetical context where such a structure would exist. However, since no variables are modified, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is the bit length of `n` minus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
