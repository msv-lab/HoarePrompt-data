Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list containing the sequence of integers where each integer is the highest power of 2 subtracted from `n` until `n` becomes 0; `i` is the number of iterations performed, which is the length of the list `a`; `k` is an integer obtained from input() and remains unchanged; `x` is the last value of `x` calculated during the final iteration, which is `bit_length(n) - 1` when `n` was just above 0.**
