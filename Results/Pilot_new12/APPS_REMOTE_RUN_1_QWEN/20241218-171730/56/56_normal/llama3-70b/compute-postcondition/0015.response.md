The code `x = n.bit_length() - 1` calculates the bit length of `n` and subtracts 1 from it. Since `n` is greater than 0, its bit length is a positive integer. Let's denote the bit length of `n` as `b`. Therefore, `x = b - 1`.

The output state is: `n` is greater than 0; `x` is equal to the bit length of `n` minus 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `x` is equal to the bit length of `n` minus 1**
