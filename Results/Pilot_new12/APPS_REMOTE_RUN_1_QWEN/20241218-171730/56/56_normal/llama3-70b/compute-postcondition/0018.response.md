`a.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `a`. Given that `x` is equal to the bit length of `n` minus 1, `x` is appended to `a`. The initial conditions of `n` being greater than 0 and `x` being equal to the bit length of `n` minus 1 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `x` is equal to the bit length of `n` minus 1; `a` is a list containing `[x]`**
