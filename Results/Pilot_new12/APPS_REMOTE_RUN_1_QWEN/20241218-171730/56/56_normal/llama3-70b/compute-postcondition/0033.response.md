`a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The value of `n` remains 0, the value of `k` remains unchanged (as it was obtained from input() and is not reassigned), the length of the list `a` does not change, and `x` is set to `i - 1`, where `i` is the original length of `a`. After sorting, the first element of `a` becomes the largest, and the last element becomes the smallest.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is [sorted list in descending order], `i` is the length of the original list `a`, `k` is an integer obtained from input() and remains unchanged, `x` is `i - 1`**
