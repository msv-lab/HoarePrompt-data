Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `a` is either a list containing the sequence of integers where each integer is the highest power of 2 subtracted from `n` until `n` becomes 0, with the length of `a` being less than `k`, or a sorted list in descending order. `i` is the length of the original list `a`, `k` is an integer obtained from input() and remains unchanged, `x` is either the last value of `x` calculated during the final iteration (which is `bit_length(n) - 1` when `n` was just above 0) or `i - 1`, and the function prints 'Yes' if the length of `a` is not less than `k`.***
