You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically largest sequence when there are multiple valid sequences with the minimum maximum value \(y\). 

Consider the input `13 2`. The correct output should be `"No"` since it is impossible to represent 13 as the sum of exactly 2 powers of 2. However, the program incorrectly outputs a sequence `(3, 2)` which sums to 13, violating the requirement that no valid sequence exists. 

Additionally, the program does not ensure that among sequences with the minimum \(y\) value, the lexicographically largest one is chosen. For instance, for the input `23 5`, the correct output should be `(3, 3, 2, 1, 0)`, but the program might produce another sequence that is not lexicographically largest if it does not properly handle ties for the minimum \(y\) value.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('No')
    else :
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            
            if x <= i:
                break
            
            a.append(x)
            
            n -= 2 ** x
            
            i += 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `a` is a list containing the sequence of integers where each integer is the highest power of 2 subtracted from `n` until `n` becomes 0; `i` is the number of iterations performed, which is the length of the list `a`; `k` is an integer obtained from input() and remains unchanged; `x` is the last value of `x` calculated during the final iteration, which is `bit_length(n) - 1` when `n` was just above 0.
        if (len(a) < k) :
            print('No')
        else :
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is 0, `a` is either a list containing the sequence of integers where each integer is the highest power of 2 subtracted from `n` until `n` becomes 0, with the length of `a` being less than `k`, or a sorted list in descending order. `i` is the length of the original list `a`, `k` is an integer obtained from input() and remains unchanged, `x` is either the last value of `x` calculated during the final iteration (which is `bit_length(n) - 1` when `n` was just above 0) or `i - 1`, and the function prints 'Yes' if the length of `a` is not less than `k`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer obtained from input(), `k` is an integer obtained from input(), and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. If `n` is less than `k`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, `n` is represented as a list `a` of integers where each integer is the highest power of 2 subtracted from `n` until `n` becomes 0, with the length of `a` being less than `k`. The list `a` is sorted in descending order, `i` is the length of the original list `a`, `k` remains unchanged, and 'Yes' is printed if the length of `a` is not less than `k`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
