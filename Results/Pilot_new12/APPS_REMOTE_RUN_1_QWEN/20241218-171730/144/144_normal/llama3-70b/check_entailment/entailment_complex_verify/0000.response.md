Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version and the problem description, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible value of mex. The annotated version highlights that the program increments `mex` only when it matches the current number in the sorted array and breaks the loop if the current number in the array is greater than `mex`. This logic is flawed because it does not account for gaps in the sequence of numbers in the array. For example, in the input:

```
3
1 2 3
```

The correct output should be `4`, but the program will output `3` because it breaks the loop when it encounters `3`. The program fails to handle cases where there is a continuous sequence in the array, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
