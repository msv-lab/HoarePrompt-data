Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible value of mex. The original assessment is accurate because the program only increments `mex` when it matches the current number in the sorted array and breaks the loop if it encounters a number greater than `mex`. This approach fails to handle cases where there is a continuous sequence in the array, leading to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 2 3
```

The correct output should be `4`, but the program will output `3` because it breaks the loop when it encounters `3`. The program should continue incrementing `mex` until it finds a gap in the sequence of numbers in the array. The annotated version confirms that the program's logic does not correctly handle this scenario. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
