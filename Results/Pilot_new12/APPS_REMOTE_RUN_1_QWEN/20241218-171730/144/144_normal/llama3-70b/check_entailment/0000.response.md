Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible value of mex. The provided solution only increments `mex` when it matches the current number in the sorted array. However, it should continue incrementing `mex` until it finds a gap in the sequence of numbers in the array. For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 3
```

The correct output should be `4`, but the program will output `3` because it breaks the loop when it encounters `3`. The program fails to handle cases where there is a continuous sequence in the array, leading to an incorrect result.
