`mex` is incremented by 1. The value of `mex` was the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`. After incrementing `mex` by 1, the new value of `mex` is the next smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `mex` is incremented by 1, and `arr` must have at least one element.**
