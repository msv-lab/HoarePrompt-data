The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `n` and the individual elements of `arr` will be rearranged based on their sorted order, but the initial value of `n` remains the same. The output state is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order**
