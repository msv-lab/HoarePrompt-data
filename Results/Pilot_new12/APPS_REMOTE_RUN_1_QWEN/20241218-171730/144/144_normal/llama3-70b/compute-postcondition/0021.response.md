Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `mex` is incremented by 1 if `num` equals `mex`. If `num` does not equal `mex`, `mex` remains unchanged. Furthermore, if `num` is greater than `mex`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***
