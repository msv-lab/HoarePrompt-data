The function reads an integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) integers from the standard input. It then sorts the array of integers in ascending order. After sorting, the function iterates through the array to find the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array. If all integers from 1 to \( n \) are present in the array, the function returns \( n+1 \). The function prints the result to the standard output.
