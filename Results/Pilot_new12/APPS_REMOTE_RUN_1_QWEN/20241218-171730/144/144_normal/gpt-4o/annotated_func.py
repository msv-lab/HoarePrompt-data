#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    mex = 1
    for num in a:
        if num >= mex:
            mex += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `a` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `mex` is the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.
    print(mex)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from standard input. It then sorts the list and calculates the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list. The function prints this integer. The function handles the case where the input list might contain duplicates and negative numbers, although these are ignored since only positive integers are considered in the calculation of the smallest missing positive integer. If the input list is empty or contains only zeroes, the function correctly identifies `1` as the smallest missing positive integer.
