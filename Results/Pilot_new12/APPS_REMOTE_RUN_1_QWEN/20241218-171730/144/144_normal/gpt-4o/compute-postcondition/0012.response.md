The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The value of `num` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not modify it. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `num` is the next value from the list `a`
- `mex` is either the current `mex` or `mex + 1` depending on the comparison, but now `mex` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`num` is the next value from the list `a`; `mex` is the previous value of `mex` + 1**
