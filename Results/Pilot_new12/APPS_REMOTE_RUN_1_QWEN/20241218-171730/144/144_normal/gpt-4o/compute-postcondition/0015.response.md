The code `print(mex)` simply prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. The variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `a` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `mex` is printed.**
