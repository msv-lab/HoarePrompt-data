Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `a` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `mex` is the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.** 

### Explanation:
- **Initial Values**: 
  - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000.
  - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
  - `mex` starts at 1.

- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.
  - For each `num`, if `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, `mex` is incremented by 1.
  - This process continues until `mex` is larger than the largest element in `a`.

- **Final State**:
  - After the loop completes, `mex` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.
  - Since `a` is sorted, we can be certain that `mex` will be the first missing positive integer in the sequence.
  - `n` and `a` retain their initial values because they are not modified within the loop.

### Summary:
- `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
- `mex` is determined to be the smallest missing positive integer from the list `a`.
