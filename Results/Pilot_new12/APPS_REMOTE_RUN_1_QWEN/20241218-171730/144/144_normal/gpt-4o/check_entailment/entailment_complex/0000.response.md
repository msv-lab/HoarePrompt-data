Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a` from the input. This matches the problem description, which states that the first line contains `n` and the second line contains `n` integers.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted using `a.sort()`. Although sorting is not strictly necessary to solve the problem, it simplifies the logic for finding the smallest missing positive integer.

3. **Finding the Mex**: The program initializes `mex` to 1 and iterates through the sorted array. For each element `num` in the array:
   - If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1. This ensures that `mex` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the array.
   - If `num` is less than `mex`, it means `mex` is still the smallest missing positive integer, so no action is taken.

4. **Output**: The program prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest positive integer not present in the array after the operations.

Given the problem constraints and the problem description, this approach is valid and will work for all cases where the input is a list of positive integers. The program correctly handles the logic of finding the smallest missing positive integer without any additional assumptions or incorrect behavior. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
