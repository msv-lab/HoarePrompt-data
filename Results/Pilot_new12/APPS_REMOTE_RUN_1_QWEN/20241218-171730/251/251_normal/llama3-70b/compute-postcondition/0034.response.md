According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from `i-1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[2]` is the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`, `i` is 2, `j` starts at 0 and can go up to 1, and the conditions involving `cakes[i][1]` and `cakes[j][1]` as well as `cakes[i][2]` and `cakes[j][2]` hold true.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to decrease by 1. Since `j` started at 0 and can go up to 1, it means `j` was previously 1. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `j` must now be 0.

State: **`dp[2]` is the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, the current value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than the current value of `cakes[j][1]` and the current value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than the current value of `cakes[j][2]`**
