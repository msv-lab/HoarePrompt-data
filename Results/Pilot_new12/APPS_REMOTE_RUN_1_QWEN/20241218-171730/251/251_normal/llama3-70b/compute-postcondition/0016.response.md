The code `dp[i] = cakes[i][0]` updates the `dp` array with the volume of the `i-th` cake from the `cakes` list. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `dp[0]` is the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list, and all other elements in `dp` are `0.0`.

After executing `dp[i] = cakes[i][0]`:

- `dp[i]` is now equal to `cakes[i][0]`, which is the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list since `i` is 1.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as 1.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- All other elements in `dp` remain `0.0`.

Thus, the updated states are:

- `i` is 1.
- `dp[1]` is the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- All other elements in `dp` are `0.0`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `dp[1]` is the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list, `n` must be greater than 1, all other elements in `dp` are 0.0**
