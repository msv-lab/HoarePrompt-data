Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `dp[2]` is the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` ranges from 0 to 1.
   - The condition `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` must hold true for `j` in the range of 0 to 1.
   - `dp[3] = cakes[3][0]`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop `for j in range(i):` will execute if `j` ranges from 0 to 1 and the condition `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` holds true.

3. **Analyzing the Condition**:
   - Since `i` is 3, the loop will check the condition for `j` values 0 and 1.
   - For `j = 0`, the condition `cakes[3][1] < cakes[0][1] and cakes[3][2] < cakes[0][2]` must hold true.
   - For `j = 1`, the condition `cakes[3][1] < cakes[1][1] and cakes[3][2] < cakes[1][2]` must hold true.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that both conditions hold true for either `j = 0` or `j = 1` (or both).
   - The value of `dp[3]` is already set as `cakes[3][0]` and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - The initial values of `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]` do not directly affect the loop but need to be consistent with the given conditions.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the conditions involving `cakes[i][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` for `j = 0` and `j = 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`dp[2]` is the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`, `i` is 3, `j` ranges from 0 to 1, the condition `cakes[3][1] < cakes[0][1] and cakes[3][2] < cakes[0][2]` must hold true for `j = 0`, the condition `cakes[3][1] < cakes[1][1] and cakes[3][2] < cakes[1][2]` must hold true for `j = 1`, `dp[3] = cakes[3][0]`**.
