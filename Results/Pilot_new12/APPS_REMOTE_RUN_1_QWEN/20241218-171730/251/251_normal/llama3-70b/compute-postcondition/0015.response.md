Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial state:**
   - The loop variable is `i`, and the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - Before the loop starts, `i` should be 1.

2. **Determine the required state of `n`:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute.

3. **Consider the state of the `cakes` list:**
   - The `cakes` list is already described as being a list of tuples sorted in reverse order by their calculated volume. No additional state needs to be adjusted for this part.

4. **Examine the `dp` array:**
   - `dp[0]` is the volume of the first cake in the `cakes` list, and all other elements in `dp` are `0.0`.
   - This state is already correct for the loop to start executing.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` must be 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the final answer is:
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**.
