Postcondition: **`dp[2]` is the maximum value between `dp[2]` and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and the condition `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` is checked. If the condition is true, `dp[2]` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change under any other condition.**
