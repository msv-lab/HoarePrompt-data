Postcondition: **`i` is `n-2`, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, and `dp[0]` remains `volumes[0]`, `volumes` remains unchanged, `j` exists such that the volume at index `j` in `volumes` is less than the volume at index `i`, and `i` must still be greater than or equal to 1**
