Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is a non-negative integer equal to `n-1`.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`.
   - `dp[0]` remains `volumes[0]`.
   - `volumes` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 0` and goes up to `i = n-1`.
   - After the first iteration (when `i` is `n-1`), the loop will proceed to the next value of `i`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop will now start from `i = n-1` and proceed to `i = n-2`, we need to adjust the state accordingly.
   - The variable `i` will now be `n-2`.
   - The list `dp` will remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, `dp[0]` remains `volumes[0]`, and `volumes` remains unchanged.**
