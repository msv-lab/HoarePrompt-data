Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `dp[2]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[2]` and `dp[j] + volumes[2]`, and the value of `volumes` remains unchanged. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[2]` is set to `dp[1] + volumes[2]`. Otherwise, the original value of `dp[2]` is retained.***
