Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The key issues identified are:

1. **Flawed Helper Function (`func_1`)**: The logic in `func_1` for calculating the optimal position of the heat source and determining whether at least `K` pieces of meat can be cooked within a given time `T` is incorrect. The calculation of `(mx, my)` and the condition `if d * d2 > d2:` do not correctly determine the optimal placement of the heat source.

2. **Reliance on Incorrect Logic**: The `func_2` function uses the binary search approach to find the minimum time `T`, but since `func_1` is flawed, the binary search may not converge to the correct solution. Even if `func_1` were corrected, the binary search might still miss the optimal time due to the inherent flaws in the helper function.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered correct based on the problem description and the provided code. The output hints confirm that the program processes the input correctly up to the point of calling `func_2`, but since `func_2` relies on an incorrect `func_1`, the overall program will not produce the correct result.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program should be deemed incorrect.
