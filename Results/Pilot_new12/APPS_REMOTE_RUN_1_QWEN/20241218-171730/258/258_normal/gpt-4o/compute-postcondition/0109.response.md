The code updates the value of `d2` to be the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. Given the initial values:

- `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy = (y1 - y2) / 2`

We substitute these into the equation for `d2`:

\[ d2 = \left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2 \]

Since the other variables remain unchanged, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is the value of `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is the value of `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is the value of `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][0]`, `y2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][1]`, `c2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][2]`, `d` remains unchanged, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `my` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, `cx` remains unchanged, `cy` is equal to \((y1 + y2) / 2\).**
