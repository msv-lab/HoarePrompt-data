Postcondition: ***`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i][2]` (or `meats[j][2]` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`), `x2` is `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is `meats[j][2]` (if `c1 * T < c2 * T`), `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `my` is `cy - dx \cdot \frac{\mathbf{math.sqrt(d2 \cdot d - d^2)}}{d2}`, `count` remains unchanged. If `d < 0`, the condition is directly satisfied and no further changes occur. Since there is no else part, the values remain as they are when entering the if block.***
