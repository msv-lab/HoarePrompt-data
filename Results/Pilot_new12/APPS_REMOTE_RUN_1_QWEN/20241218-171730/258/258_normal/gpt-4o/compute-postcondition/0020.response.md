The code assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to the variable `c`. Given the initial state, `index` is 8, so `data[index + 2]` corresponds to `data[10]`. Since `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `data[10]` is a string. The value of `c` is converted to an integer using `int()`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing two elements which are the tuple (`x`, `y`, `c`), `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 0, `index` is 8, `x` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**
