`cx` is assigned the value of `(x1 + x2) / 2`. From the initial state, we know `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`. Therefore, `x1` is equal to `y1` and `x2` is equal to `y2`. Hence, `cx` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `y1`, `y2` is `x1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0, `cx` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`**
