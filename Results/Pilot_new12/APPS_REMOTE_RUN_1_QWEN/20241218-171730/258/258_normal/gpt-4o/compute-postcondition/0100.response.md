Postcondition: ***`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is the value of `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is the value of `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is the value of `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][0]`, `y2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][1]`, `c2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][2]`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, this condition holds. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
