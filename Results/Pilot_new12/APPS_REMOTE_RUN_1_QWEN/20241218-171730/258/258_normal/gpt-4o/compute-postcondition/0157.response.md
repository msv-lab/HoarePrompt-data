The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, the provided code does not indicate which loop this statement belongs to, so we will assume it is within a loop that iterates over the `meats` list. Given the conditions and the fact that the `if` condition \(d * d2 > d2\) is true, we know that the loop would continue without further changes to the variables.

Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`, `y2` is `meats[N][1]`, `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`, `c2` is `meats[N][2]`, `count` is the number of meat entries within distance `T` if a valid combination is found, otherwise it is the maximum number of meat entries checked during the loop, `d` is \((c1_val - c2_val) * T / (c1_val * c2_val)\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `cx`, `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `mx`, `my` hold the values calculated for the last pair of meat entries compared, `j` is `N`, `c1_val` is `meats[N-1][2]`, `c2_val` is `meats[N][2]`, and the loop continues.**
