The code assigns the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2` to `cy`. Since `y1` is equal to `x1` and `y2` is equal to `x2`, we can substitute these values into the expression. Therefore, the value of `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `x1`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `y1`, `y2` is `x1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0, `cx` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `cy` is `(x1 + x2) / 2**
