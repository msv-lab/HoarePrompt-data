The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not include a loop, so the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `N` is greater than `k + 2`, `x1` is `x2`, `y1` is `y2`, `c1` is `c2`, `x2` is `y1`, `y2` is `x1`, `c2` is `c1`, `d` is 0**
