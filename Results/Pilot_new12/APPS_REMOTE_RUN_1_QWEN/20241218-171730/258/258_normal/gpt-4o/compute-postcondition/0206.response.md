Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, `cy`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, and `K` retain their original meanings. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True. Otherwise, no specific action is taken and the postcondition remains unchanged.***
