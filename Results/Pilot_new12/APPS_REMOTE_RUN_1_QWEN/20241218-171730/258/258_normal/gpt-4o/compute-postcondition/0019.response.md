The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `y`. Given that `index` is 8, `data[index + 1]` corresponds to `data[9]`. Since `y` is the integer value of `data[6]` in the initial state, we need to determine the new value of `y` by converting `data[9]` to an integer.

Given the initial conditions:
- `x` is the integer value of `data[5]` or `int(data[index])`, and since `index` is 8, `x` is also the integer value of `data[8]`.
- `y` is the integer value of `data[6]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[7]`.

After executing the code, `y` will be updated to the integer value of `data[9]`.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing two elements which are the tuple (`x`, `y`, `c`), `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 0, `index` is 8, `x` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[7]`**
