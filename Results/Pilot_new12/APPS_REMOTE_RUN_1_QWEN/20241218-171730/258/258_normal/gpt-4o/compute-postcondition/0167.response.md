The code snippet assigns new values to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` from the list `meats[j]`. This means that the values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are updated to the corresponding values from the `j`-th entry in the `meats` list. However, the values of the other variables (`i`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `y2`, `c2`, `count`, `d`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `cx`, and `my`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `N`; `x1` is `meats[N-1][0]`; `y1` is `meats[N-1][1]`; `c1` is `meats[N-1][2]`; `y2` is `meats[j][1]`; `c2` is `meats[j][2]`; `count` is the sum of `c` for each entry `(x, y, c)` in `meats` such that the distance between `(x, y)` and `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`; `d` is \((c1_val - c2_val) \cdot T / (c1_val \cdot c2_val)\); `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\); `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\); `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\); `cx` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\); `my` is greater than \((y1 + y2) / 2 - (x1 - x2) / 2 * math.sqrt(d2)`**
