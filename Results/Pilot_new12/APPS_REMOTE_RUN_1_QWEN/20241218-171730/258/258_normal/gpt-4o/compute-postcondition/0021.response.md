The code appends a new tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. Before the execution, `meats` contains one tuple (`K`, `data[1]`). After the execution, `meats` will contain both the original tuple and the new tuple `(x, y, c)`. The values of `K`, `data`, `N`, `index`, `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing two elements which are the tuples (`K`, `data[1]`) and (`x`, `y`, `c`), `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` must be greater than 0, `index` is 8, `x` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**
