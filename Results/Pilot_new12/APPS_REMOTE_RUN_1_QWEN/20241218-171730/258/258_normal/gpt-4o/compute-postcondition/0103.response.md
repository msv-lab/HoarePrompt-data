Postcondition: ***`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is the value of `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is the value of `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is the value of `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][0]`, `y2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][1]`, `c2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][2]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T` (a negative value), `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged. Since the if condition `d < 0` is satisfied in the if part and there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the precondition.***
