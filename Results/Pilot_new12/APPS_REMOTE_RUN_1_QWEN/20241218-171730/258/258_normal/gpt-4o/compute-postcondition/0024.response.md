The code `result = func_2(N, K, meats)` calls the function `func_2` with the arguments `N`, `K`, and `meats`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged because the function call does not modify them in place. The variable `result` is assigned the return value of `func_2`, but since `func_2` is not defined here, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, the output state includes the updated assignment of `result`.

Output State: **`K` is the integer obtained from `data[1]`, `meats` is a list containing `N` elements each of which is a tuple `(x, y, c)`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split input, `N` is the integer value obtained from `int(data[0])`, `index` is `3 * N + 2`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`**.
