`dx` is assigned the value `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The values of `x1` and `x2` are known, so we can calculate `dx` specifically. All other variables remain unchanged except that `cy` is now equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.

Let's calculate `dx`:
- `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2`

And update `cy`:
- `cy = (y1 + y2) / 2`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `x1` is the value of `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is the value of `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is the value of `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][0]`, `y2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][1]`, `c2` is the value of `meats[k + 2][2]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` remains unchanged, `d2` remains unchanged, `my` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, `cx` remains unchanged, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
