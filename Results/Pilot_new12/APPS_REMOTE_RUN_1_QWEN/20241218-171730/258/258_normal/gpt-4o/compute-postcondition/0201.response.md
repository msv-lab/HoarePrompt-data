Postcondition: ***`x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is `meats[N][0]`, `y2` is `meats[N][1]`, `c2` is `meats[N][2]`, `count` is the sum of `c` for each entry `(x, y, c)` in `meats` such that the distance between `(x, y)` and `(mx, my)` is less than or equal to `T`, `d` is \(\frac{(c1 - c2) \cdot T}{c1 \cdot c2}\), `dx` is \(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\), `dy` is \(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\), `d2` is \(\left(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\right)\), `cx` is \(\frac{x1 + x2}{2}\), `cy` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2}\). If `d * d2 > d2`, no change is made to the variables. Otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables since there is no else part.***
