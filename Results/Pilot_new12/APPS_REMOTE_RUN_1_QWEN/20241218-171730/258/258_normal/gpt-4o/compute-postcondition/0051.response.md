The code swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. Initially, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are `meats[i][0]`, `meats[i][1]`, `meats[i][2]`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are `meats[j][0]`, `meats[j][1]`, `meats[j][2]`.

After the swap, the new values are:
- `x1` becomes `x2`
- `y1` becomes `y2`
- `c1` becomes `c2`
- `x2` becomes `x1`
- `y2` becomes `y1`
- `c2` becomes `c1`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j + 1`, `x1` is `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is `meats[j][2]`, `x2` is `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is `meats[i][2]`, `d`, `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `cy`, `dx` are as defined.**
