The `times` list is populated with values from `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\). Afterward, the `sort()` method is called on `times`, which sorts the list in ascending order. However, since the exact values returned by `func_2` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact sorted values of `times`. The only information we know is that `times` is now a sorted list of the values returned by `func_2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -999, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is a sorted list of values returned by `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is a sorted list of values returned by `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\)**.
