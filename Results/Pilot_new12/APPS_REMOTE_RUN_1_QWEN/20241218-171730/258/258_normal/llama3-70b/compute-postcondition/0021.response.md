The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` is executed, which means the function `func_2` is called with the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Given the initial state, `x` is -999 and `y` is the next integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\) (i.e., -999 + 1 = -998). The function `func_2` returns a list of values for these inputs, and this list is assigned to `times`. Since the exact values returned by `func_2` are not specified, we denote the returned list as `times`.

The value of `ans` is then updated to be the minimum of its current value and the last element of the `times` list. However, the initial value of `ans` is not given, so we denote it as `ans_initial`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -998
- `times` is a list returned by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is a list returned by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`**
