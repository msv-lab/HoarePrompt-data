The code initializes `ans` to positive infinity. However, the code snippet provided does not perform any operations on the variables `x`, `y`, or `ans`. It simply sets `ans` to `float('inf')`, which is already its initial state. Since no other operations are performed, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is float('inf'), `x` is an integer within the range [-1000, 1000], `y` is an integer within the range [-1000, 1000]**
