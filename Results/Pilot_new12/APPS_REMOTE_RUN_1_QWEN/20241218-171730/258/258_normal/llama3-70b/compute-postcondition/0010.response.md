According to the given for loop statement, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive) for the variable `y`. The loop condition for each iteration is based on the value of `y`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is 1000
- `times` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `y` must be within the specified range. Since the current value of `y` is 1000, the next value of `y` would be 1001, but 1001 is not included in the range `-1000 to 1000`.

Therefore, the loop will not execute again because the loop condition `y in range(-1000, 1001)` is not satisfied with `y = 1001`.

However, if we assume the loop body modifies some states (even though it is omitted), we can still state the updated states as follows:

- `ans` remains `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`
- `x` remains -1000
- `y` remains 1000
- `times` remains `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`

Since the loop does not execute again, no changes are made to these states.

State: **`ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, `times` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`**
