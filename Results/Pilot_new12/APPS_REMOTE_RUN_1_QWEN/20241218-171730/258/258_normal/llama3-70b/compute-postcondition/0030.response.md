To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and analyze the requirements for the loop to start executing.

### Given Information:
- **State before the loop starts**: 
  - `x` is -998.
  - `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
  - `times` is a sorted list of values returned by `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)` for each `y` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
  - `ans` is the minimum value among the K-th largest elements of the list `times` for each `y`.

- **For Loop**:
  ```python
  for y in range(-1000, 1001):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `y`**:
   - The loop iterates over `y` from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive).
   - This means `y` must take every value in this range at least once for the loop to complete all iterations.

2. **List `times`**:
   - For each `y`, `times` is a list of values returned by `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)`.
   - Since `times` is sorted, it implies that for each `y`, there is a well-defined list of values generated.

3. **Variable `ans`**:
   - `ans` is defined as the minimum value among the K-th largest elements of the list `times` for each `y`.
   - For this calculation to be valid, `times` must contain at least K elements, and `K` must be a positive integer.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute correctly, we need to ensure that:
- The variable `y` iterates through all possible values in the specified range.
- The list `times` is properly generated and contains enough elements to allow the K-th largest element to be computed.

### Adjusted States:
- `y` must iterate over all values in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
- `times` must be a non-empty list for each `y` and must contain at least K elements.

### Final State:
State: **`x` is -998, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is a non-empty list for each `y` and contains at least K elements, `ans` is not yet defined but will be computed after the loop based on the K-th largest elements of `times` for each `y`**.
