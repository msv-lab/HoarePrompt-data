The code `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` is trying to assign the minimum value between `ans` and `times[K - 1]` to `ans`. However, since `ans` is not defined initially, it is equivalent to assigning `times[K - 1]` to `ans`.

- The value of `x` remains `-998`.
- The value of `y` remains within the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
- The list `times` remains sorted in ascending order and contains at least `K` elements.
- The variable `ans` is now assigned the value of `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is an integer within the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `times` is a non-empty list for each `y` and contains at least `K` elements (sorted in ascending order), `ans` is `times[K - 1]`**
