`times` is a list returned by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`. After calling `func_2`, `times` contains elements that are results from this function call. The code sorts `times` in ascending order. The exact values in `times` depend on what `func_2` returns, but they are sorted now. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `ans`) are not affected by this sorting operation.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is a list sorted in ascending order by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`**
