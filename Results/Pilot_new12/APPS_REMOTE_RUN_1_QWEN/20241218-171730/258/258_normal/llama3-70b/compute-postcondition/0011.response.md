The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` calls the function `func_2` with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Since the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values that `times` will take. However, we know that `times` will be reassigned the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. The values of `ans`, `x`, `y`, and `times` before the function call are known.

Output State: **`ans` is `[-1000, -1000, 1000, 1000]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`**
