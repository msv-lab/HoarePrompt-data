Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is -999
   - `y` is -998
   - `times` is a list sorted in ascending order by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`
   - `ans` is the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`
   - `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for y in range(-1000, 1001):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `y` from -1000 to 1000 inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is -998.
   - For the next iteration, `y` needs to be incremented by 1, making it -997.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the only variable that changes within this loop is `y`, we need to adjust `y` to -997.
   - The other variables (`x`, `times`, and `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop itself.

5. **Final State:**
   - `x` remains -999
   - `y` is now -997
   - `times` remains as it was, sorted in ascending order by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`
   - `ans` remains as it was, being the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`, and having been updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`

**Answer:**
State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -997, `times` is a list sorted in ascending order by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`, and has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`**
