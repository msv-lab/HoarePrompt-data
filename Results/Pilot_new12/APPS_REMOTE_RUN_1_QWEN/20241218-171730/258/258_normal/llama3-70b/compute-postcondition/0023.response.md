The initial state is:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -998
- `times` is a list sorted in ascending order by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`
- `ans` is the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`

The code snippet updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the last element of the `times` list.

Since the exact content of the `times` list is not specified and only that it is sorted in ascending order by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, we cannot determine the exact value of `times[K - 1]`. However, we know that `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -998
- `times` is a list sorted in ascending order by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`
- `ans` is the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`, and has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `times` is a list sorted in ascending order by `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans_initial` and the last element of `times`, and has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`**
