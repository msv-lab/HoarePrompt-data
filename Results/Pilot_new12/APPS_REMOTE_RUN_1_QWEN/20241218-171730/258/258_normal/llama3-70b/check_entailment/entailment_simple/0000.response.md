Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the main issue lies in how the heat source coordinates \( (X, Y) \) are being handled. In the original problem, \( (X, Y) \) should be optimized to minimize the time required for \( K \) or more pieces of meat to be ready. However, the current implementation fixes \( (X, Y) \) to the same coordinates in `func_3`, which is \( (x, y) \) from the iteration variables. This means the program only checks the time required for the \( K \)-th smallest time when the heat source is placed at each possible integer coordinate pair from \([-1000, 1000]\). This is a significant simplification and does not guarantee the optimal solution.

To properly solve the problem, the heat source coordinates \( (X, Y) \) should be continuously adjusted to find the configuration that minimizes the time for \( K \) or more pieces of meat to be ready. The current approach limits the search space to only integer coordinates and uses the \( K \)-th smallest time from each combination, which may not lead to the global minimum.

Hereâ€™s a brief outline of what needs to be done to correct the program:

1. **Use a continuous optimization method**: Instead of iterating over integer coordinates, the program should use a method like gradient descent or a similar optimization algorithm to find the optimal \( (X, Y) \).

2. **Calculate the correct times**: Ensure that the calculation of the cooking times for each piece of meat correctly uses the distance formula and hardness values.

3. **Find the optimal heat source position**: Implement an optimization loop to adjust \( (X, Y) \) to minimize the time required for \( K \) or more pieces of meat to be ready.

In summary, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the optimal heat source position and the corresponding minimum time to have \( K \) or more pieces of meat ready. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
