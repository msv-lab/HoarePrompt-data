The code `print('Yes')` simply prints the string 'Yes' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `x`, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers entered by the user, each between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), with the same length as `x`, `total_x` is the sum of the elements in the list `x`, `total_y` is the sum of the elements in the list `y`, and `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, and the string 'Yes' is printed to the console.**
