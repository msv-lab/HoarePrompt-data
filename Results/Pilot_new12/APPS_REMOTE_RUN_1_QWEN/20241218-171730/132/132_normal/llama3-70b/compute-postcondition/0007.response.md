The code snippet `y.sort()` sorts the list `y`. Since `y` is a list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers, sorting it does not change its length or the conversion from the input integers. However, the order of elements within `y` will be changed.

The sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, which remains unchanged. The initial state of `n` being an integer input from the user and `x` being a sorted list of integers of length `n` also remains unchanged.

Therefore, after executing the code, the list `y` is sorted, while `x`, `n`, and the sum condition remain as they were.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is a sorted list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers, the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`, and `y` is sorted.**
