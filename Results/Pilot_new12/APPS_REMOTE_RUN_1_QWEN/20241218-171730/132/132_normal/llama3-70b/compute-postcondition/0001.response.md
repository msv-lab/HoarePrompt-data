The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer input from the user, and the lengths of `x` and `y` are both `n`. After executing the code, `x` will be updated to a list of integers of length `n` derived from the input, while `n` remains unchanged, and `y` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` derived from the input, and `y` is a list of length `n` with undefined values**
