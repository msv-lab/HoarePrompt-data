Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, and `y` is a list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers. If the sum of elements in list `x` is not equal to the sum of elements in list `y`, the console prints 'No'. Otherwise, `x` is sorted, and `y` is also sorted. If `x` equals `y`, the console displays 'Yes'. Otherwise, the console displays 'No'.***
