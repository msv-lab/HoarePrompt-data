The code `y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. The length of this list will be equal to `n`, which was previously defined as an integer input by the user. The `x` list remains unchanged.

Let's assume the user inputs a line of space-separated integers, for example, "1 2 3". After executing the code, `y` will be assigned the list `[1, 2, 3]` and `n` will remain the length of this list, which is 3. The original list `x` will remain unchanged.

Since the exact input is not specified, let's generalize the answer based on the precondition and the operation performed:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` derived from the input, and `y` is a list of length `n` with elements converted from the input integers**.
