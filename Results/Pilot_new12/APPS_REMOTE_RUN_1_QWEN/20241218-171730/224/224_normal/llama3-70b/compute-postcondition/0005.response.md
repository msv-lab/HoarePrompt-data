The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. However, without knowing the initial value of `dp` or the specific index `j` being referred to, we can only say that `dp[j]` is now the sum of its previous value and `dp[j - 1]`.

Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, and `f_max_n` must be at least 2, these variables are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, they remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `f_max_n` must be at least 2, `dp[j]` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `dp[j - 1]`**
