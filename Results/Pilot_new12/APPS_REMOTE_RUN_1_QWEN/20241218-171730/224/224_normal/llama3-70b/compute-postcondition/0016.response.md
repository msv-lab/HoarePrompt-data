The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. However, the initial values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only say that `dp[j]` has been updated to include the value of `dp[j - 1]`.

Output State: **`dp[j]` is updated to include the value of `dp[j - 1]`, `dp[j - 1]` retains its original value**
