The code snippet `dp[j] %= MOD` modifies each element `dp[j]` in the range from `1` to `f_max_n` such that it is the result of `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`. This operation does not change the value of `dp[0]` and does not affect the value of `f_max_n` or `i`.

The initial state includes:
- `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.
- `dp[0]` retains its original value.
- `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `k + 1`.

After executing `dp[j] %= MOD` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n`, the values of `dp[j]` for `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` are updated to their respective values modulo `MOD`, but `dp[0]` remains unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`, `dp[0]` retains its original value, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 1`**
