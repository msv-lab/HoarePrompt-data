The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n` and `f_max_n`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `f_max_n` is the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n as defined in the problem description.

After executing the function body, the function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[f_max_n]` modulo 1000000007.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two parameters `n` and `f_max_n`, and return the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[f_max_n]` modulo 1000000007.
