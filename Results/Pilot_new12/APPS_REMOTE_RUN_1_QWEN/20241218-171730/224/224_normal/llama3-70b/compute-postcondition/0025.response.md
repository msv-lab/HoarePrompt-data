Let's analyze the given information and the for loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j-1]` modulo `MOD`.
- `dp[0]` retains its original value.
- `f_max_n` retains its original value.
- The for loop is as follows:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the Start of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j-1]` modulo `MOD`.
   - `dp[0]` retains its original value.
   - `f_max_n` retains its original value.

2. **Condition for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute again if `i < n + 1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `k` where `1 â‰¤ k < n + 1`.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

4. **Modifying the States:**
   - The value of `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations modify these values.
   - `dp[0]` retains its original value.
   - `f_max_n` retains its original value.

5. **New State:**
   - The new value of `i` will be `k + 1`, where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j-1]` modulo `MOD`, `dp[0]` retains its original value, `f_max_n` retains its original value, `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration)**. 

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can generalize it as:
State: **`dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j-1]` modulo `MOD`, `dp[0]` retains its original value, `f_max_n` retains its original value, `i` is `k + 1`**, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
