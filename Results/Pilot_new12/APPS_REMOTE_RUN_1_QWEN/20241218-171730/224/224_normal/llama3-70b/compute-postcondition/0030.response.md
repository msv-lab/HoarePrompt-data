The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates each `dp[j]` (for `j` from `1` to `f_max_n`) by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Since `dp[j]` was originally the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`, adding `dp[j - 1]` to `dp[j]` means that the new value of `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j + 1]` modulo `MOD`.

The initial state is that `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`, and `dp[0]` retains its original value. The code snippet modifies `dp[j]` for `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` but does not affect `dp[0]` or `f_max_n` or `i`.

Since `dp[j]` for `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is now the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j + 1]` modulo `MOD`, the only change is in the values of `dp[j]` for `j` from `1` to `f_max_n`. For each `j`, `dp[j]` is now the sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j + 1]` modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[0]` retains its original value, `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j + 1]` modulo `MOD`, `f_max_n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `k + 1`**
