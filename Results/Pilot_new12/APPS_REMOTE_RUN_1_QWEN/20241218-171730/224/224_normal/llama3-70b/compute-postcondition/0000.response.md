The code initializes a constant `MOD` with the value \(10^9 + 7\). This value does not affect the existing variables `n` or `f_max_n`. The only change is the introduction of the new constant `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `f_max_n` is the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n as defined in the problem description; `MOD` is 1000000007**
