The code snippet `dp[j] %= MOD` updates each element in the `dp` array from index 1 to `f_max_n` by taking the modulus with `MOD`. This operation does not affect the other variables, such as `dp[0]`, `f_max_n`, `i`, or `k`.

Since the initial state specifies that `dp[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of `dp[0]` to `dp[j + 1]` modulo `MOD`, and now each `dp[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`) is updated to be `dp[j] % MOD`, the new value of each `dp[j]` is simply `dp[j] % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is: `dp[0]` retains its original value, `dp[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n` is `dp[j] % MOD`, `f_max_n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `k + 1`.

Output State: **`dp[0]` retains its original value, `dp[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n` is `dp[j] % MOD`, `f_max_n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `k + 1`**
