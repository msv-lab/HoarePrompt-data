Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
- The code correctly implements the function `func_2` to find `f_max_n`, which is the maximum value of \( f(p) \) for permutations of length \( n \). This is done by iterating through all possible prefixes and calculating their GCDs using `func_1`.
- The function `func_3` correctly calculates the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \). It uses dynamic programming to accumulate the counts, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code handles the edge cases properly, such as when \( n = 2 \) and the maximum GCD value is small. The annotations correctly summarize the states and behaviors of the functions, which match the problem description.
- There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases that the code does not handle, and the provided annotations do not indicate any discrepancies with the problem description.

Therefore, the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
