Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not address the core task of counting permutations of length \( n \) where \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \).

- `func_1` computes the GCD of two numbers.
- `func_2` computes the maximum number of distinct GCD values for a permutation of length \( n \), but it does not generate permutations or count them.
- `func_3` seems to be intended to compute something related to dynamic programming, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to count permutations.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
1. Determine \( f_{max}(n) \).
2. Generate and count permutations of length \( n \) where \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \).

Since the provided functions do not fulfill these requirements, the program is incorrect.
