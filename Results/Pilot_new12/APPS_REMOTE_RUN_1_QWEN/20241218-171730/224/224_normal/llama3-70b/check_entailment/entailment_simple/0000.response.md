Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the required function \(f(p)\) and does not solve the problem as described. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Function \(f(p)\) Implementation**: 
   - The function \(f(p)\) is not implemented in the provided code. The annotated functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not compute \(f(p)\) as per the problem description.
   - Function `func_1` computes the GCD of two numbers, which is useful for computing \(f(p)\), but this is not enough to fully implement \(f(p)\).
   - Function `func_2` computes \(f_{max}(n)\), which is the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for any permutation of length \(n\). However, the annotated code states that `func_2` is called `f_max_n`, but it does not actually return \(f_{max}(n)\) as computed in the problem description.
   - Function `func_3` attempts to count the number of permutations with \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\), but it does not use the correct logic to achieve this.

2. **Missing \(f(p)\) Computation**:
   - To compute \(f(p)\) as per the problem description, one needs to maintain a running GCD of the prefix of the permutation and keep track of the distinct GCD values. This is not done in the provided code.

3. **Incorrect Approach in `func_3`**:
   - `func_3` uses dynamic programming to count permutations, but it does not correctly implement the logic to generate permutations with the desired property \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\).

### Summary:
- The program does not correctly implement the computation of \(f(p)\) as defined in the problem description.
- The logic in `func_3` is not designed to count permutations with the specific property related to \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\).

Therefore, the program is **incorrect** because it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
