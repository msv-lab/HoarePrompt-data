`k` is incremented by 1 and stored in `k`. The value of `k` is printed along with `1`. Since the initial condition is that \(0 \leq k < 2n - 2\) and the current value of `k` is less than `n - 1`, after executing `k += 1`, the new value of `k` will be between `1` and `2n - 2` (inclusive), but still less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < 2n - 2\)**
