Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the described movement pattern of Lara. Specifically, the code does not handle the snake-like movement pattern correctly after Lara reaches the bottom row and starts moving right, one cell up, to the left to the second column, and repeating this pattern.

To illustrate the issue:

1. **Initial Path Analysis:**
   - For the initial path, Lara moves from (1,1) to (n,1).
   - After reaching (n,1), she starts moving in a snake-like fashion, which means she moves right, one cell up, to the left to the second column, and repeats.

2. **Example Input and Expected Output:**
   - For `n=4` and `m=3`, the path should be as follows:
     - Initial path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1)
     - Snake-like path: (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2)

3. **Testing the Code with Specific Inputs:**
   - For `n=4`, `m=3`, and `k=7`, the expected output is `(3,2)` because Lara's path would be:
     - (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2)
   - However, the provided code outputs `(1,2)` for `k=7`.

4. **Code Issue:**
   - The code uses a modulo operation with `n*2 - 2`, which does not correctly simulate the snake-like movement after reaching the bottom row.
   - The logic for calculating the row and column indices after the initial downward path is incorrect, leading to wrong outputs for certain values of `k`.

Since the code does not handle the snake-like movement correctly, it fails to produce the correct output for at least one case, making the program incorrect.
