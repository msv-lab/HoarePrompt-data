The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. The constraints are that `n` is an even positive integer, `m` is an odd positive integer, both such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\). 

The function's output is not specified in terms of a return value but rather described through possible cases, which implies that the function might handle different scenarios based on the input values.

Based on the given output structure, we infer two possible return cases, though the specific return values are not provided:

- Case_1: The function returns some value or result related to the parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` when certain conditions are met.
- Case_2: The function returns a different value or result under other conditions.

Since the exact return values are not specified, we can summarize the function's behavior in terms of its parameters and the nature of its return based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an even positive integer), `m` (an odd positive integer), and `k` (an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\)), and returns a value based on the specific conditions that are not detailed here.**
