Postcondition: **`n` is an even positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `m` is an odd positive integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < nm - (n - 1)\) and \(k \geq n - 1\); `full_rows` is \(k // (m - 1)\); `remaining_steps` is \(k \% (m - 1)\); `full_rows` is an odd integer.**
