Postcondition: ***`i` is `mid + 2`, `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost, `min_cost` is the current value of `cost`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the sum of the minimum distances between each element in `sticks` and either `i` or `i-1`. If the cost is less than `min_cost`, then `min_t` is updated to `mid + 2` and `min_cost` is updated to the current value of `cost`.***
