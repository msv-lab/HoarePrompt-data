The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `mid - 2`. The other variables (`cost` and `min_cost`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `cost` remains the sum of `min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`, and the value of `min_cost` remains the value of `cost`.

Output State: **`i` is `mid - 2`, `min_t` is `i`, `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1)))` for each `x` in `sticks`, and `min_cost` is the value of `cost`.**
