The code `print(min_t, min_cost)` prints the values of `min_t` and `min_cost`. However, this does not change the values of the variables themselves. The values of `min_t` and `min_cost` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 100, `min_t` is the value of `i` that minimizes the cost, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `t` is equal to `mid`, and `cost` is the last calculated cost when `i` is 100.**
