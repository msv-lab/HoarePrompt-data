The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, since no specific input is provided in the initial state, the variable `n` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) as per the initial state. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000**
