The line `min_cost = cost` assigns the value of `cost` to `min_cost`. This does not change the values of `i`, `sticks`, `min_t`, or any other variables, only that `min_cost` now holds the value of `cost`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `min_cost` and retains the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is `mid - 3`, `min_cost` is the value of `cost`, `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (mid - 3)), abs(x - (mid - 2)))` for each `x` in `sticks`, `min_t` is either set to `mid - 3` or remains unchanged**
