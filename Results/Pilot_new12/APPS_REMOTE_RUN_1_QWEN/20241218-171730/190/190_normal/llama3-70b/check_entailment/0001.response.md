Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all stick lengths are already almost good for some $t$. Specifically, the program calculates the median stick length as a candidate for $t$ and then checks neighboring values. However, if all stick lengths are already within 1 unit of each other, the program may incorrectly suggest changing lengths instead of choosing the minimum possible cost, which is 0.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 1 2 2 3
```

The output of the program is `2 0`, which is correct. However, if all stick lengths are already within 1 unit of each other, the program should recognize this and output `t` as the median value without any cost. The program should also check if the minimum cost is 0 before suggesting any changes.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check if the minimum cost is 0 before proceeding with further calculations. Hereâ€™s a modified version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    
    # Check if all stick lengths are already almost good for some t
    min_val = min(sticks)
    max_val = max(sticks)
    if max_val - min_val <= 1:
        print(min_val, 0)
        return
    
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        new_cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if new_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = new_cost
            min_t = i
    
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        new_cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if new_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = new_cost
            min_t = i
    
    print(min_t, min_cost)
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle cases where all stick lengths are already almost good for some $t$, ensuring that the minimum cost is 0 if applicable.
