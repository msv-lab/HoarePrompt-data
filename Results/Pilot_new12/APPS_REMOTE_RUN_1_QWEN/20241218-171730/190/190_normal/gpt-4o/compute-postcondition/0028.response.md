Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 1`, `current_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution based on the conditions given, and `length` is the last element in the list `a`. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
