Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`. If the length of `a` is less than `n + 1`, `current_cost` is `t - 1 - len(a)`. Otherwise, `current_cost` is the original value of `current_cost` plus `length - (n + 3)`.***
