According to the code, the loop iterates over `t` from 1 to 100. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `a` is a non-empty list.
- `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost.
- `best_t` is `n + 1`.
- `t` is `n + 2`.
- `current_cost` is the sum of all adjustments made to it based on the conditions within the loop.

The loop updates `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` based on certain conditions. Specifically:
- If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost`, `best_t` is updated to `t`, and `t` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, and `current_cost` retain their initial values.

Since `t` is `n + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `t` would be `n + 3`. For the loop to continue, `t` must be less than or equal to 100. Since `t` is currently `n + 2`, it will be `n + 3` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the loop can execute again if `t` is still within the range (i.e., `n + 3` is less than or equal to 100).

To summarize:
- `a` remains a non-empty list.
- `min_cost` retains its current value unless it is updated.
- `best_t` retains its current value unless it is updated.
- `t` becomes `n + 3`.
- `current_cost` retains its current value unless it is updated.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 3`, and `current_cost` is the sum of all adjustments made to it based on the conditions within the loop.**
