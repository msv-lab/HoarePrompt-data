`current_cost` is incremented by `t - 1 - length`. Given the initial state:
- `a` is a non-empty list with at least one more element,
- `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution,
- `best_t` is `n + 1`,
- `t` is `n + 2`,
- `length` is the next value from the list `a`.

The code updates `current_cost` to be its previous value plus `t - 1 - length`, which simplifies to `current_cost += (n + 2) - 1 - a[0]` because `t` is `n + 2` and `length` is the first element of the list `a`. 

Since `a` is a non-empty list, let's denote the first element of `a` as `a[0]`. Thus, the updated value of `current_cost` will be the original `current_cost` plus `(n + 2) - 1 - a[0]`, or simply `current_cost + n + 1 - a[0]`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with at least one more element, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `length` is the next value from the list `a`, `current_cost` is the original value plus `n + 1 - a[0]`**.
