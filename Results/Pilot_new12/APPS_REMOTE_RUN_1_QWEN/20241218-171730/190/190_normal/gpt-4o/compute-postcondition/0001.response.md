`a` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `n` remains as the integer input provided by the user, and the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) is maintained. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers; `n` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000.**
