Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, and the length of `a` is adjusted such that if the length of `a` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is incremented by the difference between the current length of `a` and `t + 1`. If the length of `a` is not greater than `t + 1`, the value of `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
