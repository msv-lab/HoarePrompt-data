The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it into an integer before assigning it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), the value of `n` will be updated to the input integer within this range. The value of `a` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.**
