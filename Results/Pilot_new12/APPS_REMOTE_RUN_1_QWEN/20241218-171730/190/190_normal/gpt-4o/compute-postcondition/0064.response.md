To solve this task, let's break down the conditions and constraints given:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one element.
   - The initial value of `current_cost` is determined based on the length of `a` relative to `t`.
     - If `len(a) < t - 1`, then `current_cost = t - 1 - len(a)`.
     - If `len(a) > t + 1`, then `current_cost` is incremented by `len(a) - (t + 1)`.
     - Otherwise, `current_cost` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `a`.

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Case 1: `len(a) < t - 1`
- In this case, `current_cost = t - 1 - len(a)`.
- When we move to the next element in `a`, `len(a)` increases by 1.
- For the loop to continue, `len(a) < t - 1` must still hold true.
- Therefore, after processing one more element, `len(a) = len(a) + 1`, but it should still be less than `t - 1`.

Since the condition for continuing the loop is `len(a) < t - 1`, and `len(a)` increases by 1, the new condition becomes `len(a) + 1 < t - 1` or `len(a) < t - 2`.

- If `len(a) < t - 1`, then `current_cost = t - 1 - len(a)`. After processing one more element, `len(a)` increases by 1, and the new condition for `current_cost` remains valid as long as `len(a) < t - 2`.

#### Case 2: `len(a) > t + 1`
- In this case, `current_cost` is incremented by `len(a) - (t + 1)`.
- When we move to the next element in `a`, `len(a)` increases by 1.
- For the loop to continue, `len(a) > t + 1` must still hold true.
- Therefore, after processing one more element, `len(a) = len(a) + 1`, but it should still be greater than `t + 1`.

Since the condition for continuing the loop is `len(a) > t + 1`, and `len(a)` increases by 1, the new condition becomes `len(a) + 1 > t + 1` or `len(a) > t + 2`.

- If `len(a) > t + 1`, then `current_cost` is incremented by `len(a) - (t + 1)`. After processing one more element, `len(a)` increases by 1, and the new condition for `current_cost` remains valid as long as `len(a) > t + 2`.

#### Case 3: `len(a) <= t + 1`
- In this case, `current_cost` remains unchanged.
- When we move to the next element in `a`, `len(a)` increases by 1.
- For the loop to continue, `len(a) <= t + 1` must still hold true.
- Therefore, after processing one more element, `len(a) = len(a) + 1`, but it should still be less than or equal to `t + 1`.

Since the condition for continuing the loop is `len(a) <= t + 1`, and `len(a)` increases by 1, the new condition becomes `len(a) + 1 <= t + 1` or `len(a) <= t`.

- If `len(a) <= t + 1`, then `current_cost` remains unchanged. After processing one more element, `len(a)` increases by 1, and the new condition for `current_cost` remains valid as long as `len(a) <= t`.

### Conclusion:
The state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time depend on the length of `a` relative to `t`:

- If `len(a) < t - 1`, then `len(a) < t - 2`.
- If `len(a) > t + 1`, then `len(a) > t + 2`.
- If `len(a) <= t + 1`, then `len(a) <= t`.

Given that `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, and the exact value of `t` is not specified, we can generalize the conditions as follows:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, and `len(a) < t - 2` or `len(a) > t + 2` or `len(a) <= t` depending on the initial conditions.**
