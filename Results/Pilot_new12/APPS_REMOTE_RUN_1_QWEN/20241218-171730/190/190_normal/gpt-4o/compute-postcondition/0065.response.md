`current_cost` is incremented by the value of `t - 1 - len(a)`. The length of the list `a` can be less than `t - 2`, greater than `t + 2`, or less than or equal to `t`. Since the length of `a` affects the value being added to `current_cost`, the updated value of `current_cost` will depend on the current length of `a`.

Let's denote the length of `a` as `len(a) = l`.

- If `l < t - 2`, then `current_cost += t - 1 - l`.
- If `l > t + 2`, then `current_cost += t - 1 - l`.
- If `l <= t`, then `current_cost += t - 1 - l`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, and `len(a)` is such that it can be less than `t - 2`, greater than `t + 2`, or less than or equal to `t`; `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - len(a)`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, and `len(a)` is such that it can be less than `t - 2`, greater than `t + 2`, or less than or equal to `t`; `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - len(a)`**
