Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty list, `min_cost` is the minimum cumulative cost calculated during the loop execution, `best_t` is `n + 1`, `t` is `n + 2`, `length` is the next value from the list `a`. If `length < t - 1`, `current_cost` is updated by `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`. If `length >= t - 1`, `current_cost` remains unchanged.***
