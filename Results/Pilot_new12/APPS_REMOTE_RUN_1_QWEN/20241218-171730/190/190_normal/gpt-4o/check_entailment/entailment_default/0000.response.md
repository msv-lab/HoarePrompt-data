Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the cost of changing the stick lengths to be almost good for some positive integer \( t \). Specifically, the code calculates the cost using the condition \( length < t - 1 \) or \( length > t + 1 \), which does not align with the requirement that the sticks' lengths should be almost good for some \( t \) (i.e., \( |a_i - t| \leq 1 \)).

To correct this, the code should consider the cost for each stick to be changed to either \( t-1 \) or \( t+1 \) and then choose the \( t \) that minimizes the total cost. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    best_t = -1
    
    # Iterate over all possible values of t from 1 to 100
    for t in range(1, 101):
        current_cost = 0
        for length in a:
            # Calculate the cost to make the length almost good for t
            if length <= t - 1:
                current_cost += (t - 1) - length
            elif length >= t + 1:
                current_cost += length - (t + 1)
        
        # Update the best t and minimum cost if the current cost is lower
        if current_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = current_cost
            best_t = t
    
    print(best_t, min_cost)

func()
```

This corrected code properly handles the requirement that the sticks' lengths should be almost good for some \( t \) and computes the minimum cost accordingly. Therefore, the original code is incorrect.
