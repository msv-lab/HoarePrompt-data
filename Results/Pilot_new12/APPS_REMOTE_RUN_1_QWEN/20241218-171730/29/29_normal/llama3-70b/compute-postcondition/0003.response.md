`name` and `type_` are assigned the values split from the input string. The input string is expected to contain two space-separated values, where the first value is assigned to `name` and the second value is assigned to `type_`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the input operation does not affect it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `name` is a string, `type_` is a string**
