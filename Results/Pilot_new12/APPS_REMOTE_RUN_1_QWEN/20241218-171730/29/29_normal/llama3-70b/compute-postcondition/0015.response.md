The code `script = []` creates an empty list named `script`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regular`). Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `script` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1; `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0; `script` is an empty list**
