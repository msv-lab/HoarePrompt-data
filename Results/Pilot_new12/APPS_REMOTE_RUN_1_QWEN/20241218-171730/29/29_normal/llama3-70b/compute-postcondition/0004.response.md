`files.append((name, int(type_)))` appends a tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the list `files`. The variables `n` and `type_` are converted to an integer, while `name` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `files` with the new tuple and the unchanged variables `n`, `name`, and `type_`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `name` is a string, `type_` is a string; `files` is a list containing tuples, including the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`.**
