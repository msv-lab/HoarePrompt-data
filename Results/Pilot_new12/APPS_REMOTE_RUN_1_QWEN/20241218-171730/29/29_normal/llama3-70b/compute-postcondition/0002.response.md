According to the given code, the loop will iterate `n` times. For the loop to execute, the value of `n` must be at least 1 and at most \(10^5\). The `files` list is initially empty, and the loop body is omitted, so no modifications are needed for the `files` list as long as `n` is within the specified range.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) for the loop to execute.

2. **Variable `files`:**
   - The `files` list is initially empty, and there are no conditions mentioned that would change its state during the loop. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the `files` list.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is the value of `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)**
