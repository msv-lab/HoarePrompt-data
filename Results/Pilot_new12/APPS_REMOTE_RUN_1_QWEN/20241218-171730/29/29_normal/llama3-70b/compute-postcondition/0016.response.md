Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop**: The loop iterates over the `examples` list using `enumerate`, starting the index from 1. Each iteration involves an index `i` and a corresponding `file`.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `n`: An integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `files`: A list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple.
   - `examples`: A list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1.
   - `regular`: A list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0.
   - `script`: An empty list.

3. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `examples` must contain at least one element because `enumerate(examples)` will raise an error if `examples` is empty.
   - The `start=1` parameter means the loop will begin with `i = 1`. Therefore, `examples` must have at least one element to satisfy this condition.

4. **Adjust States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `examples` must have at least one element.
   - There is no explicit mention of the value of `file` or its relationship to `i`, but we know it exists and the loop can proceed as long as `examples` is non-empty.

Based on the above reasoning, the state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `examples` is not empty.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1 and must have at least one element, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0, `script` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
