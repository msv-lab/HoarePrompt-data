To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given information:

1. **`script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `regular` starting from the position `len(examples)`**:
   - This means that `script` must contain at least some elements to ensure the loop can iterate over them.

2. **The length of `script` is printed**:
   - The loop will run as long as there are elements in `script`.

3. **`i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`.

4. **`line in script`**:
   - For the loop to execute, `script` must have at least one element since `line` is taken from `script`.

Given these points, we can conclude that the loop will execute if and only if `script` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `script` must contain at least one element.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0 and must contain at least one element, `script` must contain at least one element, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular)`, and the length of `script` is printed.**
