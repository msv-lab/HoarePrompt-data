Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple.
   - `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1.
   - `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0 and must contain at least one element.
   - `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `examples`.
   - `i` is `len(examples)`.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `regular` starting from `len(examples) + 1` using `enumerate`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `len(examples) + 1` and increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `file` refers to the tuple in `files` at the position corresponding to `i`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the bounds of `regular`.
   - Since `regular` contains at least one element, the loop will continue as long as `i` does not exceed the length of `regular`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(examples) + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` is now `len(examples) + 2`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to the length of `regular`.
   - Hence, `i` should be `len(examples) + 2`.
   - The `file` at this position will be the tuple in `files` at the index `i - 1` (since Python uses zero-based indexing).

6. **Updated States**:
   - `i` is updated to `len(examples) + 2`.
   - `file` is the tuple in `files` at index `len(examples) + 1`.

Based on these steps, the updated states are:

- `n` remains unchanged.
- `files` remains unchanged.
- `examples` remains unchanged.
- `regular` remains unchanged.
- `script` remains unchanged.
- `i` is now `len(examples) + 2`.
- `file` is the tuple in `files` at index `len(examples) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0 and must contain at least one element, `script` is a list containing the moves for all files in `examples`, `i` is `len(examples) + 2**, file is the tuple in `files` at index `len(examples) + 1`.**
