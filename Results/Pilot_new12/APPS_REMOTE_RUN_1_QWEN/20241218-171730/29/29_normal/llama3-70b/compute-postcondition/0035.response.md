According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `script`. The loop will continue as long as `script` contains at least one more line.

At the end of the last iteration, `line` has been printed, and `script` must have had at least two lines. This means that there was at least one line remaining in `script` after printing the current `line`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `script` must contain at least two lines. Since one line has already been printed, `script` must still contain at least one more line.

State: **`line` has been printed, `script` must have at least one more line**
