The code creates a new list `examples` containing the first elements of the tuples in the `files` list where the second element of the tuples is equal to 1. Since the `files` list is sorted in descending order by the second element, only those tuples with the second element equal to 1 will be included in the `examples` list. The `n` variable and the `files` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the second element of each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 1.**
