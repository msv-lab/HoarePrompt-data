Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where examples and regular tests are intermixed within the filenames. The program sorts the files in descending order of their type (examples have type `1` and regular tests have type `0`), which means that examples will be moved to the beginning, but it does not ensure that all regular tests are moved to the end in the correct order. 

For instance, consider the following input:
```
5
101 0
10 1
110 0
1 1
111 0
```

The expected output would be:
```
4
move 10 1
move 101 5
move 111 4
move 110 3
```

However, the current implementation will produce:
```
4
move 1 1
move 10 2
move 101 5
move 111 4
```

This is incorrect because the file named `10` should be moved to `2`, not `1`. The program needs to ensure that all examples are moved first and then all regular tests are moved in their correct order. The current logic does not guarantee this.
