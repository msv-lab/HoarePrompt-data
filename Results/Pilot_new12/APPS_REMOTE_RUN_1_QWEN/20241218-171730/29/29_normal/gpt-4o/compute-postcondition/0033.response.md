`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` was either `2 * n` or the last value where `str(temp_counter)` was in `files_set` and `temp_counter` is no longer less than or equal to `2 * n - 1`, adding 1 to it means `temp_counter` is now one more than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`i`, `examples`, and `moves`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0; `examples[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`, where `temp_counter` is one more than its previous value (either `2 * n + 1` or the next value after the last value in `files_set`); `temp_counter` is one more than its previous value; `moves` is a list containing the string `'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `examples[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`, where `temp_counter` is one more than its previous value; `temp_counter` is one more than its previous value; `moves` is a list containing the string `'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`.**
