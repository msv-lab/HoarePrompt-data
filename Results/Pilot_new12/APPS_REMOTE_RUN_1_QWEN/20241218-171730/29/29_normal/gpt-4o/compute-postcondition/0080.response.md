`regulars[i]` is assigned the value `str(temp_counter)`. Since `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, the value of `regulars[i]` becomes `str(2 * n + 1)`. The values of `files_set` and `moves` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains all integers from 0 to `2 * n`, `regulars[i]` is `"2 * n + 1"`, and `moves` now contains a new element `'move regulars[i] temp_counter'`.**
