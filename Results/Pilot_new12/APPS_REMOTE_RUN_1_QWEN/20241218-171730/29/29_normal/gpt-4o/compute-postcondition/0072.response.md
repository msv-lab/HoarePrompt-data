Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the initial program state step by step:

### Given Information
- The loop condition is: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`
- Initial state before the loop:
  - `regulars` has at least one element.
  - `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`.
  - The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.

### Loop Condition Breakdown
1. **Condition 1**: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
2. **Condition 2**: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

For the loop to execute at least once, we need to satisfy both conditions:

1. **Condition 1**: 
   - We need `temp_counter` to be such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` starts from 0 initially, it will need to be incremented until it satisfies this condition. 

2. **Condition 2**: 
   - We need `str(temp_counter)` to be present in `files_set`. This means that there should be a file name in `files_set` that matches the string representation of `temp_counter`.

### Adjusting States
To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that:
- `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`.

Since the initial value of `temp_counter` is not specified, we can assume it starts from 0. Therefore, the smallest value for `temp_counter` to satisfy `temp_counter <= 2 * n` would be 0 (if `2 * n` is positive).

Given that `str(0)` should be in `files_set` to satisfy the second condition, we need to ensure `0` is in `files_set`.

### Final Program State Before the Loop
The state right before the loop should include:
- `temp_counter` must be 0.
- `0` must be in `files_set`.

### Conclusion
State: **`temp_counter` is 0, and `0` is in `files_set`**.
