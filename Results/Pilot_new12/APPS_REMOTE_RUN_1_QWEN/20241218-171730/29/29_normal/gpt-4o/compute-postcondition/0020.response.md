The code initializes an empty list named `moves`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, or `regulars`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `moves` list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file in the format "name_i type_i", `examples` is a list of names of files that contain example tests, `regulars` is a list of names of files that contain regular tests, `moves` is an empty list**
