`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n. Since `temp_counter` was previously less than or equal to 2 * n, after incrementing by 1, it will still be less than or equal to 2 * n. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, and `examples[i]` is either "1" or has been updated to "2", `temp_counter` is `temp_counter` + 1, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
