Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `regulars` has at least one element.
- `i` is \((\text{initial } i) + 2\).
- `target` is \(\text{len(examples)} + (\text{initial } i) + 3\).
- `temp_counter` is \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 1\) and still less than or equal to \(2 \times n\).
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

### While Loop Condition:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to \(2 \times n\) and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `temp_counter` is \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 1\) and it is still less than or equal to \(2 \times n\).
   - `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirement:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must still satisfy both conditions in the `while` loop.
   - Specifically, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to \(2 \times n\).
   - `str(temp_counter + 1)` must also be in `files_set`.

### Required Adjustments:
- Since `temp_counter` is already less than or equal to \(2 \times n\), no adjustment is needed for this part.
- However, we need to ensure that `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set` for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
- `regulars` has at least one element (unchanged).
- `i` is \((\text{initial } i) + 2\) (unchanged).
- `target` is \(\text{len(examples)} + (\text{initial } i) + 3\) (unchanged).
- `temp_counter` is updated to \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 1\) (unchanged but now \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 2\)).
- `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Answer:
State: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is \((\text{initial } i) + 2\), `target` is \(\text{len(examples)} + (\text{initial } i) + 3\), `temp_counter` is \((\text{previous } temp_counter) + 2\) and still less than or equal to \(2 \times n\), and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.**
