State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer representing the number of files, `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file and has the format "name_i type_i", with `name_i` being a filename and `type_i` being either "1" or "0" indicating if the file contains an example test or a regular test respectively; `examples` is an empty list; `regulars` is an empty list.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop variable is `file`, which iterates over each element in the `files` list.
   - The condition for the loop is that there must be at least one element in the `files` list for the loop to execute.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of files.
   - `files` is a list of strings, where each string is in the format "name_i type_i".
   - `examples` is an empty list.
   - `regulars` is an empty list.

3. **Required Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, the `files` list must contain at least one element. If `files` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - Since `n` is given as an integer representing the number of files, if `n` is 0, the `files` list will be empty, and thus the loop will not execute.

Therefore, we need to ensure that the `files` list has at least one element for the loop to execute. Additionally, since the loop body is omitted, no changes are needed for `examples` and `regulars` lists.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `files` must have at least one element**
