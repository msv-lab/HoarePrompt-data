`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` was `2 * n`. After the increment, `temp_counter` becomes `2 * n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is `(initial i) + 1`, `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, and `regulars[i]` is `str(2 * n)`; `moves` contains the string 'move regulars[(initial i) + 1] temp_counter'.**
