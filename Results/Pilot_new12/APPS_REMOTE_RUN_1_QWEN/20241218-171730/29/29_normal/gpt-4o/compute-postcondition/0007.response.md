`regulars.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the list `regulars`. Since `name` is part of the split string from `file`, and `type_` is not equal to '1', these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `n` and `files` are also unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `files` must have at least one element, `name` is part of the split string from `file`, `type_` is the other part of the split string from `file` and is not equal to '1', `regulars` is a list with an additional element `name`.**
