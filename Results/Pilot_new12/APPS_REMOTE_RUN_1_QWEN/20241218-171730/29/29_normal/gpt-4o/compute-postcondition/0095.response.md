`i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `(initial i) + 1`. `regulars[i]` is referenced and added to `moves`, and `temp_counter` remains unchanged. The value of `temp_counter` is `2 * n`, and its string representation exists in `files_set`. The states of `regulars`, `target`, and `temp_counter` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`regulars` has at least one element, `i` is `(initial i) + 1`, `target` is `len(examples) + (initial i) + 2`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n`, and `moves` contains the string 'move regulars[(initial i) + 1] temp_counter'.**
