`moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')` appends a string to the list `moves`. The string is formatted to include `examples[i]` and `temp_counter`. Given that `examples[i]` is either "1" or has been updated to "2", and `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, the value of `temp_counter` is still `2 * n + 1` since no operation changes its value. The `examples[i]` value is included in the string and appended to `moves`.

The output state is: `i` is 1, `examples[i]` is either "1" or "2", `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the string `'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `examples[i]` is either "1" or "2", `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the string `'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}'**.
