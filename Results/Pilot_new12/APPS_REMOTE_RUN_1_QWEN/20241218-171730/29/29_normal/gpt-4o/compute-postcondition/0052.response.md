Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `examples[i]` is "2", `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`. If `examples[i]` is not equal to "2", `examples[i]` is set to "2".***
