The `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. This means that the new value of `temp_counter` is the previous value of `temp_counter` plus 1. The loop condition will now be checked with the updated `temp_counter` value. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 1
- `examples[i]` is either "1" or has been updated to "2"
- `temp_counter` must be `temp_counter + 1`
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`

After executing `temp_counter += 1`, the updated state is:
- `i` is still 1
- `examples[i]` is still either "1" or has been updated to "2"
- `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`
- `str(temp_counter)` must still be in `files_set`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `examples[i]` is either "1" or has been updated to "2", `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
