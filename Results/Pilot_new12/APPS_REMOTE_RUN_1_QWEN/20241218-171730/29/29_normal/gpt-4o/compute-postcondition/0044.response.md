`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is 2, so it becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `examples[i]` is either "1" or has been updated to "2", `temp_counter` is 3, `2` must be in `files_set`, and `n` must be at least 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `examples[i]` is either "1" or has been updated to "2", `temp_counter` is 3, `2` must be in `files_set`, and `n` must be at least 1**
