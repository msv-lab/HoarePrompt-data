Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- `regulars` has at least one element.
- `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`.
- The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.

### Loop Code
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    temp_counter += 1
```

### Observations from First Few Iterations
- After 1 iteration: `temp_counter` is 1, and `0` is in `files_set`.
- After 2 iterations: `temp_counter` is 2, `0` is in `files_set`, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `"2"` must be added to `files_set` in the loop body.
- After 3 iterations: `temp_counter` is 3, `0` is in `files_set`, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `"2"` must be added to `files_set` in the loop body.

From these observations, we can deduce the following:
- `temp_counter` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time the condition is met.
- The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

### Final State Analysis
- Since the loop continues until `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n`, the final value of `temp_counter` will be `2 * n + 1`.
- All values from 1 to `2 * n` will be added to `files_set` during the loop.
- Therefore, `files_set` will contain all integers from 0 to `2 * n`.

### Output State
Given that the loop will continue until `temp_counter` reaches `2 * n + 1`, and all integers from 1 to `2 * n` will be added to `files_set`, we can conclude the final state as follows:

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `files_set` contains all integers from 0 to `2 * n`**
