Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. **Current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `examples[i]` is "2"
   - `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`
   - `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`

3. **Determine the necessary conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - We know `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, so this condition is already met.
   - We need to ensure that `temp_counter` is such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.

5. **Determine the required adjustment**:
   - Since `str(temp_counter)` is already in `files_set`, we only need to adjust `temp_counter` to be within the range `0 <= temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
   - Given that `temp_counter` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the next valid `temp_counter` should be within the range defined by `2 * n`.

6. **Final state before the next iteration**:
   - We need to ensure that `temp_counter` is set to a value that satisfies `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.

Given that `n` must be at least 1, let's assume `n = 1` (the minimum value). Then `2 * n = 2`. Therefore, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2.

Since `temp_counter` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the next valid `temp_counter` would be 1 or 2 (assuming it was initially 0 or 1).

Thus, the state before the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `examples[i]` is "2", `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`**
