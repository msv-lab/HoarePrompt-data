The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `i` is 2 and `examples[i]` is "2", this part of the condition remains true. The precondition that `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set` is still valid. The value of `n` must be at least 1, which remains unchanged. The list `moves` is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`. All other variables remain in their original state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `examples[i]` is "2", `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, `n` must be at least 1, and `moves` is a list containing the strings `'move 2 {temp_counter}'` and `'move 2 2'`**
