You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The All-Berland National Olympiad in Informatics has just ended! Now Vladimir wants to upload the contest from the Olympiad as a gym to a popular Codehorses website.

Unfortunately, the archive with Olympiad's data is a mess. For example, the files with tests are named arbitrary without any logic.

Vladimir wants to rename the files with tests so that their names are distinct integers starting from 1 without any gaps, namely, "1", "2", ..., "n', where n is the total number of tests.

Some of the files contain tests from statements (examples), while others contain regular tests. It is possible that there are no examples, and it is possible that all tests are examples. Vladimir wants to rename the files so that the examples are the first several tests, all all the next files contain regular tests only.

The only operation Vladimir can perform is the "move" command. Vladimir wants to write a script file, each of the lines in which is "move file_1 file_2", that means that the file "file_1" is to be renamed to "file_2". If there is a file "file_2" at the moment of this line being run, then this file is to be rewritten. After the line "move file_1 file_2" the file "file_1" doesn't exist, but there is a file "file_2" with content equal to the content of "file_1" before the "move" command.

Help Vladimir to write the script file with the minimum possible number of lines so that after this script is run:  all examples are the first several tests having filenames "1", "2", ..., "e", where e is the total number of examples;  all other files contain regular tests with filenames "e + 1", "e + 2", ..., "n", where n is the total number of all tests. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of files with tests.

n lines follow, each describing a file with test. Each line has a form of "name_i type_i", where "name_i" is the filename, and "type_i" equals "1", if the i-th file contains an example test, and "0" if it contains a regular test. Filenames of each file are strings of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters. The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.


-----Output-----

In the first line print the minimum number of lines in Vladimir's script file.

After that print the script file, each line should be "move file_1 file_2", where "file_1" is an existing at the moment of this line being run filename, and "file_2" — is a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6.

        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
    return moves


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where multiple example files already have sequential names starting from 1. In such cases, the program should not attempt to rename these files since they already meet the requirement of being named "1", "2", ..., "e".

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
1 0
2 1
3 1
4 0
5 0
```

Expected output:
```
3
move 4 1
move 5 2
move 1 3
```

However, the provided program will attempt to rename the files "2" and "3" despite them already being correctly named. This results in the wrong output:
```
4
move 1 5
move 2extra 4
move 3 1
move 2 2
```

Here, "2extra" is renamed unnecessarily, and "3" is moved to "1" instead of remaining unchanged. Thus, the program does not always rename files correctly according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = data[1:n + 1]

moves = func_1(n, files)
print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of files, and files is a list of strings, where each string represents a file and has the format "name_i type_i", with name_i being a filename and type_i being either "1" or "0" indicating if the file contains an example test or a regular test respectively.

        else:
            regulars.append(name)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file in the format "name_i type_i", `examples` is a list of names of files that contain example tests, and `regulars` is a list of names of files that contain regular tests.

    for i in range(len(examples)):
        if examples[i] != str(i + 1):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `examples` is a list of strings where `examples[i]` is equal to `str(i + 1)` for all valid indices.
    #- `temp_counter` is equal to `2 * n + 1` (or the highest index used during the loop).
    #- `files_set` contains the names of all files that are present in the `files` list.
    #- `moves` is a list of strings indicating all the move commands required to place each file in its correct position.
    #
    #Output State:
    for i in range(len(regulars)):
        target = len(examples) + i + 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
                temp_counter += 1
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
            regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
            temp_counter += 1
        
        if regulars[i] != str(target):
            moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {target}')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `regulars` is a list of strings where each element is either in its correct position (i.e., equal to `str(len(examples) + i + 1)` for some `i` in the range of the list length) or has been moved to its correct position, `target` is the correct position for the last unplaced element in `regulars`, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1` if no elements were moved, otherwise it is the next available position after placing the last element, `files_set` contains all integers from 0 to `2 * n`, and `moves` is a list of all the move commands required to place each file in its correct position.
    return moves
    #The program returns the list of all the move commands required to place each file in its correct position, stored in the variable `moves`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `files`, where each element in `files` is a string representing a file with the format "name_i type_i". It returns a list of move commands required to place each file in its correct position. Specifically, files with type "1" (example tests) are placed in positions 1 through `n`, and files with type "0" (regular tests) are placed in positions `n+1` through `2*n`. The function ensures that each file's name matches its position index after reordering, using temporary move commands to achieve this. If a file's name does not match its intended position, the function uses the smallest available index to temporarily place the file and then moves it to its correct position. Potential edge cases include when a file's name is already in the correct position, or when no such position exists, requiring the use of a temporary index. The function handles these cases by ensuring every file ends up in its correct position with the minimum number of move commands.
