`color_count[color]` is incremented by 1. The value of `color` is a substring of `s`. The value of `color_count` before this operation depends on whether `color` was already a key in `color_count`. If it was, its value is increased by 1; if not, it is set to 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `s`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string input from the user, and `color_count` is a dictionary where the key is `color` and the value is either `color_count[color] + 1` if `color` is already in `color_count`, or 1 if `color` is not in `color_count`. Additionally, `color_count[color]` is incremented by 1.**
