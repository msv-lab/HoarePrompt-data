Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters \( n \) and \( k \), both of which are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq n, k \leq 100 \), and a string \( s \) consisting of lowercase letters. It counts the frequency of each color (character) in the string \( s \). Then, it checks if the frequency of any color exceeds \( k \). If no color frequency exceeds \( k \), it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to distribute the balloons according to the given conditions. Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to do so. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values for \( n \) and \( k \) or characters other than lowercase letters in \( s \)), which are handled by the input processing part of the code. However, the function does not explicitly handle these edge cases in its logic; it assumes valid inputs.**
