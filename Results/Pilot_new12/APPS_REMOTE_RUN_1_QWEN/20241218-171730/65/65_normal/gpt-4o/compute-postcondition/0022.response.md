The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code, the only effect is that we break out of the hypothetical loop or conditional block we were inside. The values of `count` and `can_distribute` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is an integer greater than `k`; `can_distribute` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
