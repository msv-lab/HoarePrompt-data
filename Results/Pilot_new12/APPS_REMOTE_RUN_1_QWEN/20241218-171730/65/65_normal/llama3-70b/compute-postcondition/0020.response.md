The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters (possibly empty), `color_count` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in the string `s`, `max_color_count` is the maximum value among the counts of characters in `s`, and the print statement outputs 'YES'**.
