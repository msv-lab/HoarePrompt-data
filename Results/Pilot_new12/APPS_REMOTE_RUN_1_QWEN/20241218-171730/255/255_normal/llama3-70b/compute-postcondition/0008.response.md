`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is either 1 or 2. If `s[2]` is not equal to `s[1]`, then `ans` is 2. Therefore, after executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` will be 2 (since adding 1 to 1 results in 2, and it cannot be 1 because it would not satisfy the condition of being incremented). The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is 2**
