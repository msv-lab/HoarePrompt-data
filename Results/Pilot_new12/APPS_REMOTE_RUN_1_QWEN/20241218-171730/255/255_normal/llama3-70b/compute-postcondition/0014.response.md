The code `print(ans)` does not modify any variables. It simply prints the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is the count of transitions between consecutive characters in the string `s`. Since the code does not change `ans`, `s`, or `n`, these variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input value where \(1 \leq n \leq 500\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is the count of transitions between consecutive characters in the string `s`, and `ans` is printed.**
