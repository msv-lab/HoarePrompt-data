Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer input value where \(1 \leq n \leq 500\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `ans` is initialized to 1.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
        ans += 1
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the string `s` from index 1 to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, if the current character `s[i]` is different from the previous character `s[i-1]`, the `ans` variable is incremented by 1.

### Understanding the Loop:
- The loop will execute `n-1` times since it starts from `i = 1` and ends at `i = n-1`.
- Each iteration checks if `s[i]` is different from `s[i-1]`.

### Final Values:
- After the loop finishes, `ans` will be the count of positions where consecutive characters in the string `s` are different.
- Specifically, `ans` will be the number of transitions (or changes) between consecutive characters in the string `s`.

### Conclusion:
- If the string `s` has no transitions (all characters are the same), `ans` will remain 1.
- If there are transitions, `ans` will be incremented for each transition.

### Output State:
The final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations is:
- `n` is the integer input value where \(1 \leq n \leq 500\).
- `s` is the string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `ans` is the count of transitions (changes) between consecutive characters in the string `s`.

Thus, the output state is:
**Output State: **`n` is an integer input value where \(1 \leq n \leq 500\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is the count of transitions between consecutive characters in the string `s`.**
