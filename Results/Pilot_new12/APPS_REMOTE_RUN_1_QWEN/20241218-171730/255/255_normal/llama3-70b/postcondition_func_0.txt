The function `func()` accepts an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 500\)) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then counts the number of transitions (changes) between consecutive characters in the string `s`. A transition is defined as a change in character from one position to the next. If the string starts with a transition (i.e., the first and second characters are different), it is counted as well. The function prints the total count of these transitions.
