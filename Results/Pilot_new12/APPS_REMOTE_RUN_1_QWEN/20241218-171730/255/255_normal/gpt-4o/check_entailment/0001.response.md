Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not account for the scenario where multiple contiguous substrings of the same character appear in the string. For example, consider the input `aabbaa`. The program will output `3` because it increments the operation count for each different character, but the optimal solution is to delete `aa` and then `bb`, resulting in only `2` operations.

Here is an example where the program fails:
- Input: `aabbaa`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `3`

Thus, the program is incorrect.
