The code `print(operations)` simply prints the value of `operations`. The value of `operations` remains unchanged after this print statement. The other variables (`s` and `n`) are not affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`s` is a string entered by the user, `n` is the original input integer, `operations` is the count of character transitions in `s` where each character at index `i` (for `i` in range 1 to `n-1`) is different from the previous character `s[i-1]`. The value of `operations` is printed.**
