Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to consider pairs where \(a \neq b\) and both are within the given range \([l, r]\). The code only checks if \(a\) and \(b\) are within the range and meet the GCD and LCM conditions, but it does not ensure that \(a \neq b\) when counting the pairs. This leads to an incorrect count of good pairs.

For example, consider the input \(l = 50\), \(r = 100\), \(x = 3\), and \(y = 30\). According to the problem description, the pairs \((3, 30)\) and \((30, 3)\) should be counted, but the current implementation does not count these pairs separately because it checks for equality before counting.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that \(a \neq b\) when counting the pairs. Here is a modified version of the code that should work correctly:

```python
import math

def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if y % x != 0:
        return 0
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y):
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
    return count

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))
```

This modified code ensures that all good pairs are counted correctly, including cases where \(a \neq b\). Therefore, the original code is incorrect.
