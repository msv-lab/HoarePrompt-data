Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of good pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y within the given range [l, r]. Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input and passes it to the `func_1` function.
2. **GCD and LCM Relationship**: It checks if `y % x == 0`, which is necessary for valid pairs (a, b).
3. **Range Validation**: For each factor `i` of `z = y // x`, it calculates `a` and `b` and checks if they lie within the specified range `[l, r]`.
4. **Pair Counting**: It counts both (a, b) and (b, a) as distinct pairs if `a != b`.

Given the provided test cases:
- **Example 1**: (1, 2, 1, 2) -> Output: 2 (Correct)
- **Example 2**: (1, 12, 1, 12) -> Output: 4 (Correct)
- **Example 3**: (50, 100, 3, 30) -> Output: 0 (Correct)

And considering the logic, there are no apparent edge cases or potential scenarios where the program might fail. Therefore, the program appears to handle all described cases correctly.
