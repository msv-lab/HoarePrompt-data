Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\); `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`; `z` is an integer equal to `y // x`; if `a == b`, then `count` is either 2 or `count + 3`, `i` is \(k + 1\); `a` is \((k + 1) * x\); `b` is \(\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) // (k + 1) * x\). Otherwise, `count` is 3, `i` is \(k + 1\); `a` is \((k + 1) * x\); `b` is \(\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) // (k + 1) * x\).***
