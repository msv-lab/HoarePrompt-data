Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\); `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`; `z` is an integer equal to `y // x`; `count` is either 3, `count + 2`, or `count + 3` depending on the conditions specified; `i` is \(k + 1\); `a` is \((k + 1) * x\); `b` is \(\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) // (k + 1) * x\).***

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the program variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts. It captures the conditions under which `count` is incremented and the values of other variables remain unchanged as per the provided logic.
