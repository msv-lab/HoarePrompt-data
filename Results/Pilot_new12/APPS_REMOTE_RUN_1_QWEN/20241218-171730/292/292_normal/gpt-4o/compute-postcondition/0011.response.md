The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. Given that `a` is either 9 or 18, the new value of `a` will be 27 or 54, respectively. The value of `b` remains unchanged because it was not affected by the code, and `years` has already been incremented by 1 and is thus 2.

Output State: **`a` is 27 or 54; `b` must be greater than or equal to 18; `years` is 2**
