The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The parameters `a` and `b` are not part of the function definition but rather seem to be implied from the context. Given the constraints, the function should work within the range where `1 <= a <= b <= 10`.

However, since the function definition itself does not include any parameters (`def func():`), and the outputs provided do not directly reference these parameters, we can infer that the function might be returning some value based on the given constraints.

Given the constraints and the need to match the format:

The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but works within the range where `1 <= a <= b <= 10`. The function may return different values based on the relationship between `a` and `b`, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but works within the range where `1 <= a <= b <= 10`, and returns a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`.**
