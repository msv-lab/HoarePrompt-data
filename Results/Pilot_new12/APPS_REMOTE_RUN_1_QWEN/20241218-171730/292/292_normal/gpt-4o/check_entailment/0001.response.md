Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It simulates the growth of Limak and Bob's weights over time, tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight each year, until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The program increments a counter (`years`) to keep track of the number of years it takes for this condition to be met. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program will always find a solution within a reasonable number of iterations. All provided examples and potential cases within the given constraints work as expected, making the program correct.
