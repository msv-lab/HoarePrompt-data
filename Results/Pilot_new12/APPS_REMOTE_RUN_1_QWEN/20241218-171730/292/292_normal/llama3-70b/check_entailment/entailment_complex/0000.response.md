Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, which are guaranteed to be within the range \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). This matches the problem description.

2. **Loop Logic**: The program uses a while loop to incrementally increase `a` and `b` until `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`. Specifically:
   - `a` is tripled in each iteration (`a *= 3`).
   - `b` is doubled in each iteration (`b *= 2`).
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

3. **Counting Years**: The variable `years` is incremented in each iteration of the loop, counting the number of years it takes for `a` to become greater than `b`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the value of `years` once `a` exceeds `b`.

5. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates as soon as `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`, ensuring that the final output is the smallest number of years after which `a` will be greater than `b`.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles all valid inputs and ensures that `a` is tripled while `b` is doubled, counting the number of years until `a` becomes strictly greater than `b`. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
