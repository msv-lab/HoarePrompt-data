Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. Let's verify this by considering the examples given:

1. For input `4 7`:
   - After 1 year: Limak = 4 * 3 = 12, Bob = 7 * 2 = 14 (Limak is not larger)
   - After 2 years: Limak = 12 * 3 = 36, Bob = 14 * 2 = 28 (Limak is larger)
   - Output: 2

2. For input `4 9`:
   - After 1 year: Limak = 4 * 3 = 12, Bob = 9 * 2 = 18 (Limak is not larger)
   - After 2 years: Limak = 12 * 3 = 36, Bob = 18 * 2 = 36 (Limak is not larger)
   - After 3 years: Limak = 36 * 3 = 108, Bob = 36 * 2 = 72 (Limak is larger)
   - Output: 3

3. For input `1 1`:
   - After 1 year: Limak = 1 * 3 = 3, Bob = 1 * 2 = 2 (Limak is larger)
   - Output: 1

The program logic is correct as it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight in each iteration until Limak's weight becomes strictly larger than Bob's. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program will always terminate within a reasonable number of iterations, ensuring correctness for all valid inputs.
