`a` is multiplied by 3, so the new value of `a` will be `3 * a`. The original condition that `a` must be less than or equal to the current value of `b` in the next iteration still holds true. The value of `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is less than or equal to 6 \* 3, `b` is either 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20, and `a` must be less than or equal to the current value of `b` in the next iteration**
