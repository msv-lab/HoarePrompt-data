The code initializes the variable `years` to 0. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), and 1 <= `a` <= `b` <= 10; `years` is 0**
