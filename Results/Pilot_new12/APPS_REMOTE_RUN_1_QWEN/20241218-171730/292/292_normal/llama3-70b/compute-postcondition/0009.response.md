The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `years` is 1, so after executing `years += 1`, the value of `years` becomes 2. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.

Output State: **`a` is less than or equal to 6; `b` is either 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20; `years` is 2**
