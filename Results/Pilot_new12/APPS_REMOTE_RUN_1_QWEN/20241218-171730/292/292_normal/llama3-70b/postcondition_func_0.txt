The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). It then enters a loop where `a` is tripled and `b` is doubled in each iteration until `a` exceeds `b`. The function counts the number of iterations performed and prints the result. After the function concludes, `a` is greater than `b`, `years` contains the number of iterations performed, and `b` is at most 80 (since the maximum value for `b` starts at 10 and doubles up to five times).
