The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters (only vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' are allowed) with a length not exceeding 100. The function iterates through the string `s` to find the maximum gap (number of consonants) between any two consecutive vowels. It updates the variable `max_jump` to store this maximum gap. After the iteration, it ensures that `max_jump` is also updated to include the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. The function then returns `max_jump`. Potential edge cases include strings with no vowels or with only one vowel. In such cases, `max_jump` would be the length of the string.
