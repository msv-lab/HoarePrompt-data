Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100.
   - `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s`.
   - `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`.
   - `prev_pos` is now equal to `i`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(s) - 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - We know that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an index within the string `s`.
   - `max_jump` has been updated to include the maximum value of `i - prev_pos`.
   - `prev_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `i`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(s)`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since `i` is increased by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `max_jump` remains the same as it was updated during the previous iteration and will only be updated if `i + 1` is a valid index (i.e., `i + 1 < len(s)`).
   - `prev_pos` remains the same as it was set to the previous value of `i` in the previous iteration.

Given this reasoning, we can conclude the following state for the next iteration:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100; `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 1`; `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`; `prev_pos` is now equal to `i`**.
