The code updates the variable `max_jump` to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`. Here, `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s`, and `prev_pos` is updated to `i + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 2`.
- `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`.
- `prev_pos` is now equal to `i + 1`.

After executing the line `max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)`:
- `max_jump` will be the maximum of its original value and `i - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `-1`.
- `prev_pos` is updated to `i + 1`.

Since `i` is `i + 2`, the subtraction `i - (i + 1)` is `-1`, and the maximum value between `max_jump` (which is originally undefined but will take the minimum initial value when compared with `-1`) and `-1` will be `-1`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 2`, `max_jump` is `-1`, and `prev_pos` is `i + 1`.**
