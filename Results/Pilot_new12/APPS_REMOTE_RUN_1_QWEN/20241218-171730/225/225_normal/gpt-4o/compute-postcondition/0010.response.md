`prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 1`. The values of `s` and `max_jump` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 1`, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`, `prev_pos` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 1`, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`, `prev_pos` is now equal to `i`**
