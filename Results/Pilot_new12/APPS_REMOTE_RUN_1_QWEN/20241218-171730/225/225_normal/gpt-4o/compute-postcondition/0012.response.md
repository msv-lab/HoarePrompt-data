According to the code, the loop iterates over each index of the string `s`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters.
- `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 1`.
- `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`.
- `prev_pos` is now equal to `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `s`. Since `i` is currently `i + 1`, the new value of `i` for the next iteration will be `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.

Therefore, the new state should reflect that `i` is incremented by 1, and `max_jump` and `prev_pos` retain their values from the last iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is the index of either a vowel or a non-vowel character in `s` and is `i + 2`, `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and `i - prev_pos`, and `prev_pos` is now equal to `i + 1`.**
