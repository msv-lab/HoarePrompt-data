Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100.
   - `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel.
   - `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel encountered (set to `i` if this is the first vowel).
   - `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `((i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)` if `last_vowel` was not -1. If `s[i]` is not a vowel, the values of `last_vowel` and `max_jump` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `vowels` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `last_vowel` is updated only if `s[i]` is a vowel and `last_vowel` was previously set to -1 or a different value.
   - `max_jump` is updated only if `s[i]` is a vowel and `last_vowel` is not -1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `vowels` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `last_vowel` remains unchanged unless `s[i+1]` is a vowel and `last_vowel` was -1 or a different value.
   - `max_jump` remains unchanged unless `s[i+1]` is a vowel and `last_vowel` is not -1.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `last_vowel` and `max_jump` remain unchanged if they were not updated in the last iteration.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y', with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is such that `s[i]` is a vowel and `i` is `i + 1`, `last_vowel` remains unchanged, and `max_jump` remains unchanged.**
