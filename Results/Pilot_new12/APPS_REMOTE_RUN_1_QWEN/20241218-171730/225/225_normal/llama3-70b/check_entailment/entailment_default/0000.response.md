Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels. According to the problem description, the Grasshopper needs to be able to jump to the next vowel, and the maximum jump length should be determined based on the longest gap between consecutive vowels. However, the current implementation incorrectly halves the distance and adds 1, which does not accurately reflect the requirement.

For example, consider the input string "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT". The correct output should be 4 because the longest gap between vowels is from 'C' to 'F', which is 4 characters. However, the code calculates `(4 - 1) // 2 + 1 = 2`, which is incorrect.

Another example is the input "AAA". The correct output should be 1 because the distance between the first and last 'A' is 2, and the minimum jump ability needed is 2 // 2 + 1 = 1. But the code incorrectly returns 1 without considering the gap between the first and last 'A'.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
