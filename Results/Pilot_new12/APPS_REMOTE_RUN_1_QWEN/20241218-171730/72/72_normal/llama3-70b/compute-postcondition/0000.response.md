`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The previous values of these variables are no longer directly known, but their new values are the integers obtained from the input. The other conditions (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m) remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `y` is an integer between 1 and `m`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are the integers obtained from the input.**
