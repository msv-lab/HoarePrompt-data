The code calculates `max_asked` using the formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. This formula divides `k + (n - 1)` by `2 * n` and returns the floor division result. Since `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are the only variables mentioned and `max_asked` is the only new variable being defined, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Let's break down the calculation:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

The expression `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)` will produce an integer result depending on the specific values of `n` and `k`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we can represent the result of this operation in a general form. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 100`, then:

- `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) = (100 + (5 - 1)) // (2 * 5) = 104 // 10 = 10`.

However, without specific values, we express `max_asked` as the result of the given formula.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `y` is an integer between 1 and `m`, and `max_asked` is \((k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)\).**
