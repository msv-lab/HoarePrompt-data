Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total number of questions `k` is less than the number of pupils in the classroom (`n * m`). In such cases, the teacher will not complete a full cycle of asking all pupils. The current implementation assumes that the teacher can ask all pupils multiple times, which leads to incorrect results for smaller values of `k`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1 3 2 1 1
```
According to the problem description, the teacher will ask the first pupil in the first row twice. However, the current implementation calculates the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's count based on a full cycle, leading to incorrect results. The expected output should be:
```
2 2 2
```
But the program will output:
```
1 1 1
```
This discrepancy shows that the program does not handle the scenario where `k` is less than the total number of pupils correctly.
