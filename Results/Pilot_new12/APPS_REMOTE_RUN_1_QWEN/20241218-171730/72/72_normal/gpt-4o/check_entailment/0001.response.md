Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario when the number of remaining questions after completing full cycles is zero. Specifically, in the loop that processes the remaining questions, the program incorrectly increments `max_questions` for every question, regardless of whether the current position corresponds to the row and seat of Sergei. This leads to an overestimation of the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1 3 8 1 1
```
The expected output is:
```
3 2 3
```
However, the program outputs:
```
3 2 3
```
This is correct for this specific case. However, consider another input:
```
1 3 7 1 1
```
The expected output is:
```
2 2 2
```
But the program incorrectly outputs:
```
3 2 2
```
This is because the program increments `max_questions` for every question, even though there are not enough questions left to reach the end of a full cycle. This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the remaining questions when they are fewer than a full cycle length.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
