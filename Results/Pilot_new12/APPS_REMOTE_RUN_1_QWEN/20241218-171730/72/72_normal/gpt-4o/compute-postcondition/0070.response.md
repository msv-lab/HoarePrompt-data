According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `col` and `m`. The loop will iterate as long as `col` is less than `m`. Before the loop starts, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `col` starts from 0 (the initial value) and `m` is greater than 0.

Here is the state after adjustment:

State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
