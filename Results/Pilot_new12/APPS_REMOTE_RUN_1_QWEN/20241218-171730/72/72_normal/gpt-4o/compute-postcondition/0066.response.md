Postcondition: ***`sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 (initially incremented by 1 + 2 from if part), `max_questions` is decreased by 1 (initially decreased by 1 - 1 from if part), `col` is incremented by 1 (initially incremented by 1 + 2 from if part), and `row` is incremented by 2 if the condition `row == -1` is true. Otherwise, the values of `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, `col`, and `row` remain as they were after the initial increments/decrements.***
