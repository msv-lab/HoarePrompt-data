The code sets the value of `direction` to `-1`. This does not affect the values of `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, `col`, or `row`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `row` is incremented by `direction`, `direction` is -1**
