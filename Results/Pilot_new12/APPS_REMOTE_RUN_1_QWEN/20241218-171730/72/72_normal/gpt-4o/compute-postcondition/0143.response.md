The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of `col`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, and `row` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`col` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is increased by the value of `direction`, `direction` is -1**
