`row` is decremented by 2. Since `row` was previously the previous value of `row` plus `direction`, and `direction` is `-1`, let's denote the previous value of `row` as `prev_row`. So, the previous value of `row` was `prev_row - 1`. Now, `row` becomes `prev_row - 1 - 2 = prev_row - 3`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is `prev_row - 3`, `col` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `m`, `x` remains unchanged, and `direction` is `-1`.**
