To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider what the loop's condition depends on and ensure those conditions are met.

The loop iterates based on the variable `remaining_questions`, which is defined as follows:
\[ remaining\_questions = max\_questions - full\_cycles \]

Given the definitions:
\[ full\_cycles = \left( k // (2 * n - 2) \right) * m \]
\[ max\_questions = \left( (k // (2 * n - 2)) * m + n - 1 \right) // (2 * n - 2) \]

We need to ensure that `remaining_questions` is a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`full_cycles`**: This value is derived from `k`, `n`, and `m`. To ensure the loop executes, `full_cycles` must be a non-negative integer.

2. **`max_questions`**: This value is derived from `k`, `n`, and `m`. We need to ensure that `max_questions` is a positive integer.

3. **`remaining_questions`**: The number of questions remaining to be answered. For the loop to execute, `remaining_questions` must be a positive integer.

4. **Initial values of loop variables**: `row` and `direction` need to be set appropriately for the loop to proceed. Since the loop's body is omitted, we assume that these initial values are sufficient unless they affect the loop condition directly.

Now let's summarize the required states:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `k` is an integer between \(10^{18}\).
- `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`.
- `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`.
- `full_cycles` is \(\left( k // (2 * n - 2) \right) * m\), and this value must be a non-negative integer.
- `max_questions` is \(\left( (k // (2 * n - 2)) * m + n - 1 \right) // (2 * n - 2)\), and this value must be a positive integer.
- `remaining_questions` is \(max\_questions - full\_cycles\) and must be a positive integer.
- `row` is 0.
- `direction` is 1.

Thus, the required state to ensure the loop executes is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between \(10^{18}\), `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `m-1`, `full_cycles` is \(\left( k // (2 * n - 2) \right) * m\) and must be a non-negative integer, `max_questions` is \(\left( (k // (2 * n - 2)) * m + n - 1 \right) // (2 * n - 2)\) and must be a positive integer, `remaining_questions` is \(max\_questions - full\_cycles\) and must be a positive integer, `row` is 0, `direction` is 1.**
