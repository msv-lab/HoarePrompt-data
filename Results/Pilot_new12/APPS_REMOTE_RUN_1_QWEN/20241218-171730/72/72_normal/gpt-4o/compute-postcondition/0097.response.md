`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`remaining_questions`, `col`, `m`, `row`, `x`, `y`, `sergei_questions`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, `row` is equal to `x`, `col` is equal to `y` implies `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, otherwise the value of `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
