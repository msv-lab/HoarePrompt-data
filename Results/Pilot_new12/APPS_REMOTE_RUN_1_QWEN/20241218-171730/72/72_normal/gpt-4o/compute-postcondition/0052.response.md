Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is the previous value of `row` plus 1 (unless `row == -1`, in which case it becomes the previous value of `row` plus 1 plus 2), `col` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `m`, `x` remains unchanged, and `direction` remains unchanged or is now 1 if `row == -1`.***
