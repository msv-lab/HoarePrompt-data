Postcondition: ***`col` is 2, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, and `row` is 5.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we only consider the if part. The condition `row == -1` does not match the given state (`row` is `2 * direction + 1` which equals 5 when `direction` is 1), so the if part's postcondition directly applies, and there is no additional condition from the else part.
