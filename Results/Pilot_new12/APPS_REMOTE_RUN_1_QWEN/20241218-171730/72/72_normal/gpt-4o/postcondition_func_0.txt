The function `func()` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, which represent the dimensions of a grid and a number of questions, respectively. It calculates the minimum, maximum, and the exact number of times a specific cell `(x, y)` will be visited when traversing the grid according to certain rules.

After parsing the input, the function initializes several variables and calculates the number of full cycles and remaining questions based on the given parameters. It then determines the minimum and maximum number of visits to the cell `(x, y)` by considering the grid's dimensions and the traversal rules.

Next, the function iterates through the remaining questions and updates the count of visits to the cell `(x, y)` based on the current position within the grid. During each iteration, it also tracks the maximum number of visits encountered.

Finally, the function prints the maximum, minimum, and exact number of visits to the cell `(x, y)`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `x` is 0 or `n-1`, the logic for updating `sergei_questions` in the if-else block might need adjustment to ensure correct calculation.
2. The logic for updating `max_questions` in the for loop might have a missing increment/decrement depending on the direction.
3. The function assumes `m` is always greater than 0, but no explicit check is made for this condition.
4. The function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., `n`, `m` outside the range [1, 100] or `k` outside the range [1, \(10^{18}\)]), although the initial input validation ensures these constraints are met.
