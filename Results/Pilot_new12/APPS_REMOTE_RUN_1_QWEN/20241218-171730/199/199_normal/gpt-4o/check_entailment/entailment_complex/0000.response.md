Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes a positive integer `n` as input, which is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9). This meets the requirement.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - **Base Case**: If `n < 6`, the function returns 0. This handles the smallest possible value for `n` where forming four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square is not feasible.
   - **Loop Logic**: The function iterates over possible values of `a` from 1 to `n // 4`. This ensures that the remaining length after two parts (each of length `a`) is sufficient to form the other two parts (`b` and `c`).
   - **Conditions for Rectangle Formation**:
     - The total length of the stick is split into four parts: `a`, `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `a + a + b + c = n`.
     - To form a rectangle, `b` must equal `c` (since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal).
     - The condition `rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0` ensures that `rem` (the remaining length after accounting for the two `a`s) is positive and even. This is necessary because the remaining length needs to be split equally between `b` and `c` to form a rectangle.
     - The condition `a != rem // 2` ensures that the rectangle formed is not a square. If `a` equals `rem // 2`, it would imply that all four parts are equal, making it a square.

3. **Count Calculation**: The variable `count` is incremented each time a valid pair `(a, b)` is found that satisfies the above conditions.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the count of valid pairs, which matches the problem's requirement.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts to form a rectangle but not a square. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
