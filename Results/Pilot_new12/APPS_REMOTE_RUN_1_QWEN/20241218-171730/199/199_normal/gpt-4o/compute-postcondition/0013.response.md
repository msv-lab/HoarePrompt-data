`b` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` was previously \(n // 4 + 1\). Therefore, `b` is also \(n // 4 + 1\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is either 0 or 1, `rem` is \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\) with `rem` greater than 0 and even, `a` is \(n // 4 + 1\), `b` is \(n // 4 + 1\).**
