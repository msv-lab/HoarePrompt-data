Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\); `count` is either 2 or 3; `rem` is `n - 2`; `a` is 1; `b` is 0. If the condition `rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0` is true, `count` is determined based on the condition `a != rem // 2`: if the condition is true, `count` becomes 2 or 3, otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only considers the if part.***
