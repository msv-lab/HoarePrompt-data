The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\)) and returns the number of distinct pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a < b \leq \frac{n}{2}\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\). After the function execution, it also returns the last values of `a` and `b` that were checked in the loop. The function iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to find valid pairs, incrementing the `ways` counter each time a valid pair is found.
