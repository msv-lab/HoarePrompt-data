Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\)) and returns the number of distinct pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a < b \leq \frac{n}{2}\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\). After the function execution, it also returns the last values of `a` and `b` that were checked in the loop. The function iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to find valid pairs, incrementing the `ways` counter each time a valid pair is found.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If no valid pairs are found, `ways` remains 0, and the last values of `a` and `b` will be the highest values checked during the loop, which might be outside the expected range if no valid pairs exist.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation mentions returning the last values of `a` and `b`, but the code only returns `ways`. Therefore, the last values of `a` and `b` are not included in the return value.
