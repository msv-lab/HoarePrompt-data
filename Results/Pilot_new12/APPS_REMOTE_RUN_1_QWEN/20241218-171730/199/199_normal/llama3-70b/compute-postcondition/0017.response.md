Postcondition: ***`ways` is either 0 or a positive integer. If `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, then `ways` is incremented by 1. If the condition `a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n` is not met, `ways` remains unchanged. Given the precondition that `a` is 2 and `n` must be at least 4, `ways` will be adjusted accordingly based on the condition.***
