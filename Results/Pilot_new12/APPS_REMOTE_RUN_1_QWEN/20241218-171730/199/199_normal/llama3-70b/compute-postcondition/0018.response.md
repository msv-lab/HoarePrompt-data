To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. The initial conditions: `a` is 2, and `n` must be at least 4.
2. The condition for incrementing `ways`: `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `a` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `ways` is either 0 or a positive integer.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `b` values from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - For each `b`, the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` is checked.
   - If `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n` is true, `ways` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Range of `b`:**
   - Given `a = 2`, the range for `b` is from `2` to `(n - 2) // 2 + 1`.
   - Simplifying the range: `b` ranges from `2` to `(n - 2) // 2 + 1`.

4. **Check the Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `b` was the highest value in its range, which is `(n - 2) // 2 + 1`.
   - We need to check if this `b` satisfies the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` and `a != b`.

5. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - Since `a = 2`, the condition becomes `2 * (2 + b) == n` or `4 + 2b == n`.
   - Solving for `b`: `2b = n - 4` or `b = (n - 4) / 2`.

6. **Determine the Next `b` Value:**
   - If the current `b` value at the end of the previous iteration was `(n - 4) / 2`, the next `b` value would be `((n - 4) / 2) - 1`.

7. **Adjust the States:**
   - `ways` remains unchanged if the condition is not met or is already incremented.
   - `a` remains 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 4.
   - `b` will be the next value in the range, which is `((n - 4) / 2) - 1`.

### Final State:

- `ways` remains unchanged.
- `a` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `b` is `((n - 4) / 2) - 1`.

State: **`ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `b` is `((n - 4) / 2) - 1`**
