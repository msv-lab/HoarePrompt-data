According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `a` starting from 1 up to `n // 2 + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` needs to be incremented by 1 and must still be within the range defined by the loop condition. The loop will continue as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2 + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is 1.
- Therefore, `a` will be incremented to 2.

To determine if the loop should continue, we need to check if `a` (which is now 2) is still less than or equal to `n // 2 + 1`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^9\), `n // 2 + 1` will always be greater than 1, ensuring that `a` (2) is still within the valid range.

Thus, the loop will continue to execute.

State: **`ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\)**
