`ways` is incremented by 1, meaning it is now 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `ways` is 1, `a` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is not equal to 1, and twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`.

Output State: **`ways` is 1, `a` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is not equal to 1, and twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`.**
