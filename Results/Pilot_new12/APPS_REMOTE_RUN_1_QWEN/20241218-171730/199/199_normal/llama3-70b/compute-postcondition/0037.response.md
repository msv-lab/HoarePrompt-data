Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final output state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.

### Initial State
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
- `ways` is 0.

### Loop Analysis
The loop consists of two nested loops:
1. The outer loop runs over `a` from 1 to \(n // 2\).
2. The inner loop runs over `b` from `a` to \((n - a) // 2\).

The condition inside the inner loop checks whether:
\[ 2 \times (a + b) == n \]
and ensures that \(a \neq b\).

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ways` is initialized to 0.
   - `a` starts from 1 and goes up to \(n // 2\).
   - For each `a`, `b` starts from `a` and goes up to \((n - a) // 2\).

2. **Inner Loop Execution**:
   - For each combination of `a` and `b`, check if \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, increment `ways` by 1.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all possible combinations of `a` and `b` have been checked, `ways` will contain the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions.

### Conclusion
After all iterations of the loop, `ways` will hold the number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a < b \leq \frac{n}{2}\)
- \(2 \times (a + b) == n\)

If no such pairs exist, `ways` will remain 0.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`ways` is the number of pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ n//2 and 2 * (a + b) == n, `a` is the last value of `a` checked in the loop, `b` is the last value of `b` checked in the loop.**
