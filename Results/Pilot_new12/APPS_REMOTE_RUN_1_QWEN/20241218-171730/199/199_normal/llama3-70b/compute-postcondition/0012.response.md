Output State: **`ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 1, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initially, `ways` is 0, `a` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 2·10^9.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `a != b` and if `2 * (a + b) == n`.

3. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - If both conditions are satisfied, `ways` is incremented by 1.

4. **Final State Analysis:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there exists a valid `b` that satisfies the conditions `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`.
   - Since `a` is fixed at 1 throughout the loop, the condition simplifies to checking if there exists a `b` such that `2 * (1 + b) == n`, or equivalently, `2 + 2 * b == n` or `b == (n - 2) / 2`.

5. **Possible Values:**
   - If no such `b` exists, the loop will not execute, and `ways` remains 0.
   - If such a `b` exists, `ways` will be incremented for each valid pair `(a, b)`.

6. **Final Value of `ways`:**
   - `ways` will be the count of all valid pairs `(1, b)` that satisfy the equation `2 * (1 + b) == n` and `b` is within the range defined by the loop.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - After all iterations, `ways` will either be 0 if no valid `b` exists, or it will be a positive integer representing the number of valid pairs `(1, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
   - `a` remains 1 because it is fixed throughout the loop.
   - `n` remains within its initial constraints.

Thus, the final output state is that `ways` is either 0 or a positive integer, `a` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
