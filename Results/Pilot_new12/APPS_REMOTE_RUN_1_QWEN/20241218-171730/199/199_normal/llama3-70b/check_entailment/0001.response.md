Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where the lengths of the parts include values greater than half of the total length, which is necessary to ensure that the sum of two parts equals the sum of the other two parts, forming a rectangle but not a square.

For example, consider the input `20`. The correct output should be `4` as mentioned in the example. However, the current implementation might miss some valid combinations. For instance, `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}` are valid, but the program might not capture them correctly due to the constraints on `a` and `b`.

To fix this, the inner loop for `b` should iterate up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, ensuring all valid pairs are considered. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways
```

This ensures that all valid combinations are counted, including those with larger values of `b` that were previously missed.
