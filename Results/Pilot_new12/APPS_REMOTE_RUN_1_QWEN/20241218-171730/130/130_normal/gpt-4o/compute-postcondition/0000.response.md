The provided code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` does not actually perform any operations that would change the values of the variables $N$, $M$, $K$, and $L$. It simply reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`, which allows reading the entire input at once. However, this does not affect the values of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **$N$, $M$, $K$, and $L$ are integers such that $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$, $1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}$, and $M \cdot N \ge K + L$.**
