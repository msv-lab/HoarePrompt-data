Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when \(M \cdot x > N - K\) and \(L > M - 1\). Specifically, the formula used to calculate `min_x` does not ensure that the result will satisfy the condition that "Not less than \(L\) coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection."

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 2 1 2
```

According to the problem description:
- \(N = 2\) (total types of coins)
- \(M = 2\) (number of friends)
- \(K = 1\) (Ivan already has 1 coin)
- \(L = 2\) (at least 2 new coins are required)

Using the formula provided in the code:
\[ \text{min\_x} = \left\lfloor \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{2 + 2 - 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor = 1 \]

The code would then check if \(M \cdot \text{min\_x} \le N - K\):
\[ 2 \cdot 1 \le 2 - 1 \]
\[ 2 \le 1 \]

This condition fails, so the code prints \(-1\), which is incorrect because \(M \cdot x > N - K\) should not be the only criterion for printing \(-1\). Instead, we need to ensure that the total number of new coins (\(L\)) can be achieved with the given constraints.

A correct approach would involve checking if the total number of new coins required (\(L\)) can be distributed among the friends such that each friend gives at least one coin and no coin type is repeated. In the given example, since \(L = 2\) and there are only 2 types of coins, it is impossible for each friend to give a unique new coin, hence the output should be \(-1\).

The current implementation does not correctly handle this edge case, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.
