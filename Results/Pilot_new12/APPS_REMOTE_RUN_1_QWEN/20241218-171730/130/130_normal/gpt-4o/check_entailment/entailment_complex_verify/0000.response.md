Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to ensure that Ivan receives at least \(L\) new coins, while adhering to the constraints that each friend gifts the same number of coins and that all coins gifted must be different.

The annotated version provides clear insights into the state of the program at various points, confirming that the program correctly handles the inputs and performs the necessary calculations. Specifically:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from standard input, ensuring that they meet the specified constraints.
2. **Calculation of Minimum Coins**: The calculation of `min_x` using the formula \((L + M - 1) // M\) is correct, as it determines the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift.
3. **Feasibility Check**: The check `if (M * min_x <= N - K)` ensures that the total number of unique coins gifted is sufficient to meet the requirement of having at least \(L\) new coins. If this condition is satisfied, the program prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Given that the annotated version aligns with the problem description and the original assessment, there is no evidence to suggest that the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid, and the program is correct.
