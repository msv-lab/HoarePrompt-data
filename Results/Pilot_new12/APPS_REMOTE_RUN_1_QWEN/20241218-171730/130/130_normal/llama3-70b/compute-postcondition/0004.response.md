The code `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` and does not affect the values of the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. The conditions on these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer, `L` is an input integer, and they satisfy $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$ and $1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}$. Additionally, $M < N - K + 1$ or $M < L$; the value printed is `-1`.**
