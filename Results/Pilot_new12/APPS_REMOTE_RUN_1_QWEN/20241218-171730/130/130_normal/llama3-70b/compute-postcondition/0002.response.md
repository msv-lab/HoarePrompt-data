The code `print(1)` simply prints the number 1 to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The only change is that the console will output the number 1. However, since we are asked to provide the output state in terms of variable values, we will note that no variables have changed their values.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `M` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer, `L` is an input integer, and they satisfy $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$ and $1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}$. The condition `M >= N - K + 1` is true and the condition `M >= L` is true. The console prints 1.**
