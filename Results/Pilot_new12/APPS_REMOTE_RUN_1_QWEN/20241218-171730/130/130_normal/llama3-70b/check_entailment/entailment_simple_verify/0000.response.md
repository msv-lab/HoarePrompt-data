Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions.

- The program checks if the total number of friends (`M`) is sufficient to provide at least `N - K + 1` different coins (since Ivan already has `K` coins out of `N` possible ones).
- It also ensures that the total number of friends (`M`) is enough to provide at least `L` new coins.
- If both conditions are met, it prints `1` indicating that each friend can gift one coin.
- Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

The annotations clearly describe the state of the program and confirm that the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
