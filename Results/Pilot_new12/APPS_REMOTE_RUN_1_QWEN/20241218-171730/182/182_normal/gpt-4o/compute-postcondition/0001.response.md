The code snippet `normalized_angle = x % 360` takes the value of `x` (which is an integer representing the camera angle) and computes the remainder when `x` is divided by 360. This normalized angle will be between 0 and 359, inclusive, which represents the same rotation angle within a single full circle.

The initial state is:
- `x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.

After executing the code snippet, `normalized_angle` is assigned the value of `x % 360`. The value of `x` itself remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18; `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`.**
