Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical, but it fails to consider the modulo operation's behavior for negative angles.

For example, consider the input `-75` degrees:
- The camera is rotated 75 degrees clockwise, so the image is also rotated 75 degrees clockwise.
- The program calculates `normalized_angle = -75 % 360 = 285` (since `-75 + 360 = 285`).
- The number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed is `(360 - 285) // 90 % 4 = 75 // 90 % 4 = 0`.

However, the correct approach would be:
- For `-75` degrees, the closest 90-degree angle that minimizes the deviation is `-90` degrees (or `270` degrees clockwise), which requires 3 turns (since `-75 + 3*90 = 285 - 270 = 15` degrees deviation).

Therefore, the program does not provide the correct output for all possible inputs, particularly those involving negative angles.
