Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical. Here's why:

1. **Normalization**: The program normalizes the angle using `x % 360` to handle angles that are greater than 360 degrees or negative.
2. **Calculation of Turns**: It calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed by determining the difference between 360 degrees and the normalized angle, then dividing by 90 and taking modulo 4 to account for the periodicity of 360 degrees.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all possible angles within the specified range (-10^18 to 10^18) correctly. For any angle, the program will always output the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to align the image as closely as possible to the vertical.

Since the program correctly handles all tested scenarios and edge cases without any apparent flaws, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
