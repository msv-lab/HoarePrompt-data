Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation of the image from the vertical direction. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Normalization of Angle**: The code uses `normalized_angle = x % 360` to normalize the input angle to a value between 0 and 359 degrees. This ensures that the angle wraps around correctly if it exceeds 360 degrees or is negative.

2. **Calculating Turns**: The code calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed using `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. This formula determines how many 90-degree turns are required to get as close as possible to the vertical direction without exceeding it. The `% 4` ensures that the result is within the range of 0 to 3, which corresponds to the possible number of turns (0, 1, 2, or 3).

Given these steps, the code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For both positive and negative angles, the code provides the correct number of turns to minimize the deviation from the vertical direction. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
