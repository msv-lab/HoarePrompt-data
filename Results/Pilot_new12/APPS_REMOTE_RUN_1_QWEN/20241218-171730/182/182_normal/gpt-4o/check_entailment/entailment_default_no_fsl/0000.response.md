Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical. The calculation `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` does not always yield the correct result. For example, if the input angle is `-60`, the normalized angle is `300`, and the calculation results in `2` turns, which is incorrect. The correct number of turns should be `3` as explained in the problem description. This can be seen from the output hints and the examples provided. The code needs to account for the fact that a negative angle (counter-clockwise rotation) should be converted to a positive equivalent before performing the calculation.
