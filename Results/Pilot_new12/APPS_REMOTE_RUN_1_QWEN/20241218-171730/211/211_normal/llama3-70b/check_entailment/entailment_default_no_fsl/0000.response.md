Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the code only checks if there is a subarray whose sum is zero and prints "NO" if such a subarray exists. However, the problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero and the subarrays, when concatenated, form the original array. The code does not attempt to split the array into such subarrays. For example, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 -3
```

The correct output should be:
```
YES
2
1 2
3 3
```

However, the provided code will incorrectly print "NO" because the total sum of the array is zero. Therefore, the program does not handle the required logic to split the array into non-zero sum subarrays, leading to incorrect behavior for certain inputs.
