`k` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`; `k` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`; `k` is increased by 1**
