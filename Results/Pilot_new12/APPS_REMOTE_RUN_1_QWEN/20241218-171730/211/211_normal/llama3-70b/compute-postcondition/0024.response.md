`k` is incremented by 1, which means the new value of `k` is its previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `k` is increased by 1, `l` equals `r + 1`**
