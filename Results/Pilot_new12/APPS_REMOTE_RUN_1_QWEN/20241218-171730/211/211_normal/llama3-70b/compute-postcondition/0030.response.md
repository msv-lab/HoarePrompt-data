`l` is assigned the value of `r`. The value of `r` is unchanged, and the other variables (`n`, `prefix_sum`, `k`) remain in their original states since they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `k` is the previous value + 1 and equals to `k + 1`, and `l` is equal to `r`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to 0, `prefix_sum[r + 1]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, `k` is the previous value + 1 and equals to `k + 1`, and `l` is equal to `r`.**
