`prefix_sum[i + 1]` is assigned the value `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. The value of `prefix_sum[i + 2]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i + 1] + a[i + 1]`, which means it is no longer just `prefix_sum[i + 1] + a[i + 1]` but has been recalculated based on the new value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0 as it was not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]; prefix_sum[i + 2]` is updated to the new value of `prefix_sum[i + 1] + a[i + 1]`**
