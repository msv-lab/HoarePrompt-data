Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to split the array into multiple segments when necessary, especially in cases where the array has multiple segments with non-zero sums. For instance, consider the input:

```
8
9 -12 3 4 -4 -10 7 3
```

According to the problem description, the correct output should be:

```
YES
2
1 2
3 8
```

However, the provided code outputs:

```
YES
2
1 2
3 8
```

This output is correct, but the code does not handle more complex cases where the array needs to be split into more than two segments. For example, consider the input:

```
6
1 -2 3 4 -5 6
```

The correct output should be:

```
YES
2
1 3
4 6
```

But the provided code would incorrectly output:

```
YES
2
1 2
3 6
```

Since the code does not handle the case where the array needs to be split into more than two segments, it is not fully correct for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
