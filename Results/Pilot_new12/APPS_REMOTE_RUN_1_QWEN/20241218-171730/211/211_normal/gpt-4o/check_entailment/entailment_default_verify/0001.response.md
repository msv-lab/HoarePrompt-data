Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program still does not handle the case where the array consists entirely of zeros. According to the problem description and the output hints, the program should be able to split such an array into individual elements, each having a non-zero sum. However, the current implementation incorrectly outputs "NO" for such cases, failing to meet the requirements. The refined assessment confirms that the program needs to be revised to handle this edge case properly.
