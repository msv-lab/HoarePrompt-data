According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables (`total_sum` and the console output) remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop itself.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2', '3', `n`.**
