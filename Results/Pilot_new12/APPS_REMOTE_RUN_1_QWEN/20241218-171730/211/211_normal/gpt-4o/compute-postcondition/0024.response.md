The code simply prints 'YES' to the console, which does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `total_sum`, and the console outputs remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2', '3', `n'.**
