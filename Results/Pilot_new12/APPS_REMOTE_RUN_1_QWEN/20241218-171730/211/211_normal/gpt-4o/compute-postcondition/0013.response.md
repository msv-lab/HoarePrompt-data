The code `print(i + 2, n)` prints the value of `i + 2` and the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and the precondition does not specify a particular value for `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i + 2`. However, we know that `n` remains unchanged. The console outputs 'YES' and '1' followed by an undefined value for `i + 1`, which means `i + 1` is printed as '1', implying `i` is 0. This value of `i` is used in the print statement, so `i + 2` becomes 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES' and '1' followed by 2.**
