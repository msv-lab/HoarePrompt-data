Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'NO'.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `A` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies \(-10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\).
   - `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`.
   - `total_sum` is 0.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Inside the loop, there is a conditional check `if A[i] != 0:`.
   - If `A[i]` is non-zero, the loop prints 'YES', '2', '1', `i+1`, and 'i+2', `n`, and then breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding any non-zero element in `A`, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Observations from Output States**:
   - After the loop executes 1 time, `i` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES' and '1'.
   - After the loop executes 2 times, `i` is 3, and the console outputs additional lines.
   - After the loop executes 3 times, `i` is 4, and the console outputs additional lines.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The key observation is that the loop only prints 'YES' and exits if it finds a non-zero element in `A`.
   - Given that `total_sum` is 0, every element in `A` must be zero (since the sum of all elements is zero and there are no non-zero elements to contribute to the sum).
   - Therefore, the loop will never find a non-zero element, and it will always print 'NO' after completing all iterations.

Hence, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `total_sum` is 0.
- The console outputs 'NO'.
