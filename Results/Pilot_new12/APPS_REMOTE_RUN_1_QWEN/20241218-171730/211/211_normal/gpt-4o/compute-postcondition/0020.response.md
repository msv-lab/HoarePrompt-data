The code `print(i + 2, n)` prints the value of `i + 2` and `n`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the value of `i + 2` is 3. Since `n` is unchanged, its value remains as it was in the initial state. The other variables (`total_sum` and the console outputs) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2', '3' `n'**
