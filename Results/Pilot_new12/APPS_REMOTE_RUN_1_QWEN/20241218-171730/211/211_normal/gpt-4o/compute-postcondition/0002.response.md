The code `total_sum = sum(A)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `A` and assigns it to the variable `total_sum`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was used to determine the length of the list `A` but is not altered by the code. The state of `A` itself is not affected, but its sum is now stored in `total_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` contains `n` integers where each element `a_{i}` satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`.**
