The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop. In this case, it would exit the loop that the code is currently in, but since no loop is specified in the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. The console outputs are not affected by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, `total_sum` is 0, and the console outputs 'YES', '1', '2', '1 2', '3', '2', '1 6', '1 4' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
