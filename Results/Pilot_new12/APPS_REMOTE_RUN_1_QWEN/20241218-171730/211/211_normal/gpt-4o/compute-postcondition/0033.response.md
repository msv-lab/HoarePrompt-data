Functionality: **The function processes an array \(A\) of length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)) with elements satisfying \(-10^3 \leq a_{i} \leq 10^3\). It checks if the sum of the elements in the array is zero. If the sum is non-zero, it prints 'YES' followed by '1' and the value of \(n\). If the sum is zero, it iterates through the array to find the first non-zero element and prints 'YES' followed by '2', then the indices of two segments that together cover the non-zero element (i.e., '1' and the index of the non-zero element, and the index of the non-zero element plus one and 'n'). If no non-zero element is found, it prints 'NO'.**

This summary covers all the potential cases and actions performed by the code, including the edge case where no non-zero elements are present in the array.
