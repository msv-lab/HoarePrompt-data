According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `total_sum` is 0
- `i` is 0
- The console outputs 'YES' and '1' followed by 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), the loop will execute again if `i` is incremented to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `total_sum` remains 0
- `i` is now 1 (incremented from 0)
- The console still outputs 'YES' and '1' followed by 2

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and the console outputs 'YES' and '1' followed by 2**
