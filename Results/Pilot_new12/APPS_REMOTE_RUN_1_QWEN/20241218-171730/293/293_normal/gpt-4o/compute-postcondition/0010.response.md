The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` updates the value of `current_node` based on its current value. Initially, `current_node` is 0. Plugging this into the equation, we get:

```
current_node = 2 * 0 + 1 = 1
```

Therefore, `current_node` is updated to 1. The values of the other variables (`total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`, and `direction`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is non-empty, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1, `direction` is '0'**
