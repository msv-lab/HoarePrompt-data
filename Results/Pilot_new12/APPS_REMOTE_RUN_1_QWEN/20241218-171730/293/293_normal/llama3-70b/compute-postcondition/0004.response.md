`ans` is incremented by the value of `n // 2 - 1`. Given that `n` is currently even, the value of `n // 2` is half of `n`, and subtracting 1 from it means that `ans` is increased by `(n // 2) - 1`.

Since `n` is even, let's denote its value as `2k` (where `k` is an integer). Therefore, `n // 2` is `k`, and the expression simplifies to `k - 1`.

The initial value of `ans` is `0`, so after the operation, `ans` becomes `k - 1`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\) and the current value of `n` is even; `ans` is `n // 2 - 1`**
