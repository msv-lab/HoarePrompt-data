The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. This operation does not affect the value of `h` or `ans`. Given that `n` was previously updated to `n // 2` which is greater than 1, and `ans` is either `h // 2 - 1` if `n // 2` is even, or `ans + (n // 2)` if `n // 2` is odd, these conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, after executing the code, `n` is halved and becomes an integer value that is still greater than 1. The values of `h` and `ans` remain as per their initial conditions.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `ans` is either `h // 2 - 1` if `n // 2` is even, or `ans + (n // 2)` if `n // 2` is odd.**
