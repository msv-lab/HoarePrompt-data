Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, the output is 'NO', and the final direction `dir_f` is the last direction received. If `curr_lat` is exactly -90 and the final direction is not 'North', the output is 'NO'. If `curr_lat` is exactly 90 and the final direction is not 'South', the output is 'NO'.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates for `n` times, updating `curr_lat` based on the direction `dir` and the distance `t`.
- Each iteration checks if `curr_lat` is within the valid range (-90 to 90). If it goes out of bounds, the program prints 'NO' and exits.
- If `curr_lat` reaches -90, the direction must be 'North' for the loop to proceed without printing 'NO'.
- Similarly, if `curr_lat` reaches 90, the direction must be 'South' for the loop to proceed without printing 'NO'.
- After all iterations, the final state of `curr_lat` will be within the range -90 to 90 unless it was forced out of bounds during any iteration.
- The final direction `dir_f` will be the last direction received in the loop.
- The value of `n` must be at least 0 because if `n` is 0, the loop doesn't execute and the initial state remains `curr_lat = 90`.
