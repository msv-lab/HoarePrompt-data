The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. The output remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `curr_lat` remains within the range of -90 to 90, the output remains 'NO', `dir` is the second part of the input string, the value of `t` remains unchanged. If `curr_lat` is exactly -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the output remains 'NO'. If `curr_lat` is outside the range of -90 to 90, the program does nothing since the if condition ensures this case is handled only when `curr_lat` is already out of the valid range.**
