Functionality: **The function processes a series of movements in cardinal directions (North, South, West, East) and calculates the resulting latitude. It ensures that the latitude remains within the valid range of -90 to 90 degrees. If at any point the latitude goes out of this range or if the final latitude is exactly -90 and the last movement was not North, or if the final latitude is exactly 90 and the last movement was not South, the function outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of movements, and `n` pairs of integers and directions as input. It does not return any value.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If the latitude exceeds -90 or 90 degrees at any point during the processing, the function immediately outputs 'NO' and exits.
- If the final latitude is exactly -90 and the last movement was not 'North', the function outputs 'NO'.
- If the final latitude is exactly 90 and the last movement was not 'South', the function outputs 'NO'.

Missing Functionality:
- The function does not handle the cases where the direction is either 'West' or 'East'. These directions do not affect the latitude, but since the code currently continues without performing any action when the direction is neither 'North' nor 'South', it effectively ignores these inputs. However, it should be noted that the function's current behavior is sufficient given the provided annotations.
