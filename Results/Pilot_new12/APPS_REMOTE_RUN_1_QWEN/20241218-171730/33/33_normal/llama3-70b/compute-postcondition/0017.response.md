Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]. If `curr_lat` is initially out of this range, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, `curr_lat` is adjusted based on the value of `dir`: if `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` becomes 90 + t / 111.195. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` becomes 90 - t / 111.195. The values of `t` and `dir` remain unchanged.***
