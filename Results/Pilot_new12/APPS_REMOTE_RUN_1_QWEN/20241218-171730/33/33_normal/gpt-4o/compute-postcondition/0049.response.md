`position` is decreased by the value of `t`. The initial value of `position` is within the range [0, 20000], and the value of `t` is obtained from the input conversion. Since no change is mentioned for the conditions involving `position - t < 0`, the states of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `valid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `t` is an integer from the input conversion, `dir` is the second part of the input from the split, `position` is within the range [0, 20000] - `t`, and `valid` is `False`.**
