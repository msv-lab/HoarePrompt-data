The code assigns the value `False` to the variable `valid`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the only difference in the output state is the assignment of `False` to `valid`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'South', the current value of `dir` is 'South', and `valid` is `False`.**
