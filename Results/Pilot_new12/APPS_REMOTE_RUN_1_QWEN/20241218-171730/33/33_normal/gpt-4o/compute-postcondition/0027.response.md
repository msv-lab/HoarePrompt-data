Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `position` is within the range [0, 20000] and `valid` is True, unless `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, in which case `valid` is False.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring that the final state of `position` and `valid` adheres to the specified rules, while maintaining the initial conditions on `n`, `t`, and `dir`.
