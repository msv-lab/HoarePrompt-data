The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables (`t_i` and `dir_i`) remain unaffected. Since the input is read from the user, the exact value of `n` is unknown until the user inputs it.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6 for each i in range 1 to n; `dir_i` is a string representing the direction of movement which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East" for each i in range 1 to n.**
