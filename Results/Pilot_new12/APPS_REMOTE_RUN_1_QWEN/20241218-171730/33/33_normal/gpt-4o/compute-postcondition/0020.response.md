The code `valid = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `valid`. No other variables are affected. The initial states of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `position` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is `False`**
