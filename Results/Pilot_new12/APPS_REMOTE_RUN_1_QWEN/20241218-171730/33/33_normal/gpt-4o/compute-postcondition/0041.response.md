Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first input from the split, `dir` is the second input value from the split, `position` is within the range [0, 20000], and `valid` is determined as follows: if `dir` is 'North', `position` is updated to `position - t` and `valid` remains the same based on the initial condition (True if `position - t >= 0`, False otherwise). If `dir` is 'South', `valid` remains `False` if `(position + t) > 20000`; otherwise, `valid` remains `True`. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', `valid` remains `True` unless `position` is either 0 or 20000, in which case `valid` becomes `False`.**
