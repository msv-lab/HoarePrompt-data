Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that Limak can only move to the South if he is on the North Pole and only to the North if he is on the South Pole. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
20000 South
1000 North
10000 North
```

- Initially, Limak is on the North Pole (position = 20000).
- The first instruction moves Limak 20000 km South, which puts him exactly on the South Pole (position = 0).
- The second instruction moves Limak 1000 km North, putting him 1000 km away from the South Pole (position = 1000).
- The third instruction moves Limak another 10000 km North, which would place him beyond the North Pole (position = 11000), which is invalid since the maximum allowed position is 20000.

The program does not check if Limakâ€™s movement exceeds the boundaries considering the current pole position, hence it will incorrectly validate this scenario and output "YES" instead of "NO".
