Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the longest non-palindromic substring in a given word. It iterates through all possible substrings of the input string `s`, checks if a substring is not a palindrome, and keeps track of the maximum length of such a substring. If no non-palindromic substring is found, it returns 0. This approach covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and matches the provided examples and hints.
