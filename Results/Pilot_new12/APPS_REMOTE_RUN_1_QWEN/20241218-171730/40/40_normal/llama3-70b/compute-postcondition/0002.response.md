The code initializes `max_len` to 0. The initial state of `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters, and `n` is the length of `s`. After executing the code, the value of `max_len` is set to 0, but the values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 50 characters; `n` is the length of `s`; `max_len` is 0.**
