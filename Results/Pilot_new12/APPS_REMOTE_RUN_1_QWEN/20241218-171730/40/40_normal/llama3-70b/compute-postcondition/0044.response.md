The code snippet `substr = s[i:j]` assigns a substring of `s` from index `i` to `j-1` (since slicing in Python is half-open) to the variable `substr`. The value of `j` is set to `i + 3`. This means the substring `substr` will be `s[i:i+3]`.

The variables `i`, `s`, `n`, and `max_len` are not directly affected by this assignment. However, the new value of `substr` needs to be included in the output state.

Output State: **`substr` is `s[i:i+3]`, `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, and `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`, `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`, and it is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the length of the substring from index `i` to `j-1` where `j` is `i + 3`.**
