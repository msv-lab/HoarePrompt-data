The code snippet assigns the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j_prev - 1` (not including `j_prev`) to the variable `substr`. The value of `j` is not affected by this assignment, and other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j_prev - 1` and is not equal to its reverse).
- `j` is `j_prev + 1`.

After the code runs, `substr` now holds the substring from index `i` to `j_prev - 1`. All other variables remain in their original state except for `substr`.

Output State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`; `s` is a non-empty string; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j_prev - 1` and is not equal to its reverse); `j` is `j_prev + 1`; `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j_prev - 1`.**
