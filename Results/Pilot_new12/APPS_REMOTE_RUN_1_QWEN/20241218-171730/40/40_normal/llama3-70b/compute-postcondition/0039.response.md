Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `n` is greater than `i + 2`.
   - `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i + 2` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`.
   - `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the length of `substr`.
   - `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **State Changes:**
   - After each iteration of the loop, the variable `j` is incremented.
   - `max_len` is updated based on the length of `substr` if `substr` is not a palindrome.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - The condition `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n + 1` remains unchanged as it is a boundary condition and does not change during the loop execution.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `j` starts from `i + 1` and increases by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 2`.
   - `max_len` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of the new `substr` (from `i` to `j-1`).

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `j` will be `i + 2`.
- `max_len` will be the maximum of its current value and the length of the new `substr` (which is the substring from `i` to `j-1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i + 2` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`, and now `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the length of the substring from index `i` to `j-1`, and `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`; `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` where `j` is `i + 2`.**
