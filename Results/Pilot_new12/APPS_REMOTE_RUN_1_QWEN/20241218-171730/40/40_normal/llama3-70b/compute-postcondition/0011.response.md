The code updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is a single character from `s` starting at index `i`, the length of `substr` is 1. Therefore, `max_len` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that `i < n`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, `substr` is a single character from `s` starting at index `i`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 1.**
