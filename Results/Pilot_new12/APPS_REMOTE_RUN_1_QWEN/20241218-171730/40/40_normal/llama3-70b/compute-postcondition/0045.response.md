The code snippet `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))` updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

Given that `substr` is defined as `s[i:i+3]`, `len(substr)` is 3 because `substr` is a substring of length 3.

Therefore, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 3.

Output State: **`substr` is `s[i:i+3]`, `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, and `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`, `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and 3.**
