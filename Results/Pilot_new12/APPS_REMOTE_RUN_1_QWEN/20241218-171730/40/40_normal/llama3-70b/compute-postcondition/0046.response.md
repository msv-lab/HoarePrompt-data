Postcondition: ***`substr` is `s[i:i+3]`, `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 2` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, and `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. `max_len` is the maximum length of any non-palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to any valid end index `j` where `i + 3 <= j <= n`, and it is updated to be the maximum of its original value and either 3 (if the substring is not palindromic) or the length of the substring from index `i` to `j-1` (if the substring is palindromic).***
