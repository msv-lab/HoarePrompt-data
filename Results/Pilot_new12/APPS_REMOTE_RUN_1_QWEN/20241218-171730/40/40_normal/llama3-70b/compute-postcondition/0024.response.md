According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were true:
- `i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` and is not equal to its reverse).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`, and `j` should be incremented by 1 from the previous value.

Let's denote the previous value of `j` as `j_prev`. Since the loop is iterating through `range(i + 1, n + 1)`, `j_prev` would be `i + 1` if it was the first iteration, but generally, it would be `j_prev + 1` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_prev + 1`.

To determine `j_prev`, we need to consider the conditions given:
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`, ensuring the loop can run.
- `max_len` has already been updated based on the substring from `i` to `j-1`.

Since `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, and given that `j_prev` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, the new state will have `j` as `j_prev + 1`.

Given that `j` is within the range defined by `i + 1` to `n + 1`, and assuming no further constraints are given, the only state change needed is for `j` to be incremented.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j_prev - 1` and is not equal to its reverse).** 

And `j` is adjusted to `j_prev + 1`.

However, since `j_prev` is not explicitly given, let's denote the previous value of `j` as `j_prev`. Therefore, the final state can be represented as:

State: **`i` is a valid starting index such that `i + 1` is within bounds of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr` (where `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j_prev - 1` and is not equal to its reverse), and `j` is `j_prev + 1`.**
