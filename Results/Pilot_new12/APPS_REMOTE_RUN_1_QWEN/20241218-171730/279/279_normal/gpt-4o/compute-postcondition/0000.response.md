The line `input = sys.stdin.read` does not modify the existing variables but rather reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This means that when `input()` is called later in the program, it will read the entire standard input at once instead of prompting for input one line at a time. However, the values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation, `b` is a list of n integers consisting only of 0s and 1s, and the built-in `input` function is now `sys.stdin.read`.**
