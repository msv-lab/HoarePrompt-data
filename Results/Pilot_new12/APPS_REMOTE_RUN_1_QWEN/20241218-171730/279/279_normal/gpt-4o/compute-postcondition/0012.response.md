`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. Since `x` is 0, `visited[0]` is set to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `visited[0]` is `True`, and `cycle` is an empty list `[]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `visited[0]` is `True`, and `cycle` is an empty list `[]`**
