`x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 2, `x` is the last node in the cycle, all nodes in the cycle have `visited` set to True, `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list.
