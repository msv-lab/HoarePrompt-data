`x` is appended to the `cycle` list. The value of `x` is `p[1] - 1`, and since `visited[p[1] - 1]` is already True, no new information about `x` is introduced beyond its value being `p[1] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains the value [1, p[1] - 1], `x` is p[1] - 1, `visited[1]` is True, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list, `visited[p[1] - 1]` is True**
