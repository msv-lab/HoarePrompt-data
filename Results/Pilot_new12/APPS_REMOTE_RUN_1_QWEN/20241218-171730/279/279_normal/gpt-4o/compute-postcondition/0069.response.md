The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, and `b` is a list of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.

Case_1: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, and `b` is a list of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s. The function returns a specific value based on certain conditions involving `p` and `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `p`, and `b` and return a value based on specific conditions involving `p` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `p`, and `b`, where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, and `b` is a list of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s. Based on certain conditions involving `p` and `b`, it returns a specific value.**
