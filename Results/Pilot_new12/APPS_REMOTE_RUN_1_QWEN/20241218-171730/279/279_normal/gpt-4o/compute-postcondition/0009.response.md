The code `cycle = []` initializes an empty list named `cycle`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or the current value of `visited[i]`. The initial state of `visited[i]` is `False`, and `i` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `visited[0]` is False, and `cycle` is an empty list `[]`.**
