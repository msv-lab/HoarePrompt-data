`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. Given that `x` is 1, `visited[1]` is updated to `True`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited[0]` is True, `visited[2]` is True, `cycle` is [2], `x` is 1, `visited[1]` is True, all nodes in the cycle have `visited` set to False, `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list.**
