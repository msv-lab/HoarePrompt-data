Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains all nodes in the cycle in the order they were visited, `x` is the last node in the cycle, all nodes in the cycle have `visited` set to True, `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list. This is true whether or not `visited[i]` is True, as there is no else part that changes these conditions.***
