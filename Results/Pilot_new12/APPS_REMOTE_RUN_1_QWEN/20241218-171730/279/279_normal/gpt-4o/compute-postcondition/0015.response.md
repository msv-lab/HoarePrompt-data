Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `visited[0]` is `True`.
   - `cycle` is `[p[x] - 1]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `not visited[x]` (i.e., `visited[x]` is `False`).

3. **Current Values:**
   - `visited[0]` is `True`, which means the condition `not visited[x]` is currently `False`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `visited[x]` must be `False`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to set `visited[x]` to `False`.
   - The other states (`n`, `i`, and `cycle`) do not affect the loop condition directly and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `visited[x]` to `False`.

**State:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `visited[0]` is `True`, `cycle` is `[p[x] - 1]`, `visited[x]` is `False`**
