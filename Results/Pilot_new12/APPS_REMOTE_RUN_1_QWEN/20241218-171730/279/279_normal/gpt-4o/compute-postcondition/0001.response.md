The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user (using `sys.stdin.read`) and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This operation affects the `data` variable, converting it from non-existent in the initial state to a list of strings derived from the input. The variables `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation, `b` is a list of n integers consisting only of 0s and 1s, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**
