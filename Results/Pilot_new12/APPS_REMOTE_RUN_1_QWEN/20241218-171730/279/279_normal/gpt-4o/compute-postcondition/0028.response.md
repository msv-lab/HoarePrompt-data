The code assigns the current value of `i` to `x`. Since `i` is 1, `x` will also be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list.**
