The code `cycles.append(cycle)` appends the `cycle` list to the `cycles` list. The `cycle` list contains all nodes in the cycle in the order they were visited, and the `cycles` list includes this `cycle` list. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` contains all nodes in the cycle in the order they were visited, `x` is the last node in the cycle, all nodes in the cycle have `visited` set to True, `cycles` now includes the `cycle` list.**
