Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `data` is a list of strings, `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating if the corresponding index was visited during the loop, `cycles` is a list of lists representing the cycles found in the graph defined by `p`, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of boolean values determined by whether all elements in each cycle are equal to 0 in the list `b`. If the length of `cycles` is exactly 1, a value of `0` is printed. Otherwise, if `no_reverse_components` is greater than 0, it is printed; otherwise, `1` is printed.***
