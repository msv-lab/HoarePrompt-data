Output State: **`visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` contains all values of `x` that were visited until the loop terminates; `x` is the final value of `x` when the loop exits**

Explanation:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `visited[0]` is False.
   - `cycle` is an empty list `[]`.
   - `x` is 0.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues to execute as long as `visited[x]` is `False`.
   - Each iteration marks `visited[x]` as `True`, appends `x` to `cycle`, and updates `x` to `p[x] - 1`.

3. **Final State Analysis**:
   - Once the loop exits, `visited[x]` must be `True` because the loop terminates only when `visited[x]` becomes `True`.
   - `cycle` will contain all the values of `x` that were visited during the loop execution, starting from the initial value of `x` (which is 0) until the final value of `x` when the loop exits.
   - The final value of `x` is the one that causes `visited[x]` to become `True`, ending the loop.

Thus, the output state of the loop is that `visited[x]` is `True`, `cycle` contains all the values of `x` that were visited during the loop execution, and `x` is the final value of `x` when the loop exits.
