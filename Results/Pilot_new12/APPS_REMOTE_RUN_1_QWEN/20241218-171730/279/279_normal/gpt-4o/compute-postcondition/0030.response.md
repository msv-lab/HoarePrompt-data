`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. Since `x` is 1, `visited[1]` is set to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1, `visited[1]` is True, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1, `visited[1]` is True, `cycles` includes the `cycle` list.**
