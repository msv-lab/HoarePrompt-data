Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The code simply counts the number of positions where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and the number of positions where `b[i]` is 0. However, this approach does not ensure that every skewer will visit every of its 2n placements.

To meet the problem requirements, the code should:
1. Ensure that every skewer visits all positions in both directions.
2. Minimize the changes to the permutation and sequence `b`.

The given solution does not account for the necessary transformations of the permutation and sequence `b` to ensure that each skewer visits all 2n placements. For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1
```

The provided code outputs:
```
2
```

However, the correct answer should be 2. Pavel can change the permutation to `4, 3, 1, 2` and keep the sequence `b` as it is. This ensures that each skewer visits all 2n placements.

Another example:
**Input:**
```
3
2 3 1
0 0 0
```

The provided code outputs:
```
1
```

The correct answer should be 1. Pavel can change the sequence `b` to `[0, 0, 1]` to ensure that each skewer visits all 2n placements.

Since the provided code does not correctly handle these cases and fails to ensure that every skewer visits all 2n placements, the correctness of the program is **False**.
