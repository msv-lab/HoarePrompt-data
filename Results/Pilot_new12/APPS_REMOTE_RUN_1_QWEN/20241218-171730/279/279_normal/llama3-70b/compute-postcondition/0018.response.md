Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is 4, and `i` is 4. If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, the condition is met as described. There is no change to the values of `n`, `b`, `ans`, or `i` in the if part, and since there is no else part, the values remain unchanged.***
