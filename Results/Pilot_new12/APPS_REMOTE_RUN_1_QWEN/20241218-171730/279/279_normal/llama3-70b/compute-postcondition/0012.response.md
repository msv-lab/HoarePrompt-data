`ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` is 1, so after the increment, `ans` becomes 2. The values of `n`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is 2, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is 2, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3**
