Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. It reads these parameters from the user, where `n` is an integer indicating the length of permutations and sequences, `p` is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`, and `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s. The function calculates and returns the count of indices `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) where either `p[i]` is not equal to `i+1` or `b[i]` is equal to 0. The function handles the case where `n` is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). If both `p[i]` and `b[i]` are valid and satisfy the condition `p[i] == i + 1` and `b[i] == 1`, such indices do not contribute to the final count. The function prints the calculated count at the end.**
