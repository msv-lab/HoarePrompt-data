The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but the initial conditions regarding `p` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `p` is a permutation of length `n` consisting of integers from 1 to `n`, and `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.**
