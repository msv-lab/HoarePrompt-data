The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func():`. The parameter constraints mentioned (n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10 000 000) do not apply since no parameters are defined within the function.

Given the output cases, it seems the function should handle some internal logic based on these constraints, but since the function signature does not include any parameters, we cannot directly reference n, a, and b in the description.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything based on the provided constraints.**
