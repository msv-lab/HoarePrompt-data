The initial state is defined as follows:
- `y` is \((n - x * a) // b\)
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `a` is a positive integer
- `x` is \(x + 1\)
- `b` is unspecified

The code snippet is:
```python
y = (n - x * a) // b
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code:
- `x` was originally \(x + 1\), so the new value of `x` is \(x + 1\).
- `y` is reassigned to \((n - x * a) // b\).

Since `b` is unspecified and we don't have a specific value for it, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `y`. However, we can express `y` in terms of the given variables.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `x` is \(x + 1\)
- `y` is \((n - (x + 1) * a) // b\)

Output State: **`x` is \(x + 1\); `y` is \((n - (x + 1) * a) // b\)**
