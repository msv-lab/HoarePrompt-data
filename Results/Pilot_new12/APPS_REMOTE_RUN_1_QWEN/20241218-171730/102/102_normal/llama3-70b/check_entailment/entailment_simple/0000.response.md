Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the program ensures correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) from the standard input. These inputs are expected to be within the specified ranges (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000).

2. **Iterative Search for Solution**:
   - The program uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \( x \) (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) up to \( n // a \). This ensures that \( x \cdot a \leq n \).
   - For each value of \( x \), it calculates the remaining amount of money \( n - x \cdot a \) and checks if this remaining amount can be exactly divided by \( b \) (the cost of one Bars bar).
   - If \( (n - x \cdot a) \% b == 0 \), then the value of \( y \) (the number of Bars bars) is calculated as \( y = (n - x \cdot a) // b \).
   - It then checks if \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b == n \). If true, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of \( x \) and \( y \), and exits the program.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - If no combination of \( x \) and \( y \) satisfies the equation \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b == n \) during the loop, the program prints 'NO'.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Comprehensive Search**: The program systematically checks all possible combinations of \( x \) and \( y \) within the constraints. Since \( x \) ranges from 0 to \( n // a \), it covers all feasible values for \( x \), ensuring that all possible solutions are checked.
- **Correct Calculation**: The calculations inside the loop ensure that the conditions \( x \cdot a + y \cdot b == n \) are checked accurately. The use of integer division and modulus operations ensures that the values of \( y \) and the condition check are handled correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where no solution exists by printing 'NO' at the end. This covers scenarios where no combination of \( x \) and \( y \) satisfies the equation.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
