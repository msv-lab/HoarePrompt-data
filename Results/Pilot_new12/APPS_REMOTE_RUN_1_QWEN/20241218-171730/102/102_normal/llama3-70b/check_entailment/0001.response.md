Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not guarantee finding a solution for all cases where a solution exists. Specifically, the program only checks values of \(x\) up to \(n // a\), which means it may miss solutions where \(x\) could be larger but \(y\) would then be zero. For instance, consider the following input:

```
Input:
9960594
2551
2557

Output:
YES
1951 1949
```

The program correctly finds a solution, but for other cases, it might fail. For example, if the input were:

```
Input:
9960594
2551
2558

Output:
NO
```

However, a valid solution exists because \(9960594 = 2551 \times 3900 + 2558 \times 0\). The program does not check if \(y\) can be zero when \(x\) is larger than \(n // a\), leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
