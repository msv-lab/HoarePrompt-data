Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code assumes that there will always be a solution (i.e., there will always be non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\)). However, this is not always true. According to the problem description, if no such \(x\) and \(y\) exist, the program should output "NO". 

The code only checks for the existence of a valid pair \((x, y)\) by iterating up to \(n // a + 1\). This means that if \(n\) cannot be expressed as \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b\) with non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\), the loop will terminate without finding a solution, and it will incorrectly print "NO". 

To illustrate, consider the following case:

**Example:**
- Input:
  ```
  15
  4
  8
  ```

The correct output should be "NO" because there are no non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(4x + 8y = 15\). However, the provided code will incorrectly print "YES" with some arbitrary values of \(x\) and \(y\) if it happens to enter the loop, which it does not in this case but could for other inputs.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description, making it incorrect.
