`y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. Given the precondition `(n - x * a) % b` equals 0, it means that `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`, so the floor division `(n - x * a) // b` will give an integer value. This value is assigned to `y`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is a non-negative integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, the expression `(n - x * a) % b` equals 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is the integer result of `(n - x * a) // b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is a non-negative integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, the expression `(n - x * a) % b` equals 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is the integer result of `(n - x * a) // b**.
