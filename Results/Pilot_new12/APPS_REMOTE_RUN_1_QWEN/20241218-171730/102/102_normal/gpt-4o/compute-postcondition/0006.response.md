The code `print('YES')` does not modify any variables but simply prints 'YES'. The conditions and values of the variables before the print statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is a non-negative integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, the expression `(n - x * a) % b` equals 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is the integer result of `(n - x * a) // b, printed value is 'YES'**
