You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer obtained from input.
- `a` is an integer obtained from input.
- `b` is an integer obtained from input.

### Loop Analysis
The loop runs for `x` in the range `n // a + 1`. For each iteration, it checks if \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\). If this condition is met, it sets \(y\) to \((n - x * a) // b\) and prints 'YES' followed by the values of \(x\) and \(y\), then returns. If the condition is not met, the loop continues to the next iteration.

### Key Observations
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will only execute if \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\) is true for some \(x\) in the range \(0\) to \(n // a\).
2. **Return Statement**: The loop returns immediately when the condition is satisfied, so the loop can only execute once.
3. **No Further Iteration**: Once the loop finds a valid pair \((x, y)\), it exits without further iterations.

### Output State After All Iterations

#### Case 1: Loop Executes
- If the loop executes, it means there exists an integer \(x\) such that \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\). When this happens:
  - \(y = (n - x * a) // b\)
  - The function prints 'YES' and the values of \(x\) and \(y\)
  - The function returns

Since the loop only executes once, the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) do not change.

#### Case 2: Loop Does Not Execute
- If the loop does not execute, it means for all \(x\) in the range \(0\) to \(n // a\), the condition \((n - x * a) \% b == 0\) is false.
- In this case, the function does not print 'YES' or any values and simply returns without changing the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\).

### Final Output State

- If the loop executes at least once, the function will have printed 'YES' and the values of \(x\) and \(y\), and returned. Hence, \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) retain their original values.
- If the loop does not execute, the function simply returns without printing or changing the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\).

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

**Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input, `a` is an integer obtained from input, `b` is an integer obtained from input. The function will either print 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y` and return, or it will return without any print statements and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
```
print('NO')

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
