The code reads `n` integers from the input and stores them in a list `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, but `a` is now a list containing the integers provided by the input. Since the exact integers are not specified, we'll denote them as `a_i` where `1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^3`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list containing n integers a_i such that 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^3**
