The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to take input from the user or another source, specifically:
- An integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- A list of `n` integers \(a_i\) such that \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\).

Based on these inputs, the function will process the data but does not return any value as per the provided output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and a list of `n` strictly increasing integers within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and a list of `n` integers \(a_i\) such that \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\).**
