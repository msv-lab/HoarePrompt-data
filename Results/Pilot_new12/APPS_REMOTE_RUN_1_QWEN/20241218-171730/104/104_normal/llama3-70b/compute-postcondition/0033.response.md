The code updates the value of `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 2`, and `max_erase` is the maximum of its current value and `j - i - 1`.

First, calculate `j - i - 1`:
- `j` is `n + 2`
- `i` is 2
- So, `j - i - 1` is `(n + 2) - 2 - 1` which simplifies to `n - 1`

Therefore, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `n - 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 2`, `max_erase` is the maximum of its current value and `n - 1`.**
