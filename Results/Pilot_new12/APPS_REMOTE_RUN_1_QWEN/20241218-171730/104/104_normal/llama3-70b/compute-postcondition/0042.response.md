Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers representing an increasing sequence of length between 1 and 100. It then iterates over all possible sublists of the given list, checking if the elements in each sublist satisfy the condition \(a[k] - a[i] == k - i\) for all \(k\) in the range \([i, j)\). The function calculates the maximum length of such sublists and returns this maximum length as the output. If no valid sublist is found, the function returns 0.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input list is empty, the function should handle this case by not performing any operations, and since no valid sublist can exist, it returns 0.
- The input list can have a minimum length of 1, in which case the function checks only one possible sublist (the entire list), and returns the maximum length if the condition is satisfied, otherwise 0.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided code and annotations do not explicitly handle the case where the input list is empty. While the current implementation would return 0 in this case due to the nature of the for loops, it is worth noting for completeness.
