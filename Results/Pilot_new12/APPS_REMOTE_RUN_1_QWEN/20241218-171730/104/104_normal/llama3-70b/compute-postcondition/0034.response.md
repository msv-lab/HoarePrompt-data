Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, and `j` is `n + 2`. If all elements in the sublist `a[i:j]` satisfy the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for every `k` in the range from `i` to `j-1`, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its current value and `n - 1`. Otherwise, the state of `max_erase` remains unchanged.***
