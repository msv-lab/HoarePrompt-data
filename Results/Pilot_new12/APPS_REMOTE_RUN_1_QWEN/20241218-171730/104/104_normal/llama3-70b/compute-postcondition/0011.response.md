Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `max_erase` is the maximum of 0 and `j - i - 1`, which simplifies to `max(0, 2 - 0 - 1) = 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it `3`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j <= n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `j` is now 3.
   - `max_erase` remains 1 (it does not change within the loop).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `max_erase` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `max_erase` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
