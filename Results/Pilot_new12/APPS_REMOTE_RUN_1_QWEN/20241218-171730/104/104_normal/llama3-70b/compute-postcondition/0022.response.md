Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 1, `j` is 3. If for all elements in the sublist from index `i` to `j-1`, the difference between each element and `a[i]` equals the difference between their indices, then `max_erase` is 1. Otherwise, `max_erase` remains the same as its previous value and is at most 2 (since `j - i - 1` is 1, and `max_erase` is capped at this value). `n` must still be greater than 0.**
