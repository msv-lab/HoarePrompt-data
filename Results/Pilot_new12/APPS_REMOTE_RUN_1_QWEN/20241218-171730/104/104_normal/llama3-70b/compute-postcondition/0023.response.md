Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `max_erase` is either 1 or remains the same as its previous value (at most 2).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the bounds defined by `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the last iteration:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `max_erase` is either 1 or remains the same as its previous value (at most 2).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `j < n + 1` holds true.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.
   - `max_erase` remains the same as its previous value (at most 2).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `max_erase` is either 1 or remains the same as its previous value (at most 2), `n` must still be greater than 0.**
