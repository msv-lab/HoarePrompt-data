Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the coordinates of the points to form a triangle with the specified area in every case. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > m\). In such cases, the program incorrectly prints points that do not satisfy the constraints \(0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n\) and \(0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m\).

For example, consider the input \(n = 2\), \(m = 2\), and \(k = 3\):

- \( \text{area} = \frac{2 \times 2}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \), which is not an integer, so the program should print "NO". However, the program does not handle this case correctly and prints "YES" along with coordinates, which are out of bounds.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the coordinates generated are within the given ranges and correctly form a triangle with the required area.
