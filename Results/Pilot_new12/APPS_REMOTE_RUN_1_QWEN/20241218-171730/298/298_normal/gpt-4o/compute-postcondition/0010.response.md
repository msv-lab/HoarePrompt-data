The code `print('0 0')` prints the string '0 0' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `area`, or the console printout 'YES'. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`, and the console prints 'YES'**
