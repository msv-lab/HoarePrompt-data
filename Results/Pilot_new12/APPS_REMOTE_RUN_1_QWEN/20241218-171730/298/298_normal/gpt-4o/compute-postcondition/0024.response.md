Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. `area` is initially calculated as `n * m / k`. If `area` is not an integer, the output is 'NO'. If `area` is an integer:
- If `area == 0`, the string 'NO' is printed.
- If `2 * area <= n`, then `area` is updated to `n / 2` and the console prints '0 1'.
- If `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`, then `area` remains `n * m / k` and the console prints '1 0'.
- Otherwise, `area` becomes `n * (m // 2) / k` and the console prints '0 {m // 2} YES'.***
