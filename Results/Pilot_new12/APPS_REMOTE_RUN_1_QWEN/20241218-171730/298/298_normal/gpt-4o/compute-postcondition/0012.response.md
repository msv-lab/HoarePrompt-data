The code `print(f'{2 * area} 1')` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `area`, or the condition `2 * area <= n`. Instead, it prints the value of `2 * area` followed by `1` to the console.

Given the initial conditions:
- `area` is calculated as `n * m / k` and also equals `n / 2` because `2 * area <= n` implies `area = n / 2`.
- The console prints 'YES'.

Since `area` is `n / 2`, `2 * area` would be `2 * (n / 2)`, which simplifies to `n`.

Therefore, the print statement outputs `n 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n / 2`, the console prints 'n 1'**
