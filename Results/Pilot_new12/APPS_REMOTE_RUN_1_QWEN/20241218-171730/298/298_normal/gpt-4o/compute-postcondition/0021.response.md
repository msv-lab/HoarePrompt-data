Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `area` is recalculated as follows: if `2 * area <= m`, then `area` remains `n * m / k` and the console prints '1 0'. Otherwise, `area` becomes `n * (m // 2) / k` and the console prints '0 {m // 2} YES'.**
