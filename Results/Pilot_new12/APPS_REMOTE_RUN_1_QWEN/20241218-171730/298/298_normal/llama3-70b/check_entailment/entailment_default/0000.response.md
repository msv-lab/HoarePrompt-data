Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully meet the problem description. Specifically, the logic to determine if the points form a triangle with the required area is flawed. The program checks if \( n \times m \% k = 0 \) and then attempts to find points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\) such that the area of the triangle is \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

However, the way the points are selected and the area calculation is not correctly implemented. The program uses the GCD and related functions to find values but does not correctly ensure that the selected points form a triangle with the desired area.

For instance, consider the input:
```
4 3 3
```
The area of the triangle should be 4. The code prints "YES" and provides coordinates \((0, 0)\), \((0, 4)\), \((3, 0)\), which do not form a valid triangle with the required area. The area of the triangle formed by these points is 0, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
