Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to find three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) and extended Euclidean algorithm but do not contribute to solving the problem of finding the triangle's coordinates.

To solve this problem, the program needs to generate three points such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\). However, the given functions do not address this requirement. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for any potential case.
