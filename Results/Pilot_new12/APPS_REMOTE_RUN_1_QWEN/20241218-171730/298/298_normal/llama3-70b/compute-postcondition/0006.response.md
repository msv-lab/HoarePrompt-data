Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with \(b \neq 0\)) and implements a recursive version of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. If `b` is zero, the function returns `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with parameters `b` and `a % b`, and returns the values `y` and `x - a // b * y`, where `x` and `y` are the results of the recursive call. This process continues until `b` becomes zero.**

**Edge Cases:**
- When `b` is zero, the function directly returns `(1, 0)`.
- The function correctly handles the recursive case by updating the values of `x` and `y` based on the Euclidean algorithm's properties.

**Final State:**
- After the function concludes, it returns a pair of integers `(y, x - a // b * y)`, which are the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, satisfying the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
