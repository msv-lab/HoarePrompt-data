Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the minimum values taken from each keg to meet the requirement of `s` liters is less than `s`. Specifically, the binary search approach used in the program may fail to find the correct minimum amount of kvass that can be in the least keg while still meeting the requirement of `s` liters. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 6
4 3 5
```

The correct output should be `3`, because the Fair Nut can take 1 liter from the first keg and 2 liters from the third keg, leaving 3 liters in each keg. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` because it fails to correctly adjust the binary search boundaries to find this solution. The binary search implementation might not properly converge to the correct minimum value due to the way the boundaries are updated.
