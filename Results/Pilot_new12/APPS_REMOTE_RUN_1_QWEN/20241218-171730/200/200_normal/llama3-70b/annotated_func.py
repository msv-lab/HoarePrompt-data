#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers \( n \) and \( s \) where \( 1 \le n \le 10^3 \) and \( 1 \le s \le 10^{12} \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \) where \( 1 \le v_i \le 10^9 \).
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, `v` is a sorted list of integers created from the third input, `low` is 0, `high` is the smallest value such that the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`, `mid` is the last calculated mid value, and `total` is the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v`.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is the first integer input, `s` is the second integer input, `v` is a sorted list of integers created from the third input, `low` is 0, `high` is the smallest value such that the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`, `mid` is the last calculated mid value, and `total` is the sum of the minimum between `mid` and each element `x` in the list `v`. If the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in the list `v` is not equal to `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `low` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list of `n` integers `v`. It first sorts the list `v`. Then, it performs a binary search to find the smallest value `low` such that the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element `x` in the list `v` is at least `s`. If no such `low` exists, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `low`. The function ensures that the inputs `n`, `s`, and `v` satisfy the given constraints: \(1 \le n \le 10^3\), \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), and \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\). If any of these constraints are violated, the function will terminate with an error, though this is not explicitly handled within the provided code.
