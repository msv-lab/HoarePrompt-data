The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or block of code. Since no loop or block is specified in the given code, the only impact is that the execution will exit the current context, but the variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`) or reduced by `possible_to_take` (if `volumes[i]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`), and `possible_to_take` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
