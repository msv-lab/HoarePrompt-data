Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\); `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\); `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list, and the current value of `total_volume` is less than `s`.**
