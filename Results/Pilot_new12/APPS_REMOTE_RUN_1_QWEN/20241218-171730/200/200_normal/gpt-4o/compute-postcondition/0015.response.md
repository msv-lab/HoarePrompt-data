Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, then no change is made to `remaining_kvass`. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is set to the minimum value between `volumes[i] - min_keg_volume` and `remaining_kvass`, and `remaining_kvass` is reduced by `possible_to_take`.***
