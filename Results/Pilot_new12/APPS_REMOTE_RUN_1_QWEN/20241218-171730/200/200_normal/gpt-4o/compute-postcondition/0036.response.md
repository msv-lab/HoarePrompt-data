Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`, `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list, `min_keg_volume` is reduced by \((\text{remaining\_kvass} + n - 1) // n\) and `remaining_kvass` is the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume` and its current value is greater than 0.**
