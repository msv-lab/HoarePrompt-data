The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, we assume that this line of code is within a loop, but its effect is to simply continue to the next iteration without changing any variable values. 

Therefore, the values of the variables `n` and `volumes[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; the current value of `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`.**
