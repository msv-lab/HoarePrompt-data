`remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`. Since `possible_to_take` is defined as `min(volumes[1] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)`, the value of `remaining_kvass` is updated accordingly. The values of `n`, `i`, and `possible_to_take` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (if `volumes[1]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`) or reduced by `possible_to_take` (if `volumes[1]` is greater than `min_keg_volume`), `possible_to_take` is `min(volumes[1] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)` - `possible_to_take`, and `i` is 1.**
