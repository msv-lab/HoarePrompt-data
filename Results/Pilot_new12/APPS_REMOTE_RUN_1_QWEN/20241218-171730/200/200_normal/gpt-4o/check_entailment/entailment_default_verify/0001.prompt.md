You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the least keg has as much kvass as possible after pouring \( s \) liters of kvass. 

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
4 5
3 3 3 3

Expected Output:
3

Actual Output:
2
```

In this case, the program sorts the volumes and starts distributing the required \( s \) liters of kvass. However, it does not ensure that the least keg has the maximum possible amount of kvass. Instead, it simply distributes the remaining kvass evenly among the kegs, which may result in a lesser amount in the least keg than possible.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the least keg is prioritized to have as much kvass as possible. This can be achieved by adjusting the distribution logic to first try to maximize the least keg's volume before distributing the remaining kvass.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integers `n` and `s`, and a list `v` of `n` integers. It first sorts the list `v` in ascending order. Then, it checks if the sum of the elements in `v` is less than `s`. If it is, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it initializes `min_keg_volume` to the smallest element in `v` and calculates the remaining kvass needed (`remaining_kvass`). It iterates through the list `v`, adjusting `min_keg_volume` based on the difference between the current element and `min_keg_volume`, until `remaining_kvass` is zero or the loop exits. If `remaining_kvass` is still greater than zero after the loop, it further reduces `min_keg_volume` by \((\text{remaining\_kvass} + n - 1) // n\). Finally, it prints the adjusted `min_keg_volume`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the sum of `v` is less than `s` by printing `-1`.
- The function correctly sorts the list `v` before processing.
- The function correctly updates `min_keg_volume` during the iteration, ensuring it is always the smallest possible value that can accommodate the remaining kvass.
- However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `remaining_kvass` is zero before the loop ends due to elements in `v` being larger than `min_keg_volume`. This means the function may incorrectly reduce `min_keg_volume` even when `remaining_kvass` is zero, which should be a terminal condition for the loop.

After the function concludes, the state of the program will be:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\).
- `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\).
- `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(i\) in range `n`.
- `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list.
- `min_keg_volume` is the smallest possible value that can accommodate the remaining kvass after adjustments.
- `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or the amount of kvass remaining after processing all elements in `volumes` where the volume of the keg is greater than `min_keg_volume` and its current value is greater than 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
