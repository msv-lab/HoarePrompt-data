`positions.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is \(2 \cdot k + 3\)) to the list `positions`. The initial list `positions` contains `[1]`. After appending, the list `positions` will contain `[1, 2 \cdot k + 3]`.

The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n \geq 2 \cdot k + 3\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `positions` is a list containing `[1, 2 \cdot k + 3]`; `i` is \(2 \cdot k + 3\)**
