The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the exact input values are not provided, we can only say that `n` and `k` are assigned the values entered by the user, which are integers within the specified ranges.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000**
