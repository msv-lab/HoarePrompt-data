The list `res` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `l`. The previous value of `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. The output state remains unchanged in terms of the values of `n`, `k`, and `l`, but now there is a new variable `res` which is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000; `l` is equal to `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1); `res` is an empty list**
