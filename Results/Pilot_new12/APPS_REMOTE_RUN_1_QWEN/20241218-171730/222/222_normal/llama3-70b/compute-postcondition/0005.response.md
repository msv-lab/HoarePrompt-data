Let's analyze the given information and determine the necessary adjustments for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n > k + 2\).
- `k` is an integer where \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\).
- `l` is calculated as \(l = \frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1}\) and \(l > 0\).
- `res` is a list containing `[i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1]`.

### Loop:
```python
for i in range(l):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = l - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `l - 1`.

2. **Updating `i`:**
   - In the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `l`.

3. **Checking the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i < l`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `l`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was `l - 1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` must be `l`.

4. **State of Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - `res` is a list and does not change based on the loop variable `i`.

### Conclusion:
To allow the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `l`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n > k + 2\); `k` is an integer where \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `l` is \(\frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1}\) and \(l > 0\); `res` is a list containing `[i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1]`; `i` is `l`**.
