Functionality: **The function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as input where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\). It calculates the value of `l` as \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + k - 1}{k * 2 + 1} \right\rfloor\) and constructs a list `res` containing the first `l` numbers of the form \(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1\) for \(0 \leq i < l\). The function then prints the value of `l` and the elements of `res` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated `l` and `res`. There is no check to ensure \(n > k + 2\), which is stated in the annotation but not in the code, so the code can handle cases where \(n \leq k + 2\).**
