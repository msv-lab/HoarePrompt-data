Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. Specifically, consider the case where \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 1 \). According to the problem description, turning skewer 1 and skewer 4 should achieve the goal, but the program suggests turning skewers 1 and 2. This is incorrect because skewer 2 would remain in its initial state after the first action, and no subsequent action would change its state. Thus, the program fails to provide the correct solution for this case.
