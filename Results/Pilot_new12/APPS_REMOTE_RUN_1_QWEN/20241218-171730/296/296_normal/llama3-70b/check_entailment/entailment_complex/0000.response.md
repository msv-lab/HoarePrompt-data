Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not generate and output a sequence of fractions that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. Instead, it simply outputs a fixed sequence of fractions for any input \( n \geq 3 \), regardless of the actual value of \( n \).

Hereâ€™s why the program does not follow the problem description:

1. **Condition Verification**: The program does not check whether there actually exists a sequence of fractions \(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\) for the given \( n \). The problem statement specifies certain constraints on \( b_i \) and the sum of the fractions. The program does not verify these conditions.

2. **Sequence Generation**: The program generates a fixed sequence of fractions \(\left(1, \frac{n}{2}\right)\) and \(\left(1, n\right)\) for any \( n \geq 3 \). This sequence does not necessarily meet the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}\) for all possible values of \( n \). For example, if \( n = 4 \), the generated sequence would be \(\left(1, 2\right)\) and \(\left(1, 4\right)\), which does not sum to \(1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\).

3. **Output Format**: While the program correctly outputs "YES" for \( n \geq 3 \) and "NO" for \( n = 2 \), it does not generate a valid sequence of fractions that satisfies the given equation. The output format also includes setting \( n \) to 2 at the end, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

To properly solve the problem, the program needs to generate a sequence of fractions that meets the specified conditions for any valid input \( n \). The current implementation does not achieve this.
