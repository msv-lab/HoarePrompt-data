Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from the user. It then checks if `n` is equal to 2. If `n` is 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', sets `k` to 2, and prints `k`, followed by '1' and `n`, and finally sets `n` to 2. The function does not return anything but modifies the value of `n` to 2 if `n` was not 2 initially.**

This summary covers all potential cases:
- If `n` is 2, the function prints 'NO'.
- If `n` is any other value between 2 and \(10^9\), the function prints 'YES', sets `k` to 2, prints `k`, '1' and `n`, and then sets `n` to 2.

There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code that need to be included in the summary.
