The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, returning 'NO' if true. If `n` is greater than 2, it calculates all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) and their corresponding quotients, storing them in the `divisors` list. If the `divisors` list is empty, it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns a string starting with 'YES', followed by the length of the `divisors` list, and then each tuple in the `fractions` list formatted as '1 d' where 'd' is a divisor of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\), along with its corresponding quotient.
