The code assigns the length of the `divisors` list to the variable `k`. Since `divisors` contains all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) along with their corresponding quotients, the length of the list `divisors` is updated to the variable `k`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates; `k` is the length of the `divisors` list.**
