Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop parameters:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - This means the loop will start with `i = 2` and continue as long as `i <= int(math.sqrt(n))`.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one value of `i` within the specified range.
   - The range starts at `2`, so `i` must be able to take values starting from `2` up to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

3. **Consider the value of `n`:**
   - Since `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than `2`, we need to consider the smallest possible value for `n` to check if the loop can execute.
   - The smallest value of `n` is `3` (since `n > 2`).

4. **Calculate the square root of the smallest `n`:**
   - For `n = 3`, \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\).
   - Therefore, `int(math.sqrt(3)) = 1`.

5. **Check the range condition:**
   - The loop will iterate from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - For `n = 3`, the range is from `2` to `2` (since `int(math.sqrt(3)) + 1 = 2`).
   - Hence, the loop will execute once when `i = 2`.

6. **Adjust the states:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start with `i = 2` and continue as long as `i <= int(math.sqrt(n))`.
   - This implies that `n` should be large enough so that `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least `1` (which is already true since `n >= 3`).

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

- `n` should be a positive integer greater than `2`.
- `divisors` should be an empty list.

However, the key condition here is ensuring that the loop can start and continue, which means `n` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least `1`.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is an empty list, and `i` starts at 2 and increases until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**
