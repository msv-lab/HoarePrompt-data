Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, and if `i` (which is `k + 1`) is a divisor of `n`, then `n // i` is added to the list `divisors` if it is not already present.***
