The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
- `n` is greater than 2
- `divisors` is an empty list
- `i` starts at 2 and increases until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`
- The current value of `i` satisfies `n % i == 0`

When `divisors.append(i)` is executed, `i` is added to the list `divisors`. Since `i` is a divisor of `n`, this means `n` is divisible by `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is a list containing `i`, `i` is a divisor of `n`, `i` starts at 2 and increases until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**
