Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor + 1\) along with their corresponding quotients, and if `i` is not equal to `n // i`, then `n // i` is added to the list `divisors`. `i` is `k + 1`.***
