Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and \(n > 2\); `divisors` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) along with their corresponding quotients, ensuring no duplicates.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all integers `i` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\).
- For each `i` where `n % i == 0`, both `i` and `n // i` are added to the list `divisors`.
- Since the loop checks up to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\), all divisors of `n` within this range and their corresponding quotients are included in `divisors`.
- To ensure no duplicates, the condition `if i != n // i` ensures that each pair `(i, n // i)` is only added once.

Thus, after the loop completes, `divisors` will contain all unique divisors of `n` from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) along with their corresponding quotients.
