Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case when \( n \) is a prime number correctly. As per the problem description, for prime numbers, we can still construct a sequence of fractions that satisfy the conditions. For example, for \( n = 5 \), a valid sequence could be \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{10} = 1 - \frac{1}{5}\). However, the current implementation only considers divisors up to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) and does not account for constructing valid sequences for prime numbers. This oversight leads to incorrect outputs for prime inputs, making the program incorrect overall.
