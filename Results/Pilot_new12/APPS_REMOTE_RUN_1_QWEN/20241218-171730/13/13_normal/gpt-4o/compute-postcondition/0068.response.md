The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and `trophies`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.

The function returns:
- Case_1: `0`
- Case_2: The maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string
- Case_3: The minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, and return either 0, the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, or the minimum value between this maximum length plus one and `n`.
