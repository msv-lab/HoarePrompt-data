Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `segments`.
   - `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `segments`.
   - `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.
   - `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition `for i in range(1, len(segments))` means that the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `len(segments) - 1`.

3. **Understand the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body checks if `curr_start - prev_end == 2`.
   - If the condition is true, it updates `max_length` to the maximum value between its current value and `(curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)`.
   - If the condition is false, the values of `max_length`, `prev_start`, `prev_end`, `curr_start`, and `curr_end` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` at each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `prev_start` will now be the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.
   - `prev_end` will be the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.
   - `curr_start` will be the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`.
   - `curr_end` will be the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`.

5. **Formulate the New States:**
   - The new state for the next iteration will be:
     - `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.
     - `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.
     - `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`.
     - `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`.

Given the above steps, the answer is:

State: **`prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `segments`.**
