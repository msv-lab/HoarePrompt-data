Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'. `segments` is either an empty list or a list containing at least one element which is the sublist ['G'] and now includes the tuple (1, n), depending on whether `trophies[i]` is 'G'. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', `i` is `n + 1` and `start` is 1. If `trophies[i]` is not 'G', `i` is 1.***
