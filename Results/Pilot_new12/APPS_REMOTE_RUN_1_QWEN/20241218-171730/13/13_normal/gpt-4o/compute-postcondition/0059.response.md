The code snippet updates the value of `max_length` based on the current segment and the previous segment in the `segments` tuple list. Specifically, it calculates the length of a potential new segment by adding the lengths of the current segment and the previous segment, plus one additional unit.

Given the initial state:
- `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`.
- `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`.
- `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.
- `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.

The code updates `max_length` as follows:
- `curr_end - curr_start + 1` gives the length of the current segment.
- `prev_end - prev_start + 1` gives the length of the previous segment.
- Adding 1 accounts for an additional unit to be considered in the calculation.

Therefore, `max_length` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the sum of the lengths of the current and previous segments plus 1.

Output State: **`max_length` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and (curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1), `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`, `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`.**
