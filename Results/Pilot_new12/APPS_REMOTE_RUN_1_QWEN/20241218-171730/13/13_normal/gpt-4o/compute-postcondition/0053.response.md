Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in the `trophies` string, `start` is the starting index of the last segment of 'G's found, `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `len(segments)` must be greater than 1, `prev_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `prev_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i - 1` in `segments`, `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`, `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `segments`. The current value of `curr_start` is 2 more than the current value of `prev_end`**.
