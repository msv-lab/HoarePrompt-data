Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` must be greater than 2
  - `trophies[2]` is 'G'
  - `i` is increased by 1

- **While Loop Condition:**
  ```
  while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
     - `i < n`
     - `trophies[i] == 'G'`

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2 (so far)
   - `trophies[2]` is 'G'
   - `i` has been incremented from its previous value (let's assume it was 2, making it 3 now)

3. **Check Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is now 3, we check `i < n`: This is true as long as `n` is greater than 3.
   - We also need to check `trophies[i] == 'G'`: For `i = 3`, we need to know the value of `trophies[3]`.

4. **Determine Next Iteration State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still satisfy `i < n`.
   - Additionally, `trophies[i]` must be 'G' when `i` is incremented again.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `trophies[3]` must be 'G' for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion
The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `trophies[3]` must be 'G'

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `trophies[3]` must be 'G'**
