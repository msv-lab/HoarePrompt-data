`beauty` is incremented by 1 based on the condition that `s[j]` is 'G'. Since the condition for incrementing `beauty` is not met (as it was already incremented by 1 in the given line of code without any conditional check), `beauty` remains unchanged from its previous value. The other variables (`j`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`j` is `i + 4`, `beauty` remains unchanged, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged.**
