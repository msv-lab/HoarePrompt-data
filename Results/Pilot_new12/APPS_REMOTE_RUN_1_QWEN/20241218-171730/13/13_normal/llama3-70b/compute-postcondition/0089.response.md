The code snippet updates `max_beauty_one_swap` with the value of `max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)`. Given that `beauty` represents the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`, and considering `max_beauty_one_swap` is initialized to 0, this operation will set `max_beauty_one_swap` to `beauty` if `beauty` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains 0.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_beauty_one_swap` has been updated to the value of `beauty`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `n`, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `beauty` if `beauty` > 0, else 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.**
