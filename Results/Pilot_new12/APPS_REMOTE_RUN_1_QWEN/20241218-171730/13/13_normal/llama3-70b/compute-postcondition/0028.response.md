`left` is incremented by 1. The initial state shows that `left` is 0, so after the increment, `left` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S' and `s[0]` is not 'G', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is 1, `right` is 1, and `curr_beauty` is 0**
