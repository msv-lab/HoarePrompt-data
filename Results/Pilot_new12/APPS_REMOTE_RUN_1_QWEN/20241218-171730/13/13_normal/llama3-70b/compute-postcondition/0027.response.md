Let's analyze the given `while` loop step by step:

The loop condition is:
```python
while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S'
- `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`
- `left` is 0
- `right` is 1
- `curr_beauty` is 0

For the loop to execute at least one iteration, the following conditions must be met:
1. `left < right`: This condition is initially true since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1.
2. `s[left] != 'G'`: This condition must be true for the loop to execute. Given `left` is 0, we need `s[0] != 'G'`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `s[0]` is not 'G'.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S' and `s[0]` is not 'G'
- `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`
- `left` is 0
- `right` is 1
- `curr_beauty` is 0

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S' and `s[0]` is not 'G', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, and `curr_beauty` is 0**
