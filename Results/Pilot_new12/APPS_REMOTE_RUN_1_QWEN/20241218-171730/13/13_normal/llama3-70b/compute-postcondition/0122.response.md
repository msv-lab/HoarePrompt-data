Output State: **`j` is either `i + 2` (if the loop did not execute) or the position just after the last consecutive 'G' in the string starting from index `i + 1`, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character, incremented by 1 for each 'G' encountered within the range, and unchanged otherwise. `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `golden` remain unchanged.**
