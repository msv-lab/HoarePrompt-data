The code snippet updates the `max_beauty` variable by taking the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `left`, or `right`. Therefore, the `max_beauty` variable is updated, but its exact value depends on the previous values of `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 1; `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.**
