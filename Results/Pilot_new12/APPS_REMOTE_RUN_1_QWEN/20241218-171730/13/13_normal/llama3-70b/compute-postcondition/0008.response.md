`curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. Since the character at index `right` in `s` is 'G', `curr_beauty` was contributing to the count of consecutive 'G's ending at `right`. Therefore, `curr_beauty` is now one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1 more than its previous value, `left` is 0, `right` is 0. The character at index `right` in `s` is 'G'.**
