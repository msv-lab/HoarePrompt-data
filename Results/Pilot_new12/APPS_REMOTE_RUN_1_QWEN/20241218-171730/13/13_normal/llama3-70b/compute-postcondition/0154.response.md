The code `break` does not change any variable values but breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no loop or switch-case structure in the given initial state, the execution of `break` does not affect any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is `i + 4`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 4`.**
