`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The second line of input is a string consisting of `n` characters, each of which is either 'G' or 'S'. This string is not assigned to any variable in the given code snippet, so its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the second line of input is a string consisting of n characters, each of which is either 'G' or 'S'**
