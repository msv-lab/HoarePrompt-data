Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `i` is a non-negative integer.
- `s` is a string.
- `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, and `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring or -1 if no 'G' character is found.
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts iterating over values of `j` starting from `i + 2`.
   - Therefore, `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to start executing.

2. **Variable `j`:**
   - During the first iteration, `j` will be set to `i + 2`.
   - For subsequent iterations, `j` will increment by 1 until it reaches `n`.
   - Hence, `j` should be able to take values starting from `i + 2` up to `n - 1`.

3. **Variable `n`:**
   - Since `j` must start from `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

4. **Variables `s`, `beauty`, and `j`:**
   - These variables are already defined and do not directly affect the loop condition. However, they provide context about the initial conditions and behavior of the loop.

### Adjusted States:
Based on the above analysis, we need to ensure that:
- `i + 2` is less than or equal to `n` (i.e., `i + 1 < n`).

Thus, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring or -1 if no 'G' character is found, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
