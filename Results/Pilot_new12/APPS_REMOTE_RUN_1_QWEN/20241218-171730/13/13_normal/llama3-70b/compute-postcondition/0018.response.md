Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of integers containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G', `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is equal to `right`, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and `s[right]` is not 'G'.** 

This is because the loop continues to increment `left` until `left` equals `right` or `s[left]` becomes 'G'. Since `s[right]` is not 'G' and `left` increments until it equals `right`, the loop terminates when `left` and `right` are equal, and `s[right]` remains not 'G'. Given the conditions of the loop, this is the final state after the loop has completed all iterations.
