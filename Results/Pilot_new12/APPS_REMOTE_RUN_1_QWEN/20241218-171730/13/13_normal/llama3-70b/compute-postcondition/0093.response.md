Let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `i` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is initially set to `n`.
- `beauty` is 1.
- `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's.
- `right` is `n`.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is `beauty` if `beauty` > 0, else 0.
- `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop runs as long as `j` is in the range from `i - 1` down to `-1`. This means `j` must start from a value less than or equal to `i - 1` and go down to `-1`.

2. **Initial Value of `j`**: According to the provided information, `j` is initially set to `n`. To ensure the loop starts, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`.

3. **Range Parameters**:
   - The start of the range is `i - 1`.
   - The stop of the range is `-1`.
   - The step is `-1`, indicating a decrement.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop can start, `j` (which is `n`) must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`.
   - Since `j` is `n` initially, we need to ensure `n >= i - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 1`**
