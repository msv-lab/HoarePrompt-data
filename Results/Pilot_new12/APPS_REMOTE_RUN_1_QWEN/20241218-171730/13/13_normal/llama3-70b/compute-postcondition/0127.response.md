To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:

1. `i` is a non-negative integer.
2. `j` is determined based on the condition `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'`:
   - If the condition is false, `j` is `i + 3`.
   - If the condition is true, `j` is the position just after the last consecutive 'G' in the string starting from index `i + 2`.
3. `beauty` is 1.
4. `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `golden` remain unchanged.
5. `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its original value and `beauty`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i - 1` to `-1` in reverse order.
   - For the loop to start, `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, meaning `i` must be at least 1.

2. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over values of `j` starting from `i - 1` down to 0.
   - Each value of `j` must be a valid index within the string `s`.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `beauty` is 1, which is fixed.
   - `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `golden` are unchanged and do not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is set as the maximum of its original value and `beauty`, which is 1.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `i` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.
   - `s` (the string) must have at least `i - 1` characters to ensure all indices from `i - 1` to 0 are valid.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, we need to adjust the following states:
- `i` must be at least 1.
- The string `s` must have at least `i - 1` characters.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`i` is at least 1, `s` is a string with at least `i - 1` characters**
