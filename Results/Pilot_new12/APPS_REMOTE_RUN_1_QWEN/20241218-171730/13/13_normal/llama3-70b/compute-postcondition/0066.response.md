`beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `beauty` is initially 1 if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', and 0 otherwise, after incrementing by 1, `beauty` will be 2 if the character is 'G', and 1 if the character is not 'G'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is -1, if the character at index `-1` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2, otherwise `beauty` is 1.**
