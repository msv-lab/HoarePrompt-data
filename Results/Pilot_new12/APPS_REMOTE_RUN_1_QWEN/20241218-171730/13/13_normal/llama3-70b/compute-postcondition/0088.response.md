Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `n`, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs until `j` reaches `n`. For each iteration, if `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` increments by 1 and the index `j` is added to the list `golden`. Once `j` reaches `n` or `s[j]` is not 'G', the loop terminates.
- After the loop completes, `i` will remain its original value (1), `j` will be `n`, and `beauty` will be the count of consecutive 'G's from `i-1` to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s`.
- `left` will be the index of the last 'G' encountered during the loop, or `n` if no 'G' was found.
- `right` will remain `n` since it is not updated within the loop.
- `max_beauty` will be the maximum value between its current value and `curr_beauty`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each consecutive 'G'.
- `curr_beauty` will be 0 after the loop as it is not updated further.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` will remain 0 as it is not updated within the loop.
- `golden` will remain a list of all indices of 'G's in the string `s` as it is not modified further in the loop.
