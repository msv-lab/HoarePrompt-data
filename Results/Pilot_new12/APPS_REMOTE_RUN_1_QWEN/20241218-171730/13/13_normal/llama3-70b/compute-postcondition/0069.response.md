According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop iterates over the range from `i - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is -1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the condition under which the loop would continue. The loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than -1.

Since `j` is currently -1, it is equal to -1, which means the loop will not execute again because the condition `j > -1` is no longer satisfied.

However, to provide the state as requested, we need to reflect the current values of the variables at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is -1**
