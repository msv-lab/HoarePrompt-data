Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is either `i + 2` if the condition `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'` is false, or the position just after the last consecutive 'G' in the string starting from index `i + 1` if the condition is true.
- `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character, incremented by 1 for each 'G' encountered within the range, and unchanged otherwise.
- `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `golden` remain unchanged.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its original value and `beauty`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive).
- Each iteration of the loop updates the values of `i`, `j`, `beauty`, and potentially `max_beauty_one_swap`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States:
1. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - The loop iterates through the indices from `0` to `n-2`.
   - Therefore, if the current `i` is at index `k`, the next iteration will set `i` to `k + 1`.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - The value of `j` depends on the value of `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]`.
   - If `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'`, then `j = i + 2`.
   - Otherwise, `j` is set to the position just after the last consecutive 'G' starting from `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `beauty`:**
   - `beauty` is updated based on the characters between `i - 1` and `j`.
   - Specifically, `beauty` is incremented by 1 for each 'G' encountered within this range.

4. **Other Variables (`left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `golden`):**
   - These variables remain unchanged during each iteration.

### Final Adjusted State:
- The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The value of `j` will be determined as per the condition described.
- The value of `beauty` will be updated based on the new range of characters from `i - 1` to `j`.
- The other variables (`left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `golden`) remain unchanged.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` will be updated to the maximum of its original value and the new `beauty`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is either `i + 3` if the condition `s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S'` is false, or the position just after the last consecutive 'G' in the string starting from index `i + 2` if the condition is true, `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` to the first non-'G' character in the range from `i + 1` to `j`, incremented by 1 for each 'G' encountered within this range, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `golden` remain unchanged, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its original value and `beauty`**.
