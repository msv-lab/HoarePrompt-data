The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, it simply ends the execution of this line without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from index 0 to the first 'S' or the end of the string `s` + 1, `left` is the index of the last 'G' in the string `s`, or `n` if there are no 'G's, `right` is `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `golden` is a list of indices of all characters in `s` that are equal to 'G'.**
