The code `break` does not affect any variable values directly; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or switch-case statement. Since there is no loop or switch-case statement in the given initial state, the `break` statement here would simply end the execution of whatever control structure it was within, but since no such structure is mentioned, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string, `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and going backwards until the first non-'G' character is encountered, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found in this substring or -1 if no 'G' character is found, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. The character at index `j` of string `s` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
