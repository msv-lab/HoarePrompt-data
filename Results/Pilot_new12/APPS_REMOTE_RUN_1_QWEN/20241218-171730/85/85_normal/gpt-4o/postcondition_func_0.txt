The function reads an integer \( n \) from the user where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). It then counts the number of trailing 9s in \( n \), removes those trailing 9s, and calculates a value based on the remaining part of \( n \) and the count of trailing 9s. Specifically, it computes the product of the remaining part of \( n \) plus one and the count of trailing 9s. Finally, it prints this computed value. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value explicitly; however, the printed value can be considered its output.
