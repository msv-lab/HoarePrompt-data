Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The code attempts to count the number of trailing 9s in \( n \) and then calculates a value based on the remaining part of \( n \) and the count of trailing 9s. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly determine the pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

To illustrate why the code is incorrect, consider the following example:

- For \( n = 50 \), the correct output should be 1 because the only pair that satisfies the condition is (49, 50), whose total cost is 99 (two nines).
- However, the provided code would incorrectly calculate the number of pairs. It would count the number of trailing 9s in 50, which is 0, and then compute the value as \( (50 + 1) \times 0 = 0 \). This is incorrect because it does not consider the actual pairs whose total cost ends with the maximum number of nines.

The correct approach involves finding the largest number \( k \) such that \( 10^k \leq n \), and then determining the pairs of shovels that satisfy the condition. The provided code fails to implement this logic correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
