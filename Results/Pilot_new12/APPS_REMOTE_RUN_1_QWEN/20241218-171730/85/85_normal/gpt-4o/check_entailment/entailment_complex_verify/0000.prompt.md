You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        n //= 10
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to calculate the number of pairs of shovels whose total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines, but it fails to consider all cases correctly.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program calculates `max_9s` as the number of trailing zeros in `(n + 1)`.
2. It then calculates the number of valid pairs as `(n + 1) * max_9s`.

However, this logic has a flaw. Consider the case where `n = 50`. According to the problem statement, the maximum number of trailing nines in the sum of any two shovels' costs should be calculated. The correct approach would be to find pairs such that their sum ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

For `n = 50`, the maximum number of trailing nines in the sum of any two shovels' costs is 2 (for the pair (49, 50)). The program, however, calculates `(50 + 1) * 1 = 51`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Find the largest `k` such that `10^k <= n`.
2. For each `i` from `1` to `k`, calculate the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` ends with `99...9` (k nines).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    k = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        k += 1
        n //= 10
    
    result = 0
    for i in range(k + 1):
        max_a = min(n, 10**i - 1)
        min_b = 10**i - (n - max_a)
        result += max(0, min_b - max_a + 1)
    
    print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the integer obtained by successively removing the last digit of the original `n` until the last digit is not 9, `max_9s` is the count of how many times the last digit was 9 before it stopped being 9
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) from the user where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). It then counts the number of trailing 9s in \( n \), removes those trailing 9s, and calculates a value based on the remaining part of \( n \) and the count of trailing 9s. Specifically, it computes the product of the remaining part of \( n \) plus one and the count of trailing 9s. Finally, it prints this computed value. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value explicitly; however, the printed value can be considered its output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
