The initial state is defined such that `n` is an integer obtained by successively removing the last digit of the original `n` until the last digit is not 9, and `max_9s` is the count of how many times the last digit was 9 before it stopped being 9.

The code snippet is:
```python
pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `n`.
2. The value of `max_9s` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `max_9s`.
3. A new variable `pairs` is created and assigned the value of `(n + 1) * max_9s`.

Since the values of `n` and `max_9s` remain the same, the only new information introduced is the value of `pairs`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer obtained by successively removing the last digit of the original `n` until the last digit is not 9, `max_9s` is the count of how many times the last digit was 9 before it stopped being 9, `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s`.**
