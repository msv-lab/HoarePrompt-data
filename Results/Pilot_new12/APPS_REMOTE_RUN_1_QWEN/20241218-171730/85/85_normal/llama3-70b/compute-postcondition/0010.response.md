`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is not specified, but since no initial value is given and the operation is addition, we assume `ans` was previously 0 (common in such cases if not stated otherwise). Therefore, after `ans += 1`, `ans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `ans` is 1**
