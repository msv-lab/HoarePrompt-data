According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n // 2 + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be at least 2.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. The current value of `i` is 2.
2. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2 + 1`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
4. Since `i` starts from 1, the condition for the next iteration to occur is that `i` should be 3 and still within the bounds defined by `n`.

Given that `n` must be at least 2, and `i` must be 3 for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n // 2 + 1` is still greater than or equal to 3.

Let's check the condition:
- If `i` is 2, then `n // 2 + 1` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.
- This means `n // 2` must be at least 2, hence `n` must be at least 4 (since 4 // 2 = 2).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 3**
