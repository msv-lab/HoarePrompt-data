Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of products that can be sold by doubling the number of products available for sale on selected days. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input correctly, splitting the data into the required variables `n` and `f`, and storing the pairs `(k_i, l_i)` in a list called `days`.

2. **Calculating Regular Sales**: For each day, it calculates the number of products sold without any sell-out (`min(k, l)`), which is stored in the list `regular_sales`.

3. **Calculating Potential Increase in Sales**: It also calculates the potential increase in sales if the day is chosen for a sell-out (`min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`), which is stored in the list `potential_sales_increase`.

4. **Summing Up Sales**: The program sums up the regular sales and adds the potential increase in sales for the `f` days with the highest potential increase, ensuring the maximum number of products sold.

This approach ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
