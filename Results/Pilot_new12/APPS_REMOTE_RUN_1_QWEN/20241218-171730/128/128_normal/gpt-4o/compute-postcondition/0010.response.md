The code appends a new element to the `potential_sales_increase` list, which is calculated as `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `k` and `l`, we know that the new element in `potential_sales_increase` will be this expression. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is \(f - 2\), `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list with an appended element which is the minimum of `k` and `l`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list with two appended elements, the first being the minimum of `k` and `l`, and the second being `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`.**
