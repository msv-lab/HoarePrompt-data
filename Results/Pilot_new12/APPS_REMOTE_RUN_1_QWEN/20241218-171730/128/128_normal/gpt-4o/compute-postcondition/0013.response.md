The code `potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the `potential_sales_increase` list in descending order. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `f`, `days`, `regular_sales`, or `total_sales`. It only changes the order of the elements in `potential_sales_increase`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is \(f - n\), `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list with `n` elements, each being the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` from the corresponding tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list with `n` elements, each being \(min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)\) from the corresponding tuple in `days`, sorted in descending order, `total_sales` is the sum of elements in `regular_sales`.**
