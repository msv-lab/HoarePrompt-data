Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `f` is \(f - 1\) (This indicates `f` has been decremented by 1)
- `days` is a list of `n` tuples
- `regular_sales` is a list with an appended element which is the minimum of undefined variables `k` and `l`
- `potential_sales_increase` is a list with an appended element equal to `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`

### For Loop Statement:
```
for (k, l) in days:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(k, l)` in the `days` list. The loop condition is that `i < n`, where `i` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

2. **Current Values**:
   - `n` remains unchanged (still within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)).
   - `f` has been decremented by 1.
   - `days` is a list of `n` tuples, and each tuple `(k, l)` is being processed in the loop.
   - `regular_sales` has an appended element, which is the minimum of `k` and `l`.
   - `potential_sales_increase` has an appended element, which is `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, for the next iteration to occur, `i` must still be less than `n`. This means that we are processing the next tuple in the `days` list.
   - The appended elements in `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase` lists will update based on the current tuple `(k, l)`.

### Updated State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `f` has been decremented by another 1, making it `f - 2`.
- `days` is a list of `n` tuples, and the loop is about to process the next tuple `(k, l)`.
- `regular_sales` will have another appended element, which is the minimum of the new `k` and `l`.
- `potential_sales_increase` will have another appended element, which is `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is \(f - 2\), `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list with an appended element which is the minimum of the new `k` and `l`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list with an appended element equal to `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`**.
