The code `total_sales = sum(regular_sales)` calculates the sum of the elements in the `regular_sales` list and assigns it to `total_sales`. This means that `total_sales` now holds the sum of all values in `regular_sales`. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `days`, `regular_sales`, and `potential_sales_increase`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is \(f - n\), `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list with `n` elements, each being the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` from the corresponding tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list with `n` elements, each being \(min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)\) from the corresponding tuple in `days`, `total_sales` is the sum of elements in `regular_sales`.**
