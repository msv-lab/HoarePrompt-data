`k` and `l` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n`, `days`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial state also includes that `k` and `l` are input integers.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `days` is now a list containing the tuple `(k, l)`, `f` must be within the range 0 to `n` inclusive, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `k` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `l` is assigned the value of the second input integer**
