Postcondition: ***`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is an integer within the range 0 to `n` inclusive, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple consists of two integers `k` and `l` where 0 ≤ `k`, `l` ≤ 10^9, the list `days` is sorted based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple in descending order; `sold` is `min(days[0][0], days[0][1]) + min(days[2][0], days[2][1]).***
