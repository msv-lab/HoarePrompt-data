#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and f are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ f ≤ n. For each i in range(n), k_{i} and l_{i} are integers such that 0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9, representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients coming to the shop on the i-th day, respectively.
def func():
    n, f = map(int, input().split())
    days = []
    for _ in range(n):
        k, l = map(int, input().split())
        
        days.append((k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is an integer within the range 0 to `n` inclusive, `days` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple consists of two integers `k` and `l` where 0 ≤ `k`, `l` ≤ 10^9, the loop executes exactly `n` times.
    days.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
    sold = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i < f:
            sold += min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])
        else:
            sold += min(days[i][0], days[i][1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is an integer within the range 0 to `n` inclusive, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple consists of two integers `k` and `l` where \(0 \leq k, l \leq 10^9\), and the list `days` is sorted based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple in descending order; `sold` is the sum of the minimum values calculated for each tuple in the list according to the rules defined inside the loop.
    print(sold)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of days represented by pairs of integers (k_i, l_i), where k_i is the number of products available and l_i is the number of clients arriving on the i-th day. It sorts these days based on the difference between the number of clients and products in descending order. Then, it calculates the total number of products sold over all days, with the first f days having each product sold twice before moving to the regular sale rate. The function prints the total number of products sold. There are no return values, so the final state of the program after the function concludes is that the total number of products sold is printed to the console. Potential edge cases include when f is 0 (only regular sale rate is applied) or when f equals n (all products are sold at double the rate).
