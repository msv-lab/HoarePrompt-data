The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, which consists of four lines, where each line contains one integer \( cnt_i \) (\( 0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9 \)) representing the count of strings "(((、“)), “()”, and “)(" respectively. Based on these inputs, the function returns a specific value, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read four integers from the user, each representing counts of different string patterns, and then return a value based on these counts. However, since the exact return value is not specified, we can only describe the input process.

Functionality: **The function reads four integers from the user, each representing counts of different string patterns, and returns a value based on these counts.**
