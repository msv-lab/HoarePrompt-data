Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program only checks if swapping the empty cells once results in the same sorted configuration, which is not sufficient to determine if the puzzles can be made identical through a series of valid moves. The program fails to simulate the actual sliding of tiles, which is essential for determining if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` only considers a single swap scenario and does not explore all possible sequences of moves, thus leading to incorrect conclusions in many cases. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
