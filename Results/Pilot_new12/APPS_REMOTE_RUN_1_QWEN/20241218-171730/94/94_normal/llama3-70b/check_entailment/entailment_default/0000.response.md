Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the sliding puzzle logic. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the two puzzles can be made identical by swapping the contents of the empty cell, which is not sufficient to determine if they can reach the same configuration through a series of valid moves. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
AB
XC
CB
AX

Output:
YES
```

However, the correct output should be "NO" because there is no sequence of valid moves that can transform the first puzzle (`AB\nXC`) into the second puzzle (`CB\nAX`). The current implementation fails to account for the valid sliding moves and simply checks for equality after a single swap operation. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
