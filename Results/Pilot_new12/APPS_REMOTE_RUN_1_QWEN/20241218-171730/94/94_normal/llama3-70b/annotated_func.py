#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are strings consisting of four characters each, where each character is either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X'. The string represents a 2x2 grid of a sliding puzzle, with 'A', 'B', and 'C' representing tiles and 'X' representing the empty cell. Both puzzles guarantee that they have exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` is a string of four characters, `puzzle2` is a string of four characters, `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True if sorting the characters of 'puzzle1' and 'puzzle2' results in the same sequence, otherwise False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, which are strings representing 2x2 grids of a sliding puzzle. It first identifies the index of the empty cell ('X') in both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Then, it swaps the contents of the cells at these indices between the two puzzles. Finally, it checks if sorting the characters of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` results in the same sequence. If they do, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function covers the case where both puzzles initially have the same configuration (including the empty cell), and it correctly handles the swap operation. However, it does not account for the scenario where the puzzles are identical but not initially swapped, in which case the function would still return `False` due to the sorting step.
