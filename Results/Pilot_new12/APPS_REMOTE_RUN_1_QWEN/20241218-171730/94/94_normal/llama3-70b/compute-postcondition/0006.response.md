Postcondition: ***`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are strings of four characters each, containing exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `x1` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`; `x2` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`; if `puzzle2[i]` equals 'X', then `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`; otherwise, `x2` remains unchanged.***
