Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `puzzle1` is a string of four characters.
   - `puzzle2` is a string of four characters.
   - `x2` is equal to the value of `i`.
   - `x1` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`.
   - If `puzzle2[i]` is 'X', then `x2` is equal to the value of `i`. Otherwise, the value of `x2` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(4)`, meaning it will run 4 times (from `i = 0` to `i = 3`).

3. **State After Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration based on the information given after the previous iteration.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, if we are at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than its current value in the next iteration.
   - For example, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will be 4 in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust States**:
   - `x2` will be updated to the value of `i` for each iteration, so if `i` is 4, `x2` will be 4.
   - `x1` remains unchanged as it is determined by the initial position of 'X' in `puzzle1` and does not change within the loop.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration when `i` is 4 would be:

- `puzzle1` remains the same.
- `puzzle2` remains the same.
- `x1` remains the same as it was determined in the initial state.
- `x2` is now equal to 4 because `i` is 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`puzzle1` is a string of four characters, `puzzle2` is a string of four characters, `x1` is equal to the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, `x2` is 4**
