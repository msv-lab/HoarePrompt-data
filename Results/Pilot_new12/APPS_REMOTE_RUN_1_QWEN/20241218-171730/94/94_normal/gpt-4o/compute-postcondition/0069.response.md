The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list from the `current` list and assigns it to the variable `new_state`. This means that `new_state` now contains the same elements as `current`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state_str` remains consistent, `new_row` remains `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` remains `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` remains `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `directions` remains consistent, `new_state` is a list identical to `current`, `visited` remains consistent.**
