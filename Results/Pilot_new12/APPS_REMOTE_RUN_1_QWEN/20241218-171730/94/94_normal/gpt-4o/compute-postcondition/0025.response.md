`visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. The values of `new_state_str`, `new_state`, `queue`, `visited`, `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the swapped elements in `new_state`; `new_state` now has the swapped elements; `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected; `current` remains unchanged; `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged; `visited` includes the string `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`new_state_str` is the string created by joining the swapped elements in `new_state`; `new_state` now has the swapped elements; `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected; `current` remains unchanged; `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged; `visited` includes the string `new_state_str`**
