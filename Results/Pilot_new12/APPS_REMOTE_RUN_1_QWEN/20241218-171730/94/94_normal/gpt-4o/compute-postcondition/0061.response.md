The code `''.join(new_state)` concatenates the elements of the list `new_state` into a single string without any separators. Since `new_state` is a copy of the list `current` with elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, this operation does not change the elements themselves, only combines them into a string.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements where `new_state_str` is now a string created by concatenating the elements of `new_state`, `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_state` is a copy of the list `current` with elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
