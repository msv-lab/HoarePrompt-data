`current` is assigned the value of the element at the front of `queue` using `popleft()`. This removes the element from `queue`. The values of `visited` and `directions` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle; `queue` does not contain `start`; `visited` contains `start`; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the value that was at the front of `queue` before it was removed.**
