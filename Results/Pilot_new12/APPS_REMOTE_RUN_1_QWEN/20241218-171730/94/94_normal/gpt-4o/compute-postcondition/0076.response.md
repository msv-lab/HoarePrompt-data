Output State: **`queue` is a list containing all unique states reachable from `start` through valid moves, `visited` is a set containing all unique states reachable from `start` through valid moves, `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is the leftmost element of the updated `queue`, `empty_row`, `empty_col` are determined by `divmod(empty_pos, 2)` where `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, and `queue` is non-empty as long as there are still unique states to explore.**

### Explanation:
- **Queue (`queue`)**: The loop continues to execute until all possible unique states reachable from the initial configuration `start` have been explored. Each time the loop runs, it checks potential new states by moving the empty space in the 2x2 puzzle. If the new state is not already in `visited`, it gets added to both `visited` and `queue`. This process ensures that `queue` eventually contains all possible unique states reachable from `start`.
  
- **Visited (`visited`)**: Since each new state is added to `visited` when it is first encountered, `visited` ends up containing all unique states reachable from `start` through valid moves.

- **Directions (`directions`)**: The `directions` list remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop, as it only specifies the possible moves for the empty space in the puzzle.

- **Current (`current`)**: `current` is the leftmost element of the updated `queue` after each iteration. As the loop progresses, `current` reflects the most recently discovered unique state that can still lead to further exploration.

- **Empty Position (`empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`)**: These variables track the position of the empty space in the current state. They are determined by the position of 'X' in the current puzzle configuration, and they change as the empty space is moved according to the valid moves specified in `directions`.

- **Queue Non-emptiness**: The loop continues as long as there are still unique states to explore, ensuring that `queue` is non-empty as long as the puzzle configuration allows for further moves.
