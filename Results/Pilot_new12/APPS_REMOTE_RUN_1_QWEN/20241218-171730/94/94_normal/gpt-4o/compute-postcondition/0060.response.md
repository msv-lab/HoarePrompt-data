The code swaps the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. Given the initial state, the values of `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are known to be either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and the elements at these positions are swapped.

Let's denote the initial state of `new_state` as follows:
- `new_state = [A, B, C, D]` where A, B, C, and D are the elements in the list, and `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are indices 0, 1, 2, or 3.

After the swap, the new state of `new_state` will be:
- If `empty_pos` is 0 and `new_pos` is 1, then `new_state` becomes `[B, A, C, D]`.
- If `empty_pos` is 0 and `new_pos` is 2, then `new_state` becomes `[C, B, A, D]`.
- If `empty_pos` is 0 and `new_pos` is 3, then `new_state` becomes `[D, B, C, A]`.
- If `empty_pos` is 1 and `new_pos` is 0, then `new_state` becomes `[B, A, C, D]` (same as above because swapping back to original position).
- If `empty_pos` is 1 and `new_pos` is 2, then `new_state` becomes `[A, C, B, D]`.
- If `empty_pos` is 1 and `new_pos` is 3, then `new_state` becomes `[A, D, C, B]`.
- If `empty_pos` is 2 and `new_pos` is 0, then `new_state` becomes `[C, B, A, D]` (same as above).
- If `empty_pos` is 2 and `new_pos` is 1, then `new_state` becomes `[A, C, B, D]`.
- If `empty_pos` is 2 and `new_pos` is 3, then `new_state` becomes `[A, B, D, C]`.
- If `empty_pos` is 3 and `new_pos` is 0, then `new_state` becomes `[D, B, C, A]` (same as above).
- If `empty_pos` is 3 and `new_pos` is 1, then `new_state` becomes `[A, D, C, B]` (same as above).
- If `empty_pos` is 3 and `new_pos` is 2, then `new_state` becomes `[A, B, D, C]`.

Given that `new_state` is a copy of `current`, and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, and `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1, these conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements where `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `new_row` and `new_col` are either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `directions` remains unchanged as [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_state` is a copy of the list `current` with elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
