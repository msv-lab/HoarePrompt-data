The code swaps the values at `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`
   - `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`
   - `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`
   - `directions` is a non-empty list
   - `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position
   - `new_pos` is recalculated for each direction
   - `new_state` is updated to be a list representation of `current`
   - `new_state_str` is updated
   - `visited` either includes the new state or remains unchanged
   - `queue` either includes the new state or remains unchanged

2. **Code Execution Impact:**
   - `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.

Given the above, the output state will be:

- `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`
- `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`
- `directions` is a non-empty list
- `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position
- `new_pos` is recalculated for each direction
- `new_state` is updated to be a list representation of `current`
- `new_state_str` is updated
- `visited` either includes the new state or remains unchanged
- `queue` either includes the new state or remains unchanged
- `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped

Output State: **`new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is recalculated for each direction; `new_state` is updated to be a list representation of `current`; `new_state_str` is updated; `visited` either includes the new state or remains unchanged; `queue` either includes the new state or remains unchanged; `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.**
