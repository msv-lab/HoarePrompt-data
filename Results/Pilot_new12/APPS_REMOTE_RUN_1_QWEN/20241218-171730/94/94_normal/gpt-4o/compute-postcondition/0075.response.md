Postcondition: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing its original elements. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` is extended by adding `new_state_str`. `new_row` remains `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` remains `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` remains `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state` (which is `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped), `directions` remains consistent, `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `visited` either remains consistent or includes the new state represented by `new_state_str`.**
