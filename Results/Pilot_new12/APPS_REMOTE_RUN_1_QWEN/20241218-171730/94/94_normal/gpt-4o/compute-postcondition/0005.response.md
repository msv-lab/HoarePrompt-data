The code `empty_pos = current.index('X')` finds the position of the empty space ('X') in the `current` configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle. The position is returned as an index, which is assigned to the variable `empty_pos`. 

Given the initial state:
- `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle.
- `queue` does not contain `start`.
- `visited` contains `start`.
- `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.
- `current` is the value that was at the front of `queue` before it was removed.

After executing the code, `empty_pos` will store the index of the 'X' in `current`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle; `queue` does not contain `start`; `visited` contains `start`; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the value that was at the front of `queue` before it was removed; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
