`new_pos` is assigned the value of `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The previous values of `new_row` and `new_col` are used in this calculation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, and the other variables (`new_state_str`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `directions`, `new_state`, `visited`) remain consistent with the conditions provided.**
