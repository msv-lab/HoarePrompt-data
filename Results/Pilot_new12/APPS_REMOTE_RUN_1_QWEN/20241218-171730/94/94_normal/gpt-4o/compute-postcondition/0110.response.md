The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the string representation of `new_state` to the `queue`. The `new_state_str` is already part of `visited`, so this operation does not add a new unique state to `visited`. The `queue` now includes the `new_state_str`. The `new_state` and `new_state_str` remain the same, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_pos` is recalculated for each direction; `new_state` is updated to be a list representation of `current`; `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`; `visited` includes the new state; `queue` includes the new state (i.e., `queue.append(new_state_str)` has been executed); `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.**
