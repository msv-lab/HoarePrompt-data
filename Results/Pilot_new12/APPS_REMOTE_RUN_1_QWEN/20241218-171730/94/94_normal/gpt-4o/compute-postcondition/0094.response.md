The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the current values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`. However, the code does not affect the `directions`, `current`, `visited`, or `queue` variables. It only calculates the `new_row` and `new_col`.

Since the conditions for calculating `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, and updating `visited` and `queue` are not met in this line of code, these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos`, `new_state`, `new_state_str`, `visited`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
