The code adds the string representation of the new state (`new_state_str`) to the set `visited`. This means that the new state is now marked as visited.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list containing elements, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state` (which is `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped), `new_row` remains `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` remains `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` remains `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `directions` remains consistent, `new_state` is a list identical to `current` except the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, `visited` includes the new state represented by `new_state_str`.**
