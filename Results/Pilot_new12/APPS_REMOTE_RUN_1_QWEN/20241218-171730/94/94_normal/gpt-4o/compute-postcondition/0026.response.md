The code appends the `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the swapped elements in `new_state`. The `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected, and `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged. The `visited` list already includes the string `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`new_state_str` is in the queue, `queue` is updated with `new_state_str`, `visited` includes the string `new_state_str`, `new_state` now has the swapped elements, `current` remains unchanged, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` remain unchanged**
