The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. This means that `new_state_str` is now present in the `visited` set. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is either 0 or 1, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` is a copy of `current`, with `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string that represents the joined elements of `new_state`; `new_state_str` is in `visited`**
