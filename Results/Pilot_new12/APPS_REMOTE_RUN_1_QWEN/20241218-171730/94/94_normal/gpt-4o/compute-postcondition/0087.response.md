The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of the `new_state` list into a single string. The `new_state` list is a copy of `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped. After executing this line of code, the `new_state` list itself does not change, but it is transformed into a string `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list; `current` is a valid puzzle state with an 'X' position; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string representation of the `new_state` list**
