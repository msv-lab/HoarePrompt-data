Postcondition: ***`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` does not change if `new_row` and `new_col` are out of bounds, `queue` contains `start` and `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within bounds and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `visited` contains `start` and `new_state_str` if `new_row` and `new_col` are within bounds and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the value that was at the front of `queue` before it was removed, `empty_row` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 1, 1 if `empty_pos` is 2 or 3, `empty_col` is 0 if `empty_pos` is 0 or 2, 1 if `empty_pos` is 1 or 3, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining elements of `new_state`.***
