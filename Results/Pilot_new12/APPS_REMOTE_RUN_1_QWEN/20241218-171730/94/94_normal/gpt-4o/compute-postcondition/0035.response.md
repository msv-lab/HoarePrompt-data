`visited` is updated to include `new_state_str`. This means that `new_state_str` is added to the set `visited`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_state[empty_pos]` is now the original value of `new_state[new_pos]`, `new_state[new_pos]` is now the original value of `new_state[empty_pos]`, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the swapped elements, `new_state` is a list representation of `current`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `queue` and `visited` remain unaffected, `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `directions` remain unchanged, and `visited` includes `new_state_str`.
