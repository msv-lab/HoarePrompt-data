The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` calculates a new position in a grid using the current `new_row` and `new_col` values. Given that `new_row` and `new_col` both satisfy the condition \(0 \leq \text{new\_row} < 2\) and \(0 \leq \text{new\_col} < 2\), their possible values are 0 or 1.

- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos` is \(0 \times 2 + 0 = 0\).
- If `new_row` is 0 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos` is \(0 \times 2 + 1 = 1\).
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos` is \(1 \times 2 + 0 = 2\).
- If `new_row` is 1 and `new_col` is 1, then `new_pos` is \(1 \times 2 + 1 = 3\).

Therefore, the value of `new_pos` depends on the specific values of `new_row` and `new_col`.

Output State: **`queue` is a non-empty list, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is either 0 or 1, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3**
