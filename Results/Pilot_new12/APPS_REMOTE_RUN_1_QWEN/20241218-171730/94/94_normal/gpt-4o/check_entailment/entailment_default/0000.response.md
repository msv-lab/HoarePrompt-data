Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration. Specifically, the `func_1` function incorrectly returns the top row of the puzzle instead of a single string representation of the entire puzzle. This misrepresentation causes the `func_2` function to operate on incomplete and incorrect data.

For example, consider the following input:
```
AB
XC
AC
XB
```
- The correct combined string representation for Bessie's puzzle is `"AXB C"` (reading row-wise).
- The correct combined string representation for Elsie's puzzle is `"AC XB"`.

However, `func_1` will return `"AB"` and `"AC"`, respectively, which is incorrect. As a result, `func_2` will not be able to correctly determine the reachable states for each puzzle.

To fix this, `func_1` should combine the rows into a single string representation of the puzzle. The corrected `func_1` should look like this:

```python
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + ' ' + puzzle[1]
```

This change ensures that `func_2` operates on the correct string representations of the puzzles, allowing it to accurately determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration.
