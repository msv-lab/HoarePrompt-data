Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the `can_distribute` function checks if the sum of the integer divisions of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the distribution of pieces will meet the requirement that each plate contains at least one piece of cake from either the first or the second cake but not both.

Let's consider a counterexample:

- Input: `n = 4`, `a = 3`, `b = 3`
- According to the problem, we need to distribute the cakes such that each plate gets at least one piece of cake, and no plate gets pieces from both cakes. The goal is to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate.

If we use the current logic:
- For `x = 1`, `a // 1 + b // 1 = 3 + 3 = 6`, which is greater than `n = 4`, so `x = 1` would be returned.
- However, this means each plate could get 1 piece from the first cake and 1 piece from the second cake, violating the condition that no plate can have pieces from both cakes.

The correct approach would involve checking if it is possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces and no plate gets pieces from both cakes. The current implementation does not handle this correctly and may return invalid results for certain inputs.
