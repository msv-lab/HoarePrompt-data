Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not handle the case where one cake has fewer pieces than the number of plates (`n`). Specifically, if `a < n` or `b < n`, the current implementation of `can_distribute` and the binary search in `func_1` will not correctly determine the maximum possible number `x`.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 4 1
```
Here, `n = 5`, `a = 4`, and `b = 1`. According to the problem description, Ivan needs to distribute 4 pieces of the first cake and 1 piece of the second cake among 5 plates such that each plate gets at least `x` pieces of cake, and no plate gets pieces from both cakes. The correct answer should be `1`, because even though there is only 1 piece of the second cake, it can still be distributed to satisfy the condition. However, the current implementation will not correctly handle this case, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
