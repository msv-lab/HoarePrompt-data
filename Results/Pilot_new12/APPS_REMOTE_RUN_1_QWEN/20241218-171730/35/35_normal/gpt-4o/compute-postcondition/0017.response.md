Postcondition: ***`mid` is (low + high) // 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `can_distribute(mid)` returns True if `n` can be distributed starting from `mid`, otherwise it returns False; if `can_distribute(mid)` returns True, `low` is `mid + 1` and `high` remains greater than `low`. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns False, `low` is less than `high` and `high` is now equal to `mid`.***
