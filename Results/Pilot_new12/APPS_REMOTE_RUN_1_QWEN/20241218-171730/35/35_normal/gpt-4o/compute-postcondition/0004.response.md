`low` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. From the initial state, we know `mid` is \(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\). Therefore, `low` becomes \(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\).

Given the initial conditions:
- \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\)
- \(1 \leq a \leq 100\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq 100\)
- `low` is 1
- `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\)
- `mid` is \(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\)
- `can_distribute(mid)` returns True

The updated value of `low` is \(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\). The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `high`, `mid`, and the return value of `can_distribute(mid)` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is \(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2} + 1\), `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\), `mid` is \(\frac{\min(a, b) + 2}{2}\), and the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns True**
