Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `can_distribute(mid)` returns True if `n` can be distributed starting from `mid`, otherwise it returns False; `low` is less than `high`. After the if-else block executes, if `can_distribute(mid)` is True, `low` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is set to `mid`.***
