The value of `mid` is assigned to `low` plus 1. This means that `low` is now `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` remains unchanged, and the conditions involving `can_distribute(mid)`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and the relationship between `low` and `high` are still valid. 

Output State: **`mid` is (low + high) // 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `can_distribute(mid)` returns True if `n` can be distributed starting from `mid`, otherwise it returns False; `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` must be greater than `low` for the loop to continue.**
