State right before the loop, the conditions given are:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `a` is the second integer input
- `b` is the third integer input
- 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100
- 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`
- `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`

The `while True` loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Since there are no conditions specified in the loop itself to determine when to stop, we only need to consider the initial states of the variables.

Given that the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, and `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`**
