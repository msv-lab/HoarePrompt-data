Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is an integer with 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100, `b` is an integer with 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and the conditions `a` ≥ `x`, `b` ≥ `x`, and `(a - x + (b - x)) ≥ x` are met. If these conditions are satisfied, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
