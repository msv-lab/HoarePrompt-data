Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers, and `x` is a value such that `a + b < 3x`. If the condition `a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x)` holds true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition does not hold, no specific changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `x`.**
