Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Output Format**: The program outputs the expression corresponding to the maximum value, but it doesn't strictly adhere to the required format. According to the problem description, certain expressions like \(x^{y^z}\) should be printed as `x^y^z` without parentheses, while others like \((x^y)^z\) should be printed as `(x^y)^z`. However, the current implementation prints all expressions in a consistent format with parentheses around the base and exponent, which does not match the required format.

2. **Expression Printing Logic**: The program constructs a list of tuples containing the evaluated values and their corresponding string representations. When determining the maximum value, it correctly identifies the maximum value and its corresponding expression. However, the way it formats the expression strings does not follow the specific rules outlined in the problem description.

To correct this, the program should differentiate between the two types of expressions when formatting the output. Specifically, expressions of the form \(x^{y^z}\) should be formatted as `x^y^z`, while those of the form \((x^y)^z\) should be formatted as `(x^y)^z`.

Here is a revised version of the program that adheres to the problem description:

```python
import math
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    x, y, z = map(float, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    
    # Calculate and format the expressions
    expr1 = (x ** y ** z, f'x^y^z')
    expr2 = (x ** z ** y, f'x^z^y')
    expr3 = ((x ** y) ** z, f'(x^y)^z')
    expr4 = ((x ** z) ** y, f'(x^z)^y')
    expr5 = (y ** x ** z, f'y^x^z')
    expr6 = (y ** z ** x, f'y^z^x')
    expr7 = ((y ** x) ** z, f'(y^x)^z')
    expr8 = ((y ** z) ** x, f'(y^z)^x')
    expr9 = (z ** x ** y, f'z^x^y')
    expr10 = (z ** y ** x, f'z^y^x')
    expr11 = ((z ** x) ** y, f'(z^x)^y')
    expr12 = ((z ** y) ** x, f'(z^y)^x')
    
    expressions = [expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4, expr5, expr6, expr7, expr8, expr9, expr10, expr11, expr12]
    
    max_value, max_expr = max(expressions, key=lambda pair: pair[0])
    
    # Determine the correct format based on the expression
    if max_expr.startswith('(x^'):
        print(f'({max_expr[2:-1]})')
    else:
        print(max_expr)
```

In this corrected version:
- The expressions are formatted according to the required rules.
- The output is correctly formatted based on whether the expression starts with `(x^` or not.
