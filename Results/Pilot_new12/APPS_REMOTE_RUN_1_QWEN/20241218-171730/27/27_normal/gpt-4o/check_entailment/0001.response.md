Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates all 12 possible expressions and identifies the one with the maximum value. The program handles the input correctly, reads three floating-point numbers with one decimal place, and evaluates all possible combinations of exponentiation. The expressions are then compared, and the one with the highest value is printed according to the specified format. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and examples, it is correct.
