Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the program correctly computes the 12 possible values of the expressions and identifies the maximum value among them. The program then prints the corresponding expression in the required format. The original assessment correctly notes that the program handles all given examples and should work for any valid input within the specified range. The annotated version confirms that the program processes all possible expressions and selects the one with the maximum value, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program is correct.
