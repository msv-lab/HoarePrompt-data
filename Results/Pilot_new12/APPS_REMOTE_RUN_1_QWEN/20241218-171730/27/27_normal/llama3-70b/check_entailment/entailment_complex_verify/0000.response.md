Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value among the 12 expressions and outputs the corresponding expression in the required format. The annotations support this by explicitly stating that the program processes all possible expressions and selects the one with the maximum value, which aligns with the problem description. The program handles all valid inputs within the specified range and format, and the annotated version confirms that the program correctly maps each calculated value to its corresponding expression. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
