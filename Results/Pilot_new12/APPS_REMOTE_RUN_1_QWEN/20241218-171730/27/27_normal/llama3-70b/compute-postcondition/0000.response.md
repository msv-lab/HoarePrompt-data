The code reads three real numbers from input, splits them, and converts them to floats, assigning them to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the exact values of the input are not specified, the output state will reflect that these variables now hold the values of the input split and converted to floats.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, in the range [0.1, 200.0], and they hold the values of the input split and converted to floats.**
