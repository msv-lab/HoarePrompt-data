The code appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The value of `a` is an input integer. The value of `n` and `b` remain unchanged.

- `ratings_before` was originally `['a']`.
- After appending `a`, `ratings_before` becomes `['a', a]`.

The Output State is:
**`ratings_before` is ['a', a], `ratings_after` is [b], `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 1**
