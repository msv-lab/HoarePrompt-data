`a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.

Output State: **`ratings_before` is ['a', a], `ratings_after` is [b], `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 0**
