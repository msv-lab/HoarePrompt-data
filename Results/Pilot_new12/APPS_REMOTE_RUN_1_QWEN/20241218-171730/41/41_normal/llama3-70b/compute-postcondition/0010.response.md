`ratings_after` is appended with the value of `b`, making `ratings_after` become `[b]`. The value of `a` is an input integer and remains unchanged, and the value of `n` and `b` remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ratings_before` is ['a', a], `ratings_after` is [b], `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 1**
