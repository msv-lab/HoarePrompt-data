The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers representing the rating of a participant before and after the round, respectively. The list contains exactly `n` tuples, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Each integer in the tuples is between 1 and 4126 inclusive.

The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but based on typical function outputs for such a description, it could be inferring some result from the input data.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the rating of a participant before and after the round, respectively. It returns a value inferred from the input data, given the constraints on the list size and tuple values.**
