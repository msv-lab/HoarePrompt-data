The code prints 'maybe' to the console, which does not affect any variable values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, and we print 'maybe'.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `False`, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, and we print 'maybe'**
