The code `break` does not change any variable values; instead, it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is inside. Given the initial state, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and we simply indicate that we break out of the loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `ratings_before` is a list containing `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list containing `n` input integers, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]`, `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, and we break out of the loop or conditional statement.**
