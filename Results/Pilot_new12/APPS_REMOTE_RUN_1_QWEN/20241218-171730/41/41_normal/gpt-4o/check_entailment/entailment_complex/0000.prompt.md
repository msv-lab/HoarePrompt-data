You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of n lines where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Each line contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} such that 1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126. The lines are ordered such that the first line represents the top participant and the last line represents the bottom participant of the standings.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        ratings.append((a, b))
        
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False.
    if (not is_rated) :
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` remains `False`, `is_unrated` remains `True`. If for any `i` (1 ≤ i < n), `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` holds true, `is_unrated` becomes `False`. Otherwise, `is_unrated` remains `True`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer. If for any `i` (1 ≤ i < n), `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` holds true, `is_unrated` becomes `False`. Otherwise, `is_unrated` remains `True`. `is_rated` remains `False`.
    if is_rated :
        print('rated')
    else :
        if is_unrated :
            print('unrated')
        else :
            print('maybe')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `is_rated` remains `False`, `is_unrated` remains `True`, and for any `i` (1 ≤ i < n), `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` does not hold true.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer. `is_rated` remains `False`. If for any `i` (1 ≤ i < n), `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` holds true, `is_unrated` becomes `False`. Otherwise, `is_unrated` remains `True`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input consisting of \(n\) lines, each containing two space-separated integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\). It determines whether the participants' ratings are consistent (i.e., no participant has a strictly lower rating than the next one), fully rated (at least one participant has a strictly higher rating than the previous one), or mixed (neither condition is met). Specifically, it:

1. Reads \(n\) and initializes lists to store ratings and boolean flags.
2. Collects \(n\) pairs of ratings into a list.
3. Sets a flag `is_rated` to True if any participant has a different rating than the previous one.
4. If no participant has a different rating (`is_rated` remains False), it checks if the ratings are strictly increasing. If so, it sets `is_unrated` to False; otherwise, it keeps `is_unrated` as True.
5. Prints "rated" if `is_rated` is True, indicating the ratings are fully rated.
6. Prints "unrated" if `is_unrated` is True, indicating the ratings are not strictly increasing.
7. Prints "maybe" if neither of the above conditions is met, indicating the ratings are mixed.

Potential edge cases:
- If \(n = 1\), the function will always print "maybe" because there are no subsequent ratings to compare.
- If all participants have the same rating, the function will print "unrated" since no participant has a strictly higher rating than the previous one.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
