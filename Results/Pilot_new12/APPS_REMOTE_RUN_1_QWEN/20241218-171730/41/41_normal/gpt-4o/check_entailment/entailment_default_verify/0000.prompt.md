You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings.append((a, b))
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
    if not is_rated:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
    if is_rated:
        print('rated')
    elif is_unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if any participant's rating has changed, and if so, it concludes the round is rated. Additionally, it verifies if the participants' ratings are in non-increasing order without any change, which would imply the round is unrated. If neither condition is met, it correctly prints "maybe".

To ensure the correctness, let's consider the different scenarios:

1. **Rated Case**: If at least one participant's rating has changed, the program sets `is_rated` to `True` and prints "rated".
2. **Unrated Case**: If no one's rating has changed but the participants' ratings are not in non-increasing order, the program sets `is_unrated` to `True` and prints "unrated".
3. **Maybe Case**: If the participants' ratings are in non-increasing order and no one's rating has changed, the program prints "maybe".

The program handles all these cases correctly, and there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements as specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes input consisting of \(n\) lines, each containing two space-separated integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\). It determines whether the participants' ratings are consistent (i.e., no participant has a strictly lower rating than the next one), fully rated (at least one participant has a strictly higher rating than the previous one), or mixed (neither condition is met). Specifically, it:

1. Reads \(n\) and initializes lists to store ratings and boolean flags.
2. Collects \(n\) pairs of ratings into a list.
3. Sets a flag `is_rated` to True if any participant has a different rating than the previous one.
4. If no participant has a different rating (`is_rated` remains False), it checks if the ratings are strictly increasing. If so, it sets `is_unrated` to False; otherwise, it keeps `is_unrated` as True.
5. Prints "rated" if `is_rated` is True, indicating the ratings are fully rated.
6. Prints "unrated" if `is_unrated` is True, indicating the ratings are not strictly increasing.
7. Prints "maybe" if neither of the above conditions is met, indicating the ratings are mixed.

Potential edge cases:
- If \(n = 1\), the function will always print "maybe" because there are no subsequent ratings to compare.
- If all participants have the same rating, the function will print "unrated" since no participant has a strictly higher rating than the previous one.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
