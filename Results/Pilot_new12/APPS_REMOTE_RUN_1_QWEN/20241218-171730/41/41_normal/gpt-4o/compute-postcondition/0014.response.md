Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` remains as `[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b')]`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False. If `a != b`, the condition is already met and no changes occur. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the if condition.***
