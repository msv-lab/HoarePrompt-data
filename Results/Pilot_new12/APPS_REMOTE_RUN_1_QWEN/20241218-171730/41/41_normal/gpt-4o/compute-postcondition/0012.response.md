The `ratings` list is updated by appending the tuple `(a, b)`. The values of `a` and `b` are integers provided by input. The `ratings` list initially contains `[('a', 'b')]`, and now it will contain `[('a', 'b'), (a, b)]`. The other variables (`n`, `is_rated`, `is_unrated`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is `[('a', 'b'), (a, b)]`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False**
