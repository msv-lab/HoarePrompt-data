According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `ratings` is `[('a', 'b')]`
- `is_rated` is True
- `is_unrated` is False
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer

Since the loop condition only depends on `n`, and there is no other state change within the loop body that affects the loop's execution, the states remain unchanged except for the value of `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 (since it was already greater than 0 in the previous iteration).

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is `[('a', 'b')]`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
