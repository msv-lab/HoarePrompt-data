The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` were 'input integer', which are now replaced by the actual integer inputs. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is `[('a', 'b')]`, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
