Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)` with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 4126`, `is_rated` remains `False`, `is_unrated` remains `True`. If `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]`, the condition does not change any state. Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
