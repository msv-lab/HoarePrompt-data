The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly from the given code snippet. However, based on the provided constraints, the parameters `n` and `k` are described with their respective ranges. The function's output is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it might return some value or perform some operation involving `n` and `k`.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer in the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000.
- `k` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 9.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters.**
