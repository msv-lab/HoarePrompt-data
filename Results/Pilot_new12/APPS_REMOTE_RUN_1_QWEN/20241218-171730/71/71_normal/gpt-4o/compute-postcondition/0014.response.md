`count_zeros` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` and `k` remains unchanged, and `to_remove` is still 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is `count_zeros + 1`, `to_remove` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is `count_zeros + 1`, `to_remove` is 1**
