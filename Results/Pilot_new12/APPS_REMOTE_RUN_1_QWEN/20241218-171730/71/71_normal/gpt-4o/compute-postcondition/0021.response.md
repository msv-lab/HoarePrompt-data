The code `to_remove += 1` increments the value of `to_remove` by 1. Since `to_remove` was previously set to 1 if a '0' was found or to 2 if no '0' was found, incrementing it by 1 means:

- If `to_remove` was 1, it will become 2.
- If `to_remove` was 2, it will become 3.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `count_zeros`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous state), `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either incremented by 1 if a '0' is found, or remains unchanged, and `to_remove` is either 2 or 3.**
