The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that a loop or conditional block is exited. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous state)
- `k` is an integer
- `count_zeros` is incremented by 1 if a '0' is found, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `to_remove` is set to 1 if a '0' is found, otherwise it is either 2 or 3

After executing the `break` statement, the values of these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous state), `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is incremented by 1 if a '0' is found, otherwise it remains unchanged, and `to_remove` is set to 1 if a '0' is found, otherwise it is either 2 or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
