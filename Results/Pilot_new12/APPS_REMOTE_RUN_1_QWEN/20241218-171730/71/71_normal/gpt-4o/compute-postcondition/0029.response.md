The code `print(len(n) - 1)` prints the length of the string `n` minus 1. This does not change any of the existing variables, but it does print the length of `n` minus 1. Since the print statement does not assign any new values to variables, the values of `n`, `k`, `count_zeros`, and `to_remove` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in the string `n` up to the point where the condition `count_zeros != k` is met, `to_remove` is the number of non-zero digits encountered until the condition `count_zeros != k` is met, or `to_remove` is equal to the length of the remaining string if the loop does not break, and the value of the print statement is `len(n) - 1`.**
