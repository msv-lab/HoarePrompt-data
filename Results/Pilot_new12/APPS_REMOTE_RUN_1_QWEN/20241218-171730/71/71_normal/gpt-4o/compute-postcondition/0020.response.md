The code increments `count_zeros` by 1, which means `count_zeros` will now be one more than its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `to_remove`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous state)
- `k` is an integer
- `count_zeros` is incremented by 1
- `to_remove` is set to 1 if a '0' is found, otherwise it is set to 2

Since the code only affects `count_zeros`, we update it specifically while keeping the rest of the initial state intact.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous state), `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is incremented by 1, and `to_remove` is set to 1 if a '0' is found, otherwise it is set to 2.**
