Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the number `n` itself is already divisible by \(10^k\). According to the problem description, if the number is already divisible by \(10^k\), no digits need to be removed, and the output should be 0. However, the current implementation will always print the number of non-zero digits encountered until the count of zeros reaches `k`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1000 3
```

- The code will count the zeros and non-zero digits.
- It will find three zeros and stop, but it will print the number of non-zero digits encountered, which is 1 (the '1' at the beginning).
- The correct output should be 0 because the number `1000` is already divisible by \(10^3\).

To fix this, the code should check if the last `k` digits are zeros before processing the rest of the digits. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    n_str = str(n)
    
    # Check if the last k digits are zeros
    if n_str[-k:] == '0' * k:
        print(0)
        return
    
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n_str[:-k]):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    
    if count_zeros < k:
        to_remove = len(n_str) - k
    
    print(to_remove)
```

This version first checks if the last `k` digits are zeros and prints 0 if they are. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original logic to count the necessary removals.
