Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the input number `n` ends with digits that are not part of the trailing zeros but still need to be removed to make the number divisible by \(10^k\).

For example, consider the input:
```
10203049 2
```
The program should output `3` because we need to remove three digits ('1', '2', and '3') to get a number divisible by \(10^2 = 100\). However, the current implementation only counts trailing zeros and does not account for non-zero digits before the last set of \(k\) trailing zeros.

To fix this, the program needs to check for the first occurrence of \(k\) zeros from the end of the number and ensure that all digits before these zeros are also considered for removal. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    to_remove = 0
    found_zeros = False
    for i in range(len(n) - 1, -1, -1):
        if n[i] == '0':
            if not found_zeros or found_zeros and i >= len(n) - k:
                found_zeros = True
        else:
            to_remove += 1
    print(to_remove)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles cases where non-zero digits need to be removed to achieve the desired result.
