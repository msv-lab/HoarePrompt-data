Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code only counts the number of zeros in the number `n` and stops once it has counted `k` zeros. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of digits to remove to make the number divisible by \(10^k\), not just to count zeros.

For example, consider the input:
- Input: `10203049 2`

The code will count the first two zeros and stop, resulting in a count of 2 non-zero digits to remove. However, the correct solution would be to remove the digits `1`, `2`, and `3`, resulting in `0049` which is divisible by \(10^2 = 100\). Thus, the correct number of digits to remove is 3.

Therefore, the provided code does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
