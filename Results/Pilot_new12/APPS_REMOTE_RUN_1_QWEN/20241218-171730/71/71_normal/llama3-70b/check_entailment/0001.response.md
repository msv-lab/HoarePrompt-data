Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the input number `n` ends with fewer than `k` trailing zeros. Specifically, the program attempts to repeatedly divide `n` by `10^k` until `n % 10^k == 0`, but it does not account for cases where `n` does not have enough trailing zeros to make it divisible by `10^k`. This leads to incorrect results in such cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input
10203049 2

Output
3
```

The expected output should be `3` because we need to remove three digits (`1`, `2`, and `0`) to make the number `03049` which is `3049` after removing leading zeros, and `3049` is not divisible by `100`. However, the program incorrectly prints `3`.

A correct approach would involve counting the trailing zeros and ensuring that the number of digits to be removed is calculated properly, considering cases where the number of trailing zeros is less than `k`.
