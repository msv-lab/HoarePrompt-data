The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function might be expected to use global variables `n` and `k`, but according to the given format, we only focus on the parameters accepted by the function itself.

Given the constraints, if the function were to operate with these variables, it would imply that `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9. 

Since the function definition does not include any parameters, we can only describe the constraints related to potential internal usage of these variables.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but uses global variables `n` (an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000) and `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).**
