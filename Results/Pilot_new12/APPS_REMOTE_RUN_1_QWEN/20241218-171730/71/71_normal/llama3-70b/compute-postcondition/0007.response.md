The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. This means `n` is updated to its integer quotient when divided by 10.

Given the initial state: `w` is increased by 1; `n` is the integer quotient of `n` divided by 10 and must not be divisible by \(10^k\), after executing `n //= 10`, the value of `n` is updated to its integer quotient when divided by 10. The condition that `n` must not be divisible by \(10^k\) remains unchanged because the operation does not introduce any factor of \(10^k\) into `n`.

Therefore, the output state is: `w` is increased by 1; `n` is the integer quotient of `n` divided by 10 and must not be divisible by \(10^k\).

Output State: **`w` is increased by 1; `n` is the integer quotient of `n` divided by 10 and must not be divisible by \(10^k\)**
