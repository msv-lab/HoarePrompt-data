Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately reflect the logic implemented in the program. The program correctly handles both the initial rising phase and the repeating falling phase of the Mexican wave as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. For `t <= n`, the number of standing spectators is `min(t, k)`, which is correct as the wave is still in the rising phase.
2. For `t > n`, the number of standing spectators is `k - (t - n) % k`, which correctly accounts for the repeating nature of the wave after it has completed one full cycle.

The annotated version clarifies that the program correctly handles the transition from the rising phase to the repeating falling phase. There are no edge cases mentioned that the program fails to address, and the provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
