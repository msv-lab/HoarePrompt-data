Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic:

- For `t <= n`, the number of standing spectators is `min(t, k)` because the wave has not yet reached its full cycle.
- For `t > n`, the wave has completed one full cycle, and the pattern repeats every `k` units. Therefore, the number of standing spectators is `k - (t - n) % k`.

This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program handles both the initial rising phase and the repeating falling phase correctly. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the given problem description and examples.
