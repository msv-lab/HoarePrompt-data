Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \( t > n \). According to the problem description, at time \( t \), the number of standing spectators depends on the following:

- If \( t \leq k \), the number of standing spectators is \( t \).
- If \( k < t \leq n \), the number of standing spectators is \( k \).
- If \( n < t < n + k \), the number of standing spectators is \( n + k - t \).

However, the provided code only handles the first two cases and incorrectly prints \( n + k - t \) for any \( t > n \). This is not consistent with the described behavior. For example, consider the following inputs:

- For \( n = 10 \), \( k = 5 \), and \( t = 12 \):
  - According to the description, at \( t = 12 \), the number of standing spectators should be \( 3 \) (since \( n + k - t = 10 + 5 - 12 = 3 \)).
  - But the program prints \( 5 \), which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic for all potential cases.
