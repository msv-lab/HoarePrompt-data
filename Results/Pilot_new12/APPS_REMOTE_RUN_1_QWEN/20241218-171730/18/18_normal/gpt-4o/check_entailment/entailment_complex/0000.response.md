Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \) from the standard input using `map(int, input().split())`. This matches the required input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Condition Checking and Output**:
   - If \( t \leq k \): The program prints \( t \). This corresponds to the first phase of the Mexican wave where the first \( t \) spectators stand up.
   - If \( k < t \leq n \): The program prints \( k \). This corresponds to the phase where all \( k \) spectators are standing and the remaining spectators sit down.
   - If \( n < t < n + k \): The program prints \( n + k - t \). This corresponds to the final phase where the spectators who stood up after time \( n \) are sitting, and the remaining standing spectators are those who stood up within the first \( n \) seconds.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - For \( t \leq k \), it prints the exact count of standing spectators.
     - For \( k < t \leq n \), it prints \( k \) because all \( k \) spectators are standing.
     - For \( n < t < n + k \), it calculates the correct count of standing spectators based on the position of \( t \) relative to \( n \).

Given these points, the program accurately follows the rules described in the problem statement for all possible values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \) within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
