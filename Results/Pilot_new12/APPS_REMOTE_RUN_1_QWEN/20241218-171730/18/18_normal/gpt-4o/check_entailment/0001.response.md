Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `t` is greater than `n`. According to the problem description, at time `n`, the `n`-th spectator stands and the `(n - k)`-th spectator sits. After time `n`, the pattern of spectators sitting and standing changes, but the program does not account for this properly.

For example, consider the input `10 5 16`:
- According to the description, at time `16`, the 5th spectator should sit and the 6th spectator should stand, resulting in 4 spectators standing.
- However, the program will output `5` because it uses the condition `n + k - t` which incorrectly assumes the number of standing spectators remains `k`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the case when `t > n` by calculating the number of standing spectators based on the remaining cycle after `n`.
