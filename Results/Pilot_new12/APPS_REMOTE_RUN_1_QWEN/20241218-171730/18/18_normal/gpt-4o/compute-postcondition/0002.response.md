The code `print(t)` simply prints the value of `t`. Since `t` is printed but not reassigned, its value remains unchanged. The other variables `n` and `k` also remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ k, and the value of `t` is printed.**
