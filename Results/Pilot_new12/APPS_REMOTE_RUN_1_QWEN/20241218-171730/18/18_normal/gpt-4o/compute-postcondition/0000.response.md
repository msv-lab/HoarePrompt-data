The code `n, k, t = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`. Since the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers within the specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k), after executing this line of code, these variables will hold the new input values.

The output state is: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, and their values are the integers input by the user.**
