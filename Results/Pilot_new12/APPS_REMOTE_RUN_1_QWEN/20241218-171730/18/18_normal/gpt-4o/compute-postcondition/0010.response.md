The function `func` does not accept any parameters, as the provided code snippet only defines the function without any parameters. The constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k) are used to describe the valid range of values for variables within the function, but the function itself does not take these variables as inputs.

Since there are no parameters specified in the function definition, the functionality cannot be described in terms of accepting parameters and returning a value based on those parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters.**
