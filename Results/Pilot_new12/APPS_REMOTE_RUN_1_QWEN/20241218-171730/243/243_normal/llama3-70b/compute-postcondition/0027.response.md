Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, inclusive; `count` is the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to `m`; `n` is 2; `ans` is `[1]`; and `n // 5` is 0. If `n // 5 ** count < m`, then no changes are made to the variables. Since there is no else part, the variables retain their initial values.***
