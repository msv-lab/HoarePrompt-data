`ans.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since `n` is initially 2, `ans` will now contain `[1, 2]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`m`, `count`, `n // 5`) also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, inclusive; `count` is the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to `m`; `n` is 2; `ans` is `[1, 2]`; and `n // 5` is 0.**
