#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000.
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count >= m:
            break
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, inclusive, `count` is the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to `m`, and `n` is 1.
    n = 1
    ans = []
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count < m:
            break
        
        ans.append(n)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the smallest integer such that `n // 5

    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to the input integer `m` (where \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)). It then generates a list of all integers \(n\) such that \(1 \leq n \leq m\) and \(n\) is divisible by \(5^{\text{count}}\), where \(\text{count}\) is the highest power of 5 found. Finally, it prints the length of this list followed by the list itself, separated by spaces. Potential edge cases include when \(m = 1\) or \(m = 100,000\), and the function handles these correctly by setting \(\text{count}\) appropriately. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.
