The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`. It does this by repeatedly dividing `n` by increasing powers of 5 and summing up the results. Specifically, it calculates the sum of `n // power_of_5` for each iteration of the loop where `power_of_5` starts at 5 and is multiplied by 5 in each iteration. The function handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning 0 immediately since 0! has no trailing zeroes. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function correctly handles the scenario where `n` is 0 and all other non-negative integers.
