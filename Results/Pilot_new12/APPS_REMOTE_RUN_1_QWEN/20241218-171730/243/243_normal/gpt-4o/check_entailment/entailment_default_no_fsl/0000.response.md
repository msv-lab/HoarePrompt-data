Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are no values of \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. According to the output hints for `func_2`, if no such \( n \) exists, the function returns an empty list. However, the problem description requires the program to output 0 in such cases. For example, if \( m = 5 \), there are no values of \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly 5 trailing zeroes. The current implementation will return an empty list, which does not meet the problem description's requirement to output 0. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
