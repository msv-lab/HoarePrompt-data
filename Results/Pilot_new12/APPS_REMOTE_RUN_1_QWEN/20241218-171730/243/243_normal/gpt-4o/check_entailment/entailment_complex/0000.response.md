Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where there are no values of \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. According to the problem description, if no such \( n \) exists, the program should output 0. However, the provided code always returns an empty list when no such \( n \) is found, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input \( m = 5 \). There are no positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly 5 trailing zeroes. The function `func_2` will correctly narrow down the search range using binary search, but it will not properly handle the case where the search range is exhausted without finding a valid \( n \). Instead of returning 0, it returns an empty list, which is not consistent with the problem description.
