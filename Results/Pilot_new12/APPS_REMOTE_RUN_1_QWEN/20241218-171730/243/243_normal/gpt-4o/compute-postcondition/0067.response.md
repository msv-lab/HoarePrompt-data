`left` is decremented by 1. The value of `mid` is calculated as \((low + high) // 2\) and the condition `func_1(mid) == m` must hold true. The value of `m` remains unchanged within the given range \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\), `func_1(mid)` must be equal to `m`, and `left` is decreased by 1.**
