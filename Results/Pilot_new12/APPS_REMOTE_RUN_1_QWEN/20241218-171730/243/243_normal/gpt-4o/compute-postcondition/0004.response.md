`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), we can substitute these values into the expression for `mid`.

Since `m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, the value of `high` will be between \(5 \times (1 + 1) = 10\) and \(5 \times (100,000 + 1) = 500,005\). Therefore, `mid` will be calculated as:

\[ mid = \frac{0 + 5 \times (m + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} \]

So, the updated values are:
- `m` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` remains 0
- `high` remains \(5 \times (m + 1)\)
- `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\)
- `result` remains an empty list

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list**
