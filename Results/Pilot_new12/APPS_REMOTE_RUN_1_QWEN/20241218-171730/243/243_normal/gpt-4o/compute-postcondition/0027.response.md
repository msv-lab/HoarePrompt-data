Output State: **`right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 4\)**

Explanation:
- The initial state is given by `right` being \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 3\).
- The code snippet provided is `right += 1`.
- Adding 1 to the initial value of `right` results in `right` becoming \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 3 + 1\), which simplifies to \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 4\).

Since the loop condition is `while func_1(right) == m`, and assuming the function `func_1` is such that it returns `m` for the new value of `right`, the condition will still be satisfied.
