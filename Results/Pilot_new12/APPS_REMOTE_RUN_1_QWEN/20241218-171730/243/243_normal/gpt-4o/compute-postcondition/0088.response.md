Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` within the range of 1 to 100,000. It uses binary search to find the smallest number `mid` such that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`. If such a `mid` is found, it searches for the range of numbers around `mid` where `func_1(n)` equals `m` and returns a list of these numbers. If no such `mid` exists, it returns an empty list. The function also includes a check to ensure that `func_1(mid)` equals `m` before adding numbers to the result list. However, there is a missing edge case where if the function cannot find a valid `mid`, it still returns an empty list instead of indicating that no such range exists.**

This summary captures the actual behavior of the function as described by the code and identifies the edge case where the function might incorrectly return an empty list even if there is no valid `mid`.
