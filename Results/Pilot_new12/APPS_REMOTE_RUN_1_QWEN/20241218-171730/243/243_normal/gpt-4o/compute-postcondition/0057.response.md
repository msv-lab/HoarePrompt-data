Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then we update `high` to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, we find `left` as `mid - k` and `right` as `mid + k + 1`, and set `result` as a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
