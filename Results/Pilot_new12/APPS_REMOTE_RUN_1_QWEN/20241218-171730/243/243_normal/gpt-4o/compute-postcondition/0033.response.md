To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues:

The loop condition is `low <= high`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `zeroes` retain their respective initial values or change based on the if condition.
- If `zeroes < m`, then `low` is updated to \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\) and `high` is updated to \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
- Otherwise, `low` remains 0 and `high` remains \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
- `result` is either an empty list or a list containing integers from 1 to \(5 \times (m + 1) - 1\), depending on the value of `zeroes` relative to `m`.

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `low <= high` must be true.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:
1. **If `zeroes < m`:**
   - `low` is updated to \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1\).
   - `high` is updated to \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
   - In this case, `low` and `high` will always satisfy `low <= high` because \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 1 \leq 5 \times (m + 1)\).

2. **If `zeroes >= m`:**
   - `low` remains 0.
   - `high` remains \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
   - In this case, `low` and `high` will also always satisfy `low <= high` because \(0 \leq 5 \times (m + 1)\).

Given these scenarios, the only way to ensure the loop can continue is to ensure that `low` and `high` are set in such a way that `low <= high` holds true. The values of `m`, `low`, and `high` directly influence this condition.

Since the loop updates `low` and `high` based on the value of `zeroes` relative to `m`, and given that both cases (`zeroes < m` and `zeroes >= m`) ensure `low <= high`, we don't need to adjust any specific state beyond ensuring the loop condition remains valid.

Thus, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be modified to ensure that the loop can continue, which means `low` and `high` must be set such that `low <= high` holds true.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` are set such that `low <= high`**
