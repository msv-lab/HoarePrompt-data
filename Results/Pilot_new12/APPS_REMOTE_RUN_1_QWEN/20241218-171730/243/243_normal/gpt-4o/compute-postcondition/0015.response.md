The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\). After subtracting 1, the new value of `left` becomes \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 1\).

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`; `left` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} - 1\)**
