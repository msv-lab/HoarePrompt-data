The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The previous values of `m`, `high`, `mid`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is the integer value of `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`**
