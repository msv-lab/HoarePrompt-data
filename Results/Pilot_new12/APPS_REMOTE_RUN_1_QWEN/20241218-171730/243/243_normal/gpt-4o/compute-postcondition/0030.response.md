The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given snippet, the execution of the code simply ends the current block without changing the values of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`right` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `result` is a list containing integers from 1 to \(5 \times (m + 1) - 1\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`, `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\)**
