To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the loop continues.

### Given Information:
- The current state is: `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 3\).
- The loop condition is: `while func_1(right) == m`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`.
2. **Current State**: We know that at the end of the previous iteration, `func_1(right)` was equal to `m`.

For the loop to continue executing, `func_1(right)` must still be equal to `m` in the next iteration. This means that `right` must change in such a way that `func_1(right)` remains equal to `m`.

### Steps to Determine the Necessary Adjustments:
1. **Check the Function `func_1`**: We need to understand how `func_1` operates. However, since the function itself is not provided, we assume that `func_1` takes an integer input and returns another integer. For the loop to continue, `right` must be set to a value that makes `func_1(right)` still equal to `m`.
2. **Current Value of `right`**: From the given state, `right` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2} + 3\).

Since the problem doesn't provide the exact behavior of `func_1`, we assume that the value of `right` must be such that `func_1(right)` remains equal to `m`. Without further information about `func_1`, we can only ensure that `right` should be set to a value that satisfies the condition `func_1(right) == m`.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted such that `right` is set to a value that makes `func_1(right) == m` true. Since we don't have the exact function, we can only say that `right` must be set to a value that maintains this equality.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration would be:

**State: right must be such that func_1(right) == m.**
