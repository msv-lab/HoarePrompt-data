Postcondition: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `mid` is \(\frac{5 \times (m + 1)}{2}\); `result` is either an empty list or a list containing integers from 1 to \(5 \times (m + 1) - 1\); `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, and it is either greater than `m` or less than or equal to `m` depending on the branch taken.**
