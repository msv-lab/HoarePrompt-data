`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. This calculates the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The values of `m` and `low` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
