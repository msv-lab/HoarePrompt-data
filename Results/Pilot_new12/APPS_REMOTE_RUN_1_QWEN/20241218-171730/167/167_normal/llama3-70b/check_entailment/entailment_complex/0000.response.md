Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling and Validation**:
   - The program reads the number of cells visited `n` and the list of integers `a`.
   - It checks if all values in `a` are within the range `[1, x * y]` for some `x` and `y` by verifying that the maximum value in `a` is less than or equal to `x * y`.

2. **Matrix Size Checking**:
   - The program iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` up to `1000000` (1e6) to find a suitable pair that satisfies the condition `x * y >= max(a)`.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `NO` and exits.

3. **Path Validity Check**:
   - The function `func_1(x, y)` checks if the sequence of moves described by the path is valid.
   - For each integer `v` in the sequence `a`, it calculates the corresponding row and column indices `(nx, ny)` using the formula `(v - 1) // y` and `(v - 1) % y`.
   - It verifies that each move from the previous position `(px, py)` to the current position `(nx, ny)` is a valid step (i.e., a move of exactly one unit horizontally or vertically).
   - If all moves are valid, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Correct Output Format**:
   - If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found, the program prints `YES` followed by the values of `x` and `y`.

The program adheres to the constraints and logic described in the problem statement. It correctly checks if the given path can be represented as a valid sequence of moves on a matrix of dimensions `x` by `y`, where each step is exactly one unit horizontally or vertically. The function `func_1` ensures that the path respects the movement rules and the matrix boundaries.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality and thus is correct.
