#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a list numbers containing n integers where 1 <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    px, py = 0, 0
    for v in a:
        nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
        
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        
        px, py = nx, ny
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `px` is the final value of `nx`, `py` is the final value of `ny`, `numbers` is a list containing `n` integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both positive integers within the range \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), and a list `numbers` containing \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\) integers where each integer \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). It iterates through the list `numbers` and checks whether the sequence of positions defined by `(a_i - 1) // y` and `(a_i - 1) % y` forms a valid path on a grid where each step must be a move of exactly one unit horizontally or vertically. If any move violates this condition, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if all moves satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`. The function does not modify the input parameters or the list `numbers`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` and `y` remain unchanged, `px` and `py` hold the coordinates of the last position in the sequence, and `numbers` remains unchanged.
