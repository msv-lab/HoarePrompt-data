Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle cases where the initial number of stones is greater than the difference between the number of '+' and '-' operations. Specifically, the program only checks if the number of '-' operations is greater than the number of '+' operations and prints `0` in that case. This logic fails to account for the fact that the final number of stones must be at least `1` if there are more '+' operations than '-' operations, regardless of the initial number of stones. For example, in the input `5 +--+-`, the program incorrectly outputs `0` instead of `1`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
