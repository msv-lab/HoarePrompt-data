Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the number of '-' (minus) operations is greater than the number of '+' (plus) operations. According to the problem description, if the number of '-' operations is greater than the number of '+' operations, the minimal possible number of stones in the pile should be 0. However, the current implementation only prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' operations when the number of '+' operations is greater than or equal to the number of '-' operations. 

For example, consider the following input:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  ---
  ```

- Expected output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Actual output:
  ```
  0
  ```

This case is handled correctly by the code. However, consider another case:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  +++
  ```

- Expected output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual output:
  ```
  3
  ```

This case is also handled correctly. However, consider the case where the number of '-' operations is greater than the number of '+' operations:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  --+
  ```

- Expected output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Actual output:
  ```
  1
  ```

In this case, the code fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, the code is incorrect for every potential case.
