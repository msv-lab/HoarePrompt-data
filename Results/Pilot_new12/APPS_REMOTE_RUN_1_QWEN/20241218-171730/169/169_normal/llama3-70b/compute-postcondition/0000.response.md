The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (as an integer) to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and the code does not affect the string `s`, the only change is in the value of `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length n consisting only of '-' and '+' characters, `n` is an integer entered by the user**
