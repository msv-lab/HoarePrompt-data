Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the integer value of the input, and for every `operation` in `s`, if `operation` is '+', `stones` is incremented by 1. If `operation` is '-', `stones` is decremented by `n`. Otherwise, the value of `stones` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop processes each character in the string `s`.
- If the character is '+', `stones` is incremented by 1.
- If the character is '-', `stones` is decremented by `n`.
- For any other character, `stones` remains unchanged.

Since the loop processes all characters in the string `s`, the final state of `stones` will reflect the cumulative effect of all operations specified in `s`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `s` is an empty string), the initial value of `stones` remains 0.
