The code `print(stones)` prints the current value of the variable `stones`. Since `print` does not modify the value of `stones`, the value of `stones` remains unchanged after the print statement. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the output, which is the current value of `stones`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the integer value of the input, for every `operation` in `s`, if `operation` is '+' then `stones` is incremented by 1, if `operation` is '-' then `stones` is decremented by `n`, otherwise the value of `stones` remains unchanged; the value of `stones` is printed.**
