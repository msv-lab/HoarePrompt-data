The code reads an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and the code does not modify the value of `s`, the string `s` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the input, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "-" and "+".**
