Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly identify a pretty set of positions according to the problem description. The code simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string, ignoring the requirement that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected positions. For example, consider the input "aaaaBaabAbA". The code would output 2 because there are two groups of lowercase letters, but the correct output should be 2, as the positions 6 and 8 (or 7 and 8) form a valid pretty set. The code fails to ensure that there are no uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters, which is a crucial part of the problem description.
