Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions according to the problem description. It iterates through the string, adding lowercase letters to a set and counting them until an uppercase letter is encountered, at which point it updates the maximum count and resets the set. This process ensures that the conditions for a pretty set are met. The program handles all given examples correctly and should work for any input string that satisfies the constraints.
