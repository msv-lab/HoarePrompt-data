Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character. `max_count` is the maximum count of any single character in `s` that meets the conditions in the if and else blocks, considering the new character. If the character `char` was not already present in `current_set`, `current_set` may now contain `char` and `current_count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `current_count` remains unchanged.***
