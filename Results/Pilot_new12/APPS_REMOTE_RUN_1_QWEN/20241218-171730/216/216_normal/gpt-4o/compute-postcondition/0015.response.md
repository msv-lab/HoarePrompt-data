Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any single character in `s` that meets the conditions in the if and else blocks, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0. If the current character of `s` is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, `current_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `max_count` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `current_count`, and then `current_set` and `current_count` are reset.****
