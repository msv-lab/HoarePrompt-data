The line `current_count = 0` sets the value of `current_count` to 0. Since `current_count` was either 1 or 2 if the new character was a lowercase character not previously in `current_set`, or remained 0 otherwise, setting it to 0 ensures that it is now explicitly 0. The other variables (`s`, `max_count`, `current_set`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` must be a non-empty string with at least one more character, `max_count` is the maximum between its original value and either 1 or 2 (if `current_count` is 1 or 2), `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0.**
