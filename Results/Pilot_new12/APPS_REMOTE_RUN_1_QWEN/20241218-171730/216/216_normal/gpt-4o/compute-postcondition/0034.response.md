The code `print(max_count)` simply prints the value of `max_count`. This does not change the value of `max_count` or any other variables. The value of `max_count` remains the same as it was before the print statement. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `current_set`, `current_count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any single lowercase character in `s` that meets the conditions in the if and else blocks, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` is printed**
