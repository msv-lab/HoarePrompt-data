Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it is possible to spend exactly `n` game-coins by purchasing houses, cars, and computers. It iterates through all possible values of `a` (number of houses), `b` (number of cars), and calculates `c` (number of computers) using the remaining coins after purchasing `a` houses and `b` cars. If it finds a combination that satisfies the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n`, it prints "YES" and exits. If no such combination exists, it prints "NO". This approach ensures that all potential combinations are checked, making the program correct for the given problem description.
