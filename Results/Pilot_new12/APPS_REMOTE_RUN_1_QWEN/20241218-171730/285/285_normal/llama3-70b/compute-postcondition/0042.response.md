The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. Since no further operations are performed after this call, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is \(a_{\text{initial}} + 2\), `b` is \(b_{\text{final}} + (k + 1)\), `c` is \(\left(n - (a_{\text{initial}} + 2) \cdot 1234567 - (b_{\text{final}} + k + 1) \cdot 123456\right) // 1234\), and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
