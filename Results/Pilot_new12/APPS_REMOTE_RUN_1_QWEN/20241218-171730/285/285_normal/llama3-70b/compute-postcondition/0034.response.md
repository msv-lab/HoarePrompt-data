The code `exit()` simply exits the program without changing any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1,234,567, `a` is `a_{\text{initial}} + 1`, `b` is `b_{\text{final}} + 2`, and `c` is equal to \((n - (a_{\text{initial}} + 1) \times 1234567 - (b_{\text{final}} + 2) \times 123456) // 1234; printed string is 'YES'**
