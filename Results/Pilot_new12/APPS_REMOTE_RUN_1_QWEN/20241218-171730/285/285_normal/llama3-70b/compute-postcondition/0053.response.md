Postcondition: ***`total` remains 0, `a` remains \(a_{\text{initial}} + 2\), `b` is now \(b_{\text{final}} + (k + 3)\), `c` remains \(\left(n - (a_{\text{initial}} + 2) \cdot 1234567 - (b_{\text{final}} + k + 1) \cdot 123456\right) // 1234\). If the condition \(a \cdot 1234567 + b \cdot 123456 + c \cdot 1234 == n\) holds, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If the condition does not hold, the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.***
