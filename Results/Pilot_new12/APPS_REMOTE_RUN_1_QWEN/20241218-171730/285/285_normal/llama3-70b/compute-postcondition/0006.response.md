The code `exit()` is used to exit the current environment or program. In this context, it means the execution stops here without further changes to the variables. The states of the variables remain as they were before the `exit()` call. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `a * 1234567`, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `c` is equal to `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`, the equation `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` holds true and equals `n`.**
