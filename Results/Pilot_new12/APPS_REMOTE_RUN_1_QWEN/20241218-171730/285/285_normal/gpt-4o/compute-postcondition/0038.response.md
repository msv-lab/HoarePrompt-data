The initial state is given as:
- `remaining_after_houses` must be at least `car_cost`
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (a + 1) * car_cost`
- `a` is `a + 1`

The code snippet is:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```

Let's break down the impact:

1. `a` is incremented by 1, so `a` becomes `a + 1`.
2. `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.

The output state should include:
- `a` is now `a + 1`.
- `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.

The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is `a + 1`; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.**
