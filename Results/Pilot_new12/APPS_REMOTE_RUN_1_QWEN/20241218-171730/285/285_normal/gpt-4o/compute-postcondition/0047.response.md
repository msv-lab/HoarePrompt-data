`remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `remaining_after_houses` are used in this calculation. The precondition that `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be greater than `b_prev + 1` remains valid. The value of `b` is `b_prev + 1`, so `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be greater than `b_prev + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is `a + 1`, `b` is `b_prev + 1`, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1` must be greater than `b_prev + 1`, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`**
