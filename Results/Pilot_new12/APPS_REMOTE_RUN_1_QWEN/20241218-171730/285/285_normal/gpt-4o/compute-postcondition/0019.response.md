To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given for loop and the current state.

Given For Loop:
```python
for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Current State at the end of the previous iteration:
- No specific variables are mentioned in the state description, so we assume there are no specific values or constraints provided for `a`, `n`, or `house_cost`.

Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range `range(n // house_cost + 1)`.
2. **Variable `a`**: This variable takes on integer values from `0` to `n // house_cost`.
3. **Increment**: Each iteration of the loop increments `a` by 1.
4. **Loop Termination**: The loop will terminate when `a` reaches the value of `n // house_cost`.

Since no specific values or constraints are provided for `a`, `n`, or `house_cost` in the state description, we need to consider the general conditions for the loop to execute one more time.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of `a` must be less than `n // house_cost`.
- After the increment in the next iteration, `a` should reach `n // house_cost`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `a` should be `n // house_cost`.
- For the loop to continue, `a` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Hence, the state adjustment needed is:
- `a` should be set to `n // house_cost`.
- `n` and `house_cost` remain as they are because their values do not change within the loop.

Output State:
State: **`a` is `n // house_cost`, `n` must be as it was before, `house_cost` must be as it was before**
