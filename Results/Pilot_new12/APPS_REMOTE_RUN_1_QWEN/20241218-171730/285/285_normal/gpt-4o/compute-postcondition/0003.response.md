According to the given for loop statement, the loop will execute as long as the condition `n // house_cost + 1` evaluates to a positive integer. This means that the loop will start if the result of the expression is greater than 0.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`n`**: The value of `n` must be such that when divided by `house_cost`, the floor division result plus 1 is a positive integer. Since `n` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^9\), we need to ensure that `n // house_cost + 1 > 0`. Given that `house_cost` is 1234567, `n` must be at least 1234567 (since \(1234567 \div 1234567 + 1 = 2\)) to ensure the loop executes.

2. **`house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`**: These values are constants and do not directly affect the loop's execution condition. However, they are part of the initial state, so they remain as given.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be at least 1234567.

So, the final state is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and n must be at least 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234**
