Postcondition: ***`remaining_after_houses` is greater than 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no specific action is taken, and the postcondition remains as per the precondition.***
