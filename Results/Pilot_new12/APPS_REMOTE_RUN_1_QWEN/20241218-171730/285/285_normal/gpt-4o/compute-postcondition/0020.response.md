`remaining_after_houses` is assigned the value of `n - a * house_cost`. The values of `a` and `house_cost` are derived from the initial state, where `a` is `n // house_cost`. Therefore, `remaining_after_houses` is calculated as `n - (n // house_cost) * house_cost`.

Output State: **`a` is `n // house_cost`, `n` is as it was before, `house_cost` is as it was before, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - (n // house_cost) * house_cost`**
