Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. The function `func_1` iterates through all possible combinations of spending on houses, cars, and computers, ensuring that the remaining amount can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer. This approach covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description. The code handles the constraints and examples provided in the output hints accurately, making it correct for every potential case.
