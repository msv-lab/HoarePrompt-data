According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `j` is 1
- `vol` is 1
- `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[0]`
- `n` is a positive integer

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.

Since the loop does not depend on the value of `vol` or `dp[i]` to determine if it should continue executing, these states do not need to be modified. The value of `n` remains unchanged as long as it is still a positive integer.

State: **`j` is 2, `vol` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[0]`, and `n` is a positive integer**
