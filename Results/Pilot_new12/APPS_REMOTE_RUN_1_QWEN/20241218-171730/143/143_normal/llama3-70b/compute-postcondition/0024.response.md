Postcondition: ***`costs` is a list of integers, `L` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element from 1 to `L` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]` if `vol` (which is 2) is less than or equal to `i`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is solely based on the if part.***
