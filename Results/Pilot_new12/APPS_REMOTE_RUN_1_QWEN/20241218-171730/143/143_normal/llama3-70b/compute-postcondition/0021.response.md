The code assigns the value `2 ** j - 1` to the variable `vol`. However, the value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, and no previous value of `vol` is mentioned. Therefore, the only information that changes is the assignment of `vol`. The output state will include this new assignment.

Output State: **`costs` is a list of integers, `L` is an integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element is updated based on the smallest `vol` values up to `i` for each index `i` from 1 to `L`, `dp[0]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `vol` is `2 ** j - 1`**
