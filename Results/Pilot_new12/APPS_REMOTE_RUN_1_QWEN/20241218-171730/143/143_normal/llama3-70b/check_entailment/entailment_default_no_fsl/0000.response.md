Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to obtain at least `L` liters of lemonade. The code handles the edge case where `L` is 0 by setting `dp[0] = 0`. It also correctly checks if it is possible to obtain at least `L` liters of lemonade by ensuring that `dp[L]` is not infinity before printing the result. The code logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases as described in the hints and examples.
