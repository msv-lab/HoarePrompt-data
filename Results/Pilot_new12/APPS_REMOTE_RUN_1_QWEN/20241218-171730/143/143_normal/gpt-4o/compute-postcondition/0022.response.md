`L` is decremented by \(1\) left-shifted by `i` (which is 30). This means `L` is effectively decremented by \(2^{30}\).

Given the initial state:
- `answer` is `max_cost`
- `i` is 30
- `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[30]`
- The value of `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^{30}\)

After executing the line of code:
- `L` is decreased by \(2^{30}\)
- The other variables (`answer`, `i`, `current_cost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answer` is `max_cost`, `i` is 30, `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[30]`, and `L` is `L - 2^30`.**
