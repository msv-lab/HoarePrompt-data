#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. It returns `True` if `x` passes all the conditions within the function, and `False` otherwise. Specifically:
- If `x` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
- If `x` is between 1 and 3 inclusive, it returns `True`.
- If `x` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
- For other values of `x` greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks if `x` is not divisible by any integer of the form \( i \) or \( i + 2 \) where \( i \equiv 5 \mod 6 \) and \( i^2 \leq x \). If `x` passes this check, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the cases where `x` is 1, 2, or 3.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is divisible by 2 or 3.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is a prime number greater than 3.
- The function may have missed handling cases where `x` is a composite number that is not divisible by 2 or 3 but still fails the primality test (e.g., numbers like 25, 35, etc.).
