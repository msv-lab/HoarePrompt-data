The value of `i` is incremented by 6. Since `i` was previously an integer such that `x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25, and the function does not return anything, the conditions on `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `i` is the original value plus 6.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, not divisible by 2 or 3, and at least 25; `i` is increased by 6**
