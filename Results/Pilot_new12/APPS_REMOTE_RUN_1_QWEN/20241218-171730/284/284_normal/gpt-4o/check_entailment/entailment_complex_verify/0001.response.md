Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides detailed insight into the behavior of the `func_1` function and the main program logic. Based on the annotations, the function `func_1` correctly determines whether a number is prime according to the specified criteria. The main program iterates through values of `m` from 1 to 1000, checking if `n * m + 1` is a prime number using `func_1`. Since the annotations confirm that the function will correctly identify non-prime numbers, and the main program guarantees to find and print a suitable `m` for any input `n` within the specified range, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
