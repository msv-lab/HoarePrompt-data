Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear states and logic flow, which align with the program's functionality. The program iterates over values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number using the `func_1` function. If it finds a counterexample, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop. The `func_1` function correctly implements a primality test for numbers greater than 1, ensuring that if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, it will be identified. The annotations confirm that the program will eventually find and print a suitable \( m \) for any given \( n \) within the specified range, thus proving PolandBall's hypothesis incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
