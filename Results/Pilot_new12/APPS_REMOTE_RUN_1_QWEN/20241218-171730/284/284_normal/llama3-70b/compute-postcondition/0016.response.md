Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range of 1 to 1000. It checks whether `num` is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any number in this range, the function returns `False`. If no divisors are found (i.e., `num` is not divisible by any number in the range), the function returns `True`. There are five possible outcomes: the function returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, if `num` is divisible by any number in the range [2, âˆšnum], or if `num` is less than 2 after the loop. The function returns `True` if `num` is a prime number and no divisors are found.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `num` is 1, the function returns `False` because the condition `if (num < 2)` is true.
- If `num` is a prime number within the range (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.), the function returns `True`.
- If `num` is a composite number (e.g., 4, 6, 8, etc.), the function returns `False`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases outside the range of 1 to 1000, although the preconditions ensure this is not a concern.
