Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets the problem description. The annotated version provides clear states and transitions within the program, which support the correctness of the logic implemented. Specifically:

1. The program iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
2. For each \( m \), it calculates \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this value is prime using the `func_1` function.
3. If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime, the program prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

Given that the problem guarantees the existence of such an \( m \) for any \( n \) within the specified range, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \). The annotated version confirms that the logic correctly identifies non-prime numbers and prints the corresponding \( m \). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
