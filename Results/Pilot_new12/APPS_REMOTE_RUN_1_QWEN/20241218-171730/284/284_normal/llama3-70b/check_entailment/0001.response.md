Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis for any given \( n \). The program iterates through values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a composite number using the `func_1` function. Since it is guaranteed that there exists at least one \( m \) within the specified range that makes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) a composite number, the program will always find and print such an \( m \).

The `func_1` function correctly checks if a number is prime by ensuring it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Given the constraints and guarantees in the problem statement, the program handles all potential cases as required.
