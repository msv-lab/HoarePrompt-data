The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on certain conditions involving three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000.

However, since no specific output logic is provided, we can only state that the function returns a value without specifying what that value is (as the problem statement does not provide the exact conditions or values to return).

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the conditions involving three non-negative integers a, b, and c, where 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000.**
