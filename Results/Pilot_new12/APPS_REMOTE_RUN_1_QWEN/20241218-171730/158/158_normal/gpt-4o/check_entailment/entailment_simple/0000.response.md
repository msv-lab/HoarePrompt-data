Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. This part matches the problem description perfectly.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The variable `max_lemons` is set to the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available number of lemons (`a`) or the available number of apples and pears adjusted according to their required ratios.
   - The expression `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` calculates the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote, ensuring that the ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears is maintained.
   - Finally, the program prints `total_fruits`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no fruits can be used (i.e., `max_lemons` is 0), the program correctly outputs 0, which aligns with the problem description.

4. **Compliance with Problem Description**:
   - The program ensures that no fruits are broken or cut into pieces, adhering to the requirement that fruits should be used whole.
   - It handles all valid input within the specified range (1 to 1000) correctly.

Given the above points, the program accurately implements the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
