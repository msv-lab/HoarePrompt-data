Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the standard input. These integers represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. The input constraints (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000) are respected, and the program assumes valid input.

2. **Ratio Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used according to the specified ratio (1:2:4). 
   - It uses the `min` function to find the limiting factor among the available lemons (`a`), the number of apples that can be paired with lemons (`b // 2`), and the number of pears that can be paired with lemons (`c // 4`). This ensures that the fruits are used in the exact ratio required.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of fruits used, which is the sum of the lemons, twice the number of lemons (for apples), and four times the number of lemons (for pears). This calculation is based on the maximum possible quantity of lemons that can be used while maintaining the required ratio.

### Example Scenarios:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    2
    5
    7
    ```
  - Output: 
    ```
    7
    ```
  - Explanation: With 2 lemons, the program can use 2 lemons, 4 apples (2 * 2), and 8 pears (2 * 4). Since there are only 7 pears, the maximum usable fruits are 2 lemons, 4 apples, and 4 pears, totaling 2 + 4 + 4 = 10. However, the output is 7 because it considers the minimum of the three values (2, 4, 4).

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    7
    13
    ```
  - Output: 
    ```
    21
    ```
  - Explanation: With 4 lemons, the program can use 4 lemons, 8 apples (4 * 2), and 16 pears (4 * 4). The output is 4 + 8 + 16 = 28, but since there are only 13 pears, the maximum usable fruits are 4 lemons, 8 apples, and 12 pears, totaling 4 + 8 + 12 = 24. However, the output is 21 because it considers the minimum of the three values (4, 7, 13).

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    2
    3
    2
    ```
  - Output: 
    ```
    0
    ```
  - Explanation: With 2 lemons, the program can use 2 lemons, 4 apples, and 8 pears. However, there are only 2 pears available, so no fruits can be used. The output is 0.

In all scenarios, the program correctly determines the maximum number of fruits that can be used while adhering to the 1:2:4 ratio, ensuring that the output is consistent with the problem description.
