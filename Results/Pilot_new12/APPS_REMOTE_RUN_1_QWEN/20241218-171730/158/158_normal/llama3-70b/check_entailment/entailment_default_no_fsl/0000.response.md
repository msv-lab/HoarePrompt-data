Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote. The logic in the program uses `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` to determine the number of lemons that can be used, but it does not ensure that the number of apples and pears used are exactly double and quadruple the number of lemons, respectively. Instead, it prints `8 * min_lemon`, which is not necessarily the correct solution.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
5
7
```
The correct output should be `7` because Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. However, the program incorrectly calculates the output as `8 * 1 = 8`, which is incorrect.

The program should instead use the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` to determine the number of lemons that can be used, and then calculate the corresponding number of apples and pears, ensuring that the ratios are maintained. The correct implementation would be:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4))
```

This ensures that the ratios are correctly maintained and the maximum number of fruits is used.
