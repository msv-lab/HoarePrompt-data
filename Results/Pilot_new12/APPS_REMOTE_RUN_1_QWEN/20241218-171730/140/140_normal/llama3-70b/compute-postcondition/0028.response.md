Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a `node`, a `graph` represented as a dictionary, and two lists `visited` and `rec_stack` as inputs. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. If a cycle is detected during the DFS traversal starting from the given `node`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function uses the `visited` list to keep track of visited nodes and the `rec_stack` list to detect cycles. If a node is encountered that is already in the recursion stack (`rec_stack`), a cycle is detected, and the function returns `True`. If no cycle is detected and the DFS completes, the function returns `False`. This function can handle graphs with cycles and acyclic graphs.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that the `graph` dictionary contains valid keys and values, which means it should handle scenarios where the `graph` might be empty or contain invalid entries.
- The function does not handle the case where the graph is disconnected. If the starting `node` is not part of the connected component, the function will incorrectly return `False` without exploring other components.
- The function does not modify the `visited` and `rec_stack` lists outside of the current function call scope. However, since these lists are passed by reference, changes made within the function will affect the original lists, which is expected behavior.
- The function does not handle self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes explicitly, although it can still detect cycles in such cases due to the nature of the DFS algorithm.
