The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. 

- `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that have a directed edge coming out from the key vertex.
- `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack respectively, both initialized as empty lists.

The function has multiple return points, which result in either returning `True` or `False`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `node`, a dictionary `graph`, and two lists `visited` and `rec_stack`, and return `True` in several cases and `False` in one case based on the conditions checked within the function body.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `node`, a dictionary `graph`, and two lists `visited` and `rec_stack`. It returns `True` in multiple cases and `False` in one case.**
