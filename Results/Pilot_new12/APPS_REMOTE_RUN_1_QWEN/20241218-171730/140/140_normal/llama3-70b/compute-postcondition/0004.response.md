Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where `graph[node]` contains at least one element, `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack` is a list with `rec_stack[node] = True`, and `visited[neighbor]` is `False`. The function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` evaluates to `True` and the current neighbor being checked has not been visited.***
