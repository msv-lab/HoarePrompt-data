To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and steps involved:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
   - `visited[node]` is `True`.
   - `rec_stack[node]` is `True`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `graph[node]`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `visited[neighbor]` is `False` and `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns `True`, the function returns `True`.
   - If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `True`, the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, the function does not change the state of `visited[node]` and `rec_stack[node]`.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute another iteration, the loop condition (iterating over neighbors) must hold true.
   - The loop body checks two conditions:
     - `visited[neighbor]` is `False` and `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns `True`.
     - `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `True`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `visited[node]` and `rec_stack[node]` are already `True`, they will not change during this iteration.
   - The loop will continue to the next neighbor in `graph[node]` as long as there are unvisited neighbors or neighbors where `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `True`.

6. **Final State**:
   - The only thing that changes during each iteration is the neighbor being checked.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that the current node's state remains the same (`visited[node]` and `rec_stack[node]` are still `True`), and we need to identify the next neighbor to be processed.

Given that the loop continues as long as there are unvisited neighbors or neighbors with `rec_stack[neighbor]` as `True`, the state adjustment involves ensuring that the conditions for the next iteration are met.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `visited[node]` is `True`.
- `rec_stack[node]` is `True`.
- The next neighbor to be processed is yet to be determined based on the graph structure and the conditions within the loop body.

Thus, the state remains unchanged for `visited[node]` and `rec_stack[node]`, but we need to note that the next neighbor is yet to be processed.

**State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `visited[node]` is `True`, `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. The next neighbor to be processed is yet to be determined.**
