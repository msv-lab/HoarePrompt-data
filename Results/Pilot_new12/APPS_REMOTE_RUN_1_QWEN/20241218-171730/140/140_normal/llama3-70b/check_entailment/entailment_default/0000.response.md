Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine whether the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. The function `func_1` is designed to detect cycles using DFS, but it does not consider the possibility of removing an edge to break a cycle.

To illustrate, let's consider the following input:

```
Input:
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
```

According to the problem description, the graph contains a cycle (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1). However, the provided code does not check if removing any single edge can break this cycle. Instead, it simply checks if the graph contains any cycle at all.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The function `func_1` correctly detects cycles in the graph.
- However, it does not attempt to remove any edge and check if the graph becomes acyclic.
- The main logic of the program does not consider the possibility of removing an edge to break the cycle.

To fix this, the program needs to:
1. Perform a DFS to detect cycles.
2. For each detected cycle, attempt to remove one edge and check if the graph becomes acyclic.
3. If removing any single edge breaks the cycle, return "YES"; otherwise, return "NO".

Since the provided code does not implement this additional logic, it cannot correctly determine if the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
