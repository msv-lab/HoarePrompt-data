You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) where for each edge `(u, v)` in `edges`, `graph[u]` contains `[v]`.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `m` is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), `edges` is a list of tuples, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) where for each edge `(u, v)` in `edges`, `graph[u]` contains `[v]`. The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the number of vertices, `m` is the number of edges, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges in the graph, `graph` is a defaultdict(list) where for each vertex `u`, `graph[u]` includes `v` as an additional element, and the graph does not contain any cycle.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of edges, with the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000).
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, with the constraints 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.

The function constructs a directed graph using the provided edges. It then checks if the graph contains a cycle using the `has_cycle(graph)` function. If the graph contains no cycle initially, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it iterates over each edge in the graph, temporarily removing the edge and checking if the graph still contains a cycle. If removing an edge breaks the cycle, it returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found and the graph remains cyclic, it returns 'NO'.

This function effectively determines whether the graph can be made acyclic by removing a single directed edge. The final state of the program after executing the function is either 'YES', indicating that a single edge can be removed to break all cycles, or 'NO', indicating that no single edge can be removed to break all cycles.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex. The graph represents a directed graph with n vertices and m edges.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is a list of vertices representing the outgoing edges from that vertex; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and n inclusive) and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges (in-degree) for that vertex; `u` is a vertex that was iterated over in the loop at least once.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is empty, `count` is the total number of nodes with an in-degree of 0, `node` is the last node dequeued from the queue, `in_degree` dictionary is updated such that each neighbor's in-degree has been decremented by the number of times they became 0.
    return count != n
    #`The program returns count != n where 'count' is the total number of nodes with an in-degree of 0 and 'n' is the total number of nodes in the graph`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_cycle` accepts a directed graph represented as a dictionary and returns whether the graph contains a cycle. Specifically, it performs a topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm (also known as the in-degree zero queue method). The function first calculates the in-degree of each node. Then, it initializes a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0 and counts these nodes. It processes each node in the queue by decrementing the in-degrees of its neighbors. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0 during this process, it is added to the queue. After processing all nodes, if the count of nodes with an in-degree of 0 is not equal to the total number of nodes (`n`), then the graph contains a cycle, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that the function can handle graphs with cycles and graphs without cycles, including edge cases where the graph might have multiple components or nodes with the same in-degrees.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
