The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Since `v` is not specified in the initial state, we can consider `v` as a vertex that is different from `u` (as `u` is mentioned to be a vertex such that `graph[u]` is not empty). The initial state does not provide a specific value for `in_degree[v]`, but it states that `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges for that vertex.

Therefore, the value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least one key remaining, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is the total number of incoming edges for that vertex plus 1 for the vertex `v`, `u` is a vertex such that `graph[u]` is not empty and contains at least one vertex.**
