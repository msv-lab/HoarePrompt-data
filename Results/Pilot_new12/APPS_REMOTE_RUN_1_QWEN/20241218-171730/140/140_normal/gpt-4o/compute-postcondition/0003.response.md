The code increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Since `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is initially 0, the value of `in_degree[v]` will be updated to 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`graph` must have at least one key, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and the corresponding value is either 0 (for vertices other than `v`) or 1 (for `v`), `u` is a vertex in `graph`, `v` is an adjacency vertex of `u` in `graph`**
