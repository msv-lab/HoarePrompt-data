The code appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The `node` was the first element in the `queue`, `count` was increased by 1, and `in_degree[neighbor]` was decreased by 1 and equals 0. After appending the `neighbor` to the `queue`, the `queue` now includes the `neighbor` as its new last element. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is the first element that was in `queue` before the operation, `queue` contains all the remaining elements from its initial state except for the first element and the newly appended `neighbor`, `count` is increased by 1, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 and equals 0**
