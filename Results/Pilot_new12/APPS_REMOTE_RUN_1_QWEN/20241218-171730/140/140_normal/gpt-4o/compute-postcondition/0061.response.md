Output State: **`node` is the last processed node, `queue` contains all nodes whose in-degree became 0, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 for each neighbor of `node`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop processes each node's neighbors, decrementing their in-degrees.
- When a neighbor's in-degree reaches zero, it gets added to the queue.
- This process continues until no more nodes can be added to the queue (i.e., all nodes have had their in-degrees decremented and none of them have an in-degree of zero).

Since the loop processes all nodes in the graph, the final state will be that `node` will be the last node processed, `queue` will contain all nodes whose in-degrees became zero, `count` will be the total number of nodes whose in-degrees became zero, and `in_degree[neighbor]` will be decremented by 1 for each neighbor of the last processed node.
