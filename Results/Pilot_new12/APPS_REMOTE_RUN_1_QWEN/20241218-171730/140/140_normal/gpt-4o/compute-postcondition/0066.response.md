The code `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decrements the in-degree of the `neighbor` by 1. The precondition specifies that `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 for each neighbor of `node`. This means that `in_degree[neighbor]` will be reduced by 1.

Since the initial state includes that `queue` is not empty, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue, and `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`, the only variable affected by the code is `in_degree[neighbor]`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `queue` is not empty (unchanged)
- `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1 (unchanged)
- `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue (unchanged)
- `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`
- `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1

Output State: **`queue` is not empty, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue, `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1**
