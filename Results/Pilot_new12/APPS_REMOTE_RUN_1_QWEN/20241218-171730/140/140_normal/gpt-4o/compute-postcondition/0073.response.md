Postcondition: ***`queue` includes the original elements plus `neighbor` on the right end, `count` is the total number of nodes whose in-degree became 0 plus 1, `node` is the node that was dequeued from the left side of the queue, and `neighbor` is a neighbor of `node`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is determined solely by the if part.***
