`in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The value of `in_degree[v]` was previously `in_degree[v]`, and now it is `in_degree[v] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[u]` must contain at least one vertex, `in_degree` remains the same, `u` remains the same, `v` is the next vertex in `graph[u]`, `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1.**
