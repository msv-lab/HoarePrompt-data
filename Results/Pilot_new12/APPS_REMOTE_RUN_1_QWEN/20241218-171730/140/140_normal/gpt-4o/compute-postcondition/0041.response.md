The code decrements the `in_degree` of the `neighbor` by 1. This operation affects only the `in_degree[neighbor]` variable, while the other variables (`node`, `queue`, `count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is the next node in the queue, `queue` is the updated queue reflecting the removal of the previously processed node and addition of nodes whose in_degree became 0, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `count` remains unchanged.**
