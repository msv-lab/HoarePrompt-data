Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not check for the impossibility of transforming matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) through the allowed operations. The output hints confirm that the program always returns -1 in all cases, which means it fails to identify situations where the transformation is impossible. This is evident from the example input provided:

```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

In this case, no sequence of operations can transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \), yet the program incorrectly returns -1 without identifying this impossibility. Therefore, the program is not fully correct for every potential case.
