Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code only checks for 2x2 submatrices where all four elements are 1 and sets those positions in matrix `B` to 1. However, this approach does not guarantee that `B` will be transformed into `A`. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

The expected output should be `-1` because it is impossible to transform matrix `B` into matrix `A` using the allowed operations. However, the provided code does not account for cases where the transformation is not possible. It only checks if the 2x2 submatrices match the required pattern without considering the overall configuration needed to transform `B` into `A`.

Therefore, the code fails to handle all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect outputs in some scenarios.
