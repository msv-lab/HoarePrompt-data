Final: **False**

### Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Impossible Cases:**
   - The program assumes that the required operations can always transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \). However, it does not explicitly check if such a transformation is possible. For example, if there is a 0 in the bottom-right corner of matrix \( A \), it is impossible to achieve this configuration using the allowed operations since setting a 2x2 submatrix to 1 will always result in 4 ones, and there is no way to remove these ones without additional operations.

2. **No Comprehensive Check for Possibility:**
   - The program does not check if it's possible to make matrix \( B \) equal to matrix \( A \) using the allowed operations. This is a critical oversight because if it's impossible, the program should return `-1`. The current implementation will incorrectly proceed with setting submatrices to 1 even when it is not feasible to achieve the desired configuration.

Given the lack of a comprehensive check for the possibility of transforming matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \), the program cannot be considered fully correct for every potential case. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate.
