Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( n \) is at least 2.
- \( i \) is \( n - 1 \).
- \( m \) is at least 2.
- \( j \) is \( m - 2 \).

The condition for adding an operation to the list `operations` is that the 2x2 submatrix at positions \((i, j)\), \((i, j + 1)\), \((i + 1, j)\), and \((i + 1, j + 1)\) in matrix `A` are all 1.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to \( m - 2 \). Therefore, at the end of each iteration, `j` increases by 1.

### Current State:
- \( i = n - 1 \)
- \( j \) is currently \( m - 2 \)

### Next Iteration:
- The loop will increment `j` by 1. Therefore, \( j \) will become \( m - 1 \).

### Adjusted States:
- \( n \) remains at least 2.
- \( i \) remains \( n - 1 \).
- \( m \) remains at least 2.
- \( j \) becomes \( m - 1 \).

### Final State:
- \( n \) is at least 2.
- \( i \) is \( n - 1 \).
- \( m \) is at least 2.
- \( j \) is \( m - 1 \).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is \( n - 1 \), `m` is at least 2, and `j` is \( m - 1 \)**
