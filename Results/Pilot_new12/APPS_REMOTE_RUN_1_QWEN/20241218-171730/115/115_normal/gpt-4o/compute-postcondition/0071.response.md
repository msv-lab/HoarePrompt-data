Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and for every `i` and `j` in the range `[0, n)` and `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`**.

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `total` is 0.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `n` is at least 2.
  - `m` is at least 2.
  - `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.
  - `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.
  - For every `j` in the range `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.

- **Loop Condition**: 
  - The loop iterates over `j` in the range `[0, m)`.
  - For each `j`, the loop checks if `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`.
  - If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1.

- **After Loop Execution**:
  - If the loop completes all its iterations without finding any discrepancy between `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]`, the function does not return anything.
  - This means that for every `j` in the range `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` must be equal to `B[i][j]`.

- **Final State**:
  - After the loop executes all its iterations, `total` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
  - `i` remains 1 because the loop only increments `j` and does not change `i`.
  - `n` and `m` remain at least 2 because they are not modified within the loop.
  - `A` and `B` are still 2D lists of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and for every `i` and `j` in the range `[0, n)` and `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.

Thus, the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations is that `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the positions (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corners of the 2x2 submatrices in `A` that satisfied the condition and were flipped in `B`, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and for every `i` and `j` in the range `[0, n)` and `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.
