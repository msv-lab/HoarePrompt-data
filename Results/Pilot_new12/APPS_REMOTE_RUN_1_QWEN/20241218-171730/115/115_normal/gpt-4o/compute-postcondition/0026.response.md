Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is `m - 2`. If the 2x2 submatrix at positions \((i, j)\), \((i, j + 1)\), \((i + 1, j)\), and \((i + 1, j + 1)\) in matrix `A` are all 1, then the operation \((n, m - 1)\) is added to the list `operations`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur.***
