Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `m` is at least 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - The submatrix starting from `A[i][j]` (which is `A[0][1]`) to `A[i + 1][j + 1]` (which is `A[1][2]`) has been checked.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs over `j` in the range `range(m - 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2`.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value in the range. Therefore, `j` will become 2.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `m` remains at least 2.
   - `i` remains 0 since the loop is iterating over `j`.
   - `j` becomes 2.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - Since the submatrix check and the conditions for `B` and `operations` were based on the previous values of `i` and `j`, these values do not change for the next iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2.**
