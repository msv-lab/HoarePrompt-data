The code assigns the value 1 to four elements in a matrix `B`. Specifically, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1. Given the initial states:

- `n` is at least 2, so `n` >= 2
- `i` is `n - 2`, so `i` = `n - 2`
- `m` is at least 2, so `m` >= 2
- `j` is `n - 1`, so `j` = `n - 1`

The output state after the code is executed will be:

- `i` remains `n - 2`
- `j` remains `n - 1`
- `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 2`; `j` is `n - 1`; `B[i][j]` is 1; `B[i][j + 1]` is 1; `B[i + 1][j]` is 1; `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1**
