The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` remain unchanged. The state of the precondition is updated only for the `operations` list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `m` is at least 2, and `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1; `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are unchanged and are still equal to 1; `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
