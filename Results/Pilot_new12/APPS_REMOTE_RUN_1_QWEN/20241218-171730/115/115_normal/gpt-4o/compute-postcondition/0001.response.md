The code initializes a new 2D list `B` where each row contains `m` zeros. This means that `B` is a list of `n` lists, and each of these inner lists contains `m` zeros. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the contents of `A` and `operations` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a 2D list of integers where each row contains `m` zeros.**
