The code `print(op[0], op[1])` prints the first and second elements of the tuple stored in the list `ops`. The values of these elements are taken from the initial state, but the variables themselves remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple based on the specified conditions, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500, `op[0]` is the first element of the tuple in `ops`, `op[1]` is the second element of the tuple in `ops`.**
