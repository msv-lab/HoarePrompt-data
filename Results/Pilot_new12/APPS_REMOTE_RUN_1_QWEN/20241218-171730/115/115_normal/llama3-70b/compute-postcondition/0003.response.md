Let's break down the given state and the for loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(2 \le n, m \le 50\).
- `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, and the matrix `A` is populated with input values.
- `ops` is an empty list.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

2. **Variable `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 because the loop will increment `i` in each iteration. Therefore, `i` must be 0 initially.

3. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`, so `n` must be at least 2 (since \(2 \le n, m \le 50\)). However, to ensure the loop runs at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 (i.e., \(n \ge 3\)).

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`m`, `A`, and `ops`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly. They remain as described.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state so that `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 3.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is an empty list.**
