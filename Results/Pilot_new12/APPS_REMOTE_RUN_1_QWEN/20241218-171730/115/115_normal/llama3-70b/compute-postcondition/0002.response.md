The code initializes an empty list named `ops`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `m` or the matrix `A`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `ops` list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that \(2 \le n, m \le 50\); A is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, and the matrix `A` is populated with the input values; `ops` is an empty list.**
