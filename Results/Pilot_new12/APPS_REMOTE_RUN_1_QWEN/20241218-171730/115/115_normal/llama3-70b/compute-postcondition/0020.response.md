Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, and after executing the if-else block, the list `ops` now includes the tuple `(1, j + 1)` for at least one valid index `j` such that \(2 \le j < m - 1\) and `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`.**
