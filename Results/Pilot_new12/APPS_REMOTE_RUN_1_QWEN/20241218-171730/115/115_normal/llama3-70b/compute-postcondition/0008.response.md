Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, and `ops` is an empty list. There exists at least one valid index `j` within the bounds of the matrix such that `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`.***
