Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, and there exists at least one valid index `j` such that `j < m - 1` and `A[0][j] == 1` or `A[0][j + 1] == 1` or `A[1][j] == 1` or `A[1][j + 1] == 1`. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, no changes are made to the matrix `A` and the tuple `(1, 2)` remains in the list `ops`. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the matrix `A` and the tuple `(1, 2)` remains in the list `ops`.***
