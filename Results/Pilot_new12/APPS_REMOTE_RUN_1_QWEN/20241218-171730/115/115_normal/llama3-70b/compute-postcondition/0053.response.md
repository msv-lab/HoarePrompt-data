Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` contains all the tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for which any of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\), or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\) are satisfied, plus the new tuple \((3, 4)\), and `j` is 3. If none of the specified conditions are met, no changes occur to `i`, `n`, `m`, `A`, `ops`, or `j`.***
