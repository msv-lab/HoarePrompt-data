The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided in the initial state or within the code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any direct impact on the variables outside of a loop. Therefore, the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **State remains unchanged**
