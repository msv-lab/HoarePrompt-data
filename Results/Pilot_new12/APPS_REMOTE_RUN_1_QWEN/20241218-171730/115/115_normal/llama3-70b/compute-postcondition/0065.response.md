Let's break down the requirements and identify the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

1. **Variable `op`**: The variable `op` is expected to iterate over each tuple in the `ops` list. For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple.

2. **Length of `ops`**: The problem specifies that the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500, but this is not a condition that prevents the loop from executing if `ops` is empty. However, it ensures that the loop will terminate after processing up to 2500 elements.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as follows:
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3
   - `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\)
   - `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1
   - `ops` is a list containing all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` based on certain conditions for valid indices `j` in the range `[0, m - 2]`

Given these points, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that the list `ops` is not empty. If `ops` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Initial Value of `i`**: `i` is already set to `n - 1`.
2. **Value of `n`**: `n` is given as a non-negative integer with at least 3, so this is fine.
3. **Value of `m`**: `m` is given as an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), so this is fine.
4. **Matrix `A`**: `A` is defined as a matrix of size `n` by `m` with elements being 0 or 1. This is also fine.
5. **List `ops`**: The critical adjustment here is ensuring that `ops` contains at least one tuple.

### Conclusion:
The necessary adjustment for the loop to execute is that the list `ops` must contain at least one tuple.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size `n` by `m` where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple based on the specified conditions, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500.**
