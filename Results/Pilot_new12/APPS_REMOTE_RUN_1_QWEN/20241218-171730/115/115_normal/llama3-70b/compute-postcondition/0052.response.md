The code snippet `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, where `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `i + 1` equals 3, and `j + 1` equals 4, the tuple to be appended is `(3, 4)`. This tuple is added to the list `ops`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `A`, and `j`) remain unchanged because the operation only affects the list `ops` by appending the new tuple.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer with at least 3, `m` is an integer such that \(2 \le m \le 50\), `A` is a matrix of size \(n \times m\) where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples from the initial conditions plus the new tuple `(3, 4)`, and `j` is 3.**
