Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it fails:

1. **Logic for Setting Submatrices**:
   - The problem requires setting a `2x2` submatrix to all `1`s if any of its elements in `A` are `1`. However, the current implementation does not correctly identify and set these `2x2` submatrices.
   - The current code checks if any of the four corners of a `2x2` submatrix are `1`, but it does not actually set the `2x2` submatrix to all `1`s. Instead, it appends coordinates to the `ops` list if any of the elements are `1`.

2. **Setting `2x2` Submatrices**:
   - To correctly set a `2x2` submatrix to all `1`s, you need to ensure that the `2x2` submatrix starting at position `(i, j)` is set to all `1`s. This means setting `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j+1]`, `B[i+1][j]`, and `B[i+1][j+1]` to `1`.
   - The current implementation does not modify the matrix `B` at all. It only appends the coordinates to the `ops` list, which is insufficient to achieve the goal.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The problem specifies that if it is impossible to make `B` equal to `A`, the program should print `-1`.
   - If it is possible, the program should output the sequence of operations needed to transform `B` into `A`.
   - The current implementation does not output the sequence of operations; it only prints the length of `ops`, which might not be the actual sequence of operations required.

### Correct Implementation Example:

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly sets the `2x2` submatrices and outputs the sequence of operations:

```python
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]  # Initialize B to all zeros

    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))

    # If more than 2500 operations, return -1
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Apply the operations to B
    for op in ops:
        i, j = op
        B[i-1][j-1], B[i-1][j], B[i][j-1], B[i][j] = 1, 1, 1, 1
    
    # Check if B matches A
    if B != A:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])

# Example usage:
func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We initialize matrix `B` to all zeros.
- We collect the necessary operations in the `ops` list.
- We check if the number of operations exceeds the limit.
- We apply the operations to `B` and verify if `B` matches `A`.
- Finally, we print the length of `ops` and the sequence of operations.

This implementation ensures that the program correctly follows the problem description.
