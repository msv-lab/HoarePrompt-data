Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the matrix \( B \) can be transformed into matrix \( A \) by performing the required operations. The current implementation only checks if certain elements in the matrix \( A \) are 1 and adds operations to the list without considering the overall feasibility of transforming \( B \) into \( A \).

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 1
```

In this case, the program will not produce the correct sequence of operations because it does not check if the submatrices of \( B \) can actually be set to 1 to match \( A \). The program simply checks if individual elements are 1 and adds operations accordingly, which is not sufficient to guarantee that \( B \) can be transformed into \( A \).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the submatrices can be set to 1 in such a way that the entire matrix \( B \) can be made equal to \( A \). This requires a more comprehensive approach to validate the feasibility of the transformation before generating the sequence of operations.
