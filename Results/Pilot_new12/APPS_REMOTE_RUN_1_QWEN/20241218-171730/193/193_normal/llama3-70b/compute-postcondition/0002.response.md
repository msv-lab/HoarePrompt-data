The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`.

Given the constraints and the fact that no parameters are listed in the function definition, we can infer that the function might internally use values for `x` and `y` within its defined range to compute or return a value.

However, since no specific return conditions or logic are provided, we can only state the constraints and the expected range for `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`.**
