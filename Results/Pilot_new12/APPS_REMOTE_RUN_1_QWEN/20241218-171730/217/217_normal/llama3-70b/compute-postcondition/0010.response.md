Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.
   - `b` and `c` are integers.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `i % 2 == 0`, then `b` is incremented by `a[0]`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is incremented by `a[i]`.

4. **Current State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - According to the loop condition, since `i` is now 1 (which is odd), `c` will be incremented by `a[1]`.

5. **States to Be Adjusted:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `c` will be incremented by `a[1]`.

Given these points, we can formulate the new states as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` and `c` are integers, `i` is 1, and `c` is incremented by `a[1]`**.

However, since we are only asked to provide the states that need to be adjusted, we can simplify it to:

State: **`i` is 1, and `c` is incremented by `a[1]`**.

Since the other states (`n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged, we focus on the relevant ones:

State: **`i` is 1, `c` is incremented by `a[1]`**.
