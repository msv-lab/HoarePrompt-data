Output State: **`b` is the sum of all elements in `a` at even indices; `c` is the sum of all elements in `a` at odd indices; `i` is `n-1`; `print(b - c)`**

Explanation: The code `print(b - c)` does not modify any variables. It simply prints the difference between `b` and `c`. The values of `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `a` remains a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order also remains valid.
