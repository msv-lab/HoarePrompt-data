`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces. The length of this list is `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The values of the elements in `a` depend on the input provided by the user, but the structure of `a` is now a list of integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers**
