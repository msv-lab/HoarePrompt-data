The function reads an integer \( n \) and then reads \( n \) integers from the input. It sorts these integers in descending order and then calculates the difference between the sum of elements at even indices and the sum of elements at odd indices. The function prints this difference. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when \( n \) is 1, in which case both sums would be zero, resulting in an output of 0. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.
