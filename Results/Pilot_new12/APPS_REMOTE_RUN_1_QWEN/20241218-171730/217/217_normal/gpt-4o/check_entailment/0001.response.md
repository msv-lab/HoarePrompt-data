Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the value of \( B - C \). It sums all positive numbers to \( B \) and all negative numbers to \( C \), and then calculates \( B - C \). This approach ensures that all elements are partitioned into two sequences, and the resulting \( B - C \) is maximized because all positive numbers contribute positively to \( B \) and all negative numbers contribute negatively to \( C \).

Since the program handles all elements of the sequence and computes the desired output without any issues for the given constraints, it is correct according to the problem description.
