Final: **False**

Reason: Although the program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) by summing the positive elements to \( B \) and the negative elements to \( C \), it does not handle cases where \( n \) is outside the range 1 to 100. The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the program works correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints without explicitly handling out-of-range inputs. According to the output hints, the program will raise an error if \( n \) is outside this range, which means it does not fully meet the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be revised to reflect this limitation.
