The code `G_pos = line.index('G')` finds the index of the character 'G' in the string `line`. This will assign an integer value to `G_pos`, which represents the position (index) of the first occurrence of 'G' in the string `line`.

Since the initial state includes that `n` and `k` are integers entered by the user, and `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', the only variable that gets updated is `G_pos`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `line` retains its original string.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer entered by the user, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `line`.**
