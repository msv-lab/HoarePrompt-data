The code `T_pos = line.index('T')` searches for the first occurrence of 'T' in the string `line` and assigns its index to the variable `T_pos`. The initial values of `n`, `k`, `line`, and `G_pos` remain unchanged.

After executing the code, the value of `T_pos` will be the index of the first 'T' in `line`. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `G_pos` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is the integer entered by the user, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line`**
