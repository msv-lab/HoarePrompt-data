Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `T_pos` is greater than or equal to `G_pos`, `reachable` is `False`, and if the character at position `pos` in `line` is '#', then we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement. If the character is not '#', the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.***
