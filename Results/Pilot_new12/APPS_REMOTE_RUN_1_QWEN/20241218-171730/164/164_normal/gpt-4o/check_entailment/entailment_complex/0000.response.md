Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the input values `n` and `k` do not satisfy the constraints `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1`. According to the problem description, the function should check these constraints before proceeding with the main logic. However, the annotated program does not include any validation for these constraints, leading to undefined behavior for invalid inputs.

To correct this, the function should add a check at the beginning to ensure that `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges. Here is an example of how to add this check:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Check if the input values satisfy the constraints
    if not (2 <= n <= 100) or not (1 <= k <= n - 1):
        print("Invalid input")
        return
    
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    
    if (G_pos > T_pos):
        G_pos, T_pos = T_pos, G_pos
    
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
    
    if reachable:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

With this addition, the function ensures that it only proceeds with the main logic if the input values are valid, thereby meeting the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program needs this validation to be considered correct.
