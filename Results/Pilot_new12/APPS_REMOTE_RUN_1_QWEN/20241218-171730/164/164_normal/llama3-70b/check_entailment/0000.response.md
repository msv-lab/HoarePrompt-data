Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the grasshopper can reach the insect given the constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all cases:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and `k`, and the string `s` representing the line of cells.

2. **Identifying Start and Target Positions**: The program identifies the positions of 'G' and 'T' in the string `s`. If either 'G' or 'T' is not found, it immediately prints 'NO'.

3. **Distance Check**: The program checks if the absolute difference between the positions of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`. This ensures that a valid sequence of jumps exists.

4. **Obstacle Check**: The program iterates through the possible jump positions to ensure no obstacles are encountered during the journey from 'G' to 'T'. It uses modular arithmetic (`(g + i * k) % n`) to handle circular indexing if necessary.

Since the program handles all specified cases correctly and follows the problem description precisely, it is deemed correct.
