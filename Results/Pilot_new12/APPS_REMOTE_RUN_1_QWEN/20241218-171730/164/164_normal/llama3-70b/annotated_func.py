#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The second line of input is a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' represents an empty cell, '#' represents a cell with an obstacle, 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' represents the insect's position. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is `n`, `g` is the index of the first 'G' in `s` (or -1 if no 'G'), and `t` is the index of the first 'T' in `s` (or -1 if no 'T').

If `abs(t - g) % k == 0` and for every integer `i` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, the character at index `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` is not '#', the function does not execute any additional actions beyond the existing conditions. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is `n`, `g` is the index of the first 'G' in `s` (or -1 if no 'G'), `t` is the index of the first 'T' in `s` (or -1 if no 'T'). If either there is no 'G' in `s` or no 'T' in `s`, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if `abs(t - g) % k == 0` and for every integer `i` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, the character at index `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` is not '#', the function does not execute any additional actions beyond the existing conditions. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters \( n \) and \( k \), where \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 100, and \( k \) is an integer between 1 and \( n-1 \). It also takes a string of length \( n \) containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' represents an empty cell, '#' represents a cell with an obstacle, 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' represents the insect's position. The function checks if the grasshopper can jump to the insect's position following these rules: the distance between the grasshopper and the insect must be divisible by \( k \), and the path taken by the grasshopper must not contain any obstacles. If the conditions are met, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles the case where either the grasshopper or the insect is not present in the string by printing 'NO'.
