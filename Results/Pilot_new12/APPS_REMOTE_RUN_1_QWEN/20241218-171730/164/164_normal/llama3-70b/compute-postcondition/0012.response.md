The code `g = i` assigns the value of `i` to `g`. From the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `g` is also assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is 1, `g` is 1, `t` is -1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and 0 otherwise.**
