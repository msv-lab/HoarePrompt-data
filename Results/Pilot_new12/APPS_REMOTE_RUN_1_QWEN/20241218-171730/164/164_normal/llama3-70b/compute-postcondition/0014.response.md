Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is 1, `g` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and -1 otherwise, `t` is 1. This means that if `s[i]` equals 'T', `t` is set to 1. Since there is no else part, `t` remains unchanged if `s[i]` does not equal 'T'.***
