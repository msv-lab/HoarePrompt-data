The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both are integers. The constraints are 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The function also accepts a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. 

Based on the given constraints and relationships, the function does not return a value directly but rather seems to process the string to determine something (though the specific output is not provided). However, following the format and the given example, we focus on the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.**
