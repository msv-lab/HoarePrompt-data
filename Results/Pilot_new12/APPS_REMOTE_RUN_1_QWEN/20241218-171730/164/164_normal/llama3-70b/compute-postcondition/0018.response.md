`t` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial value of `i` is 2, so `t` is assigned 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is 2, `g` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and -1 otherwise, `t` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `i` is 2, `g` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'G' and -1 otherwise, `t` is 2**
