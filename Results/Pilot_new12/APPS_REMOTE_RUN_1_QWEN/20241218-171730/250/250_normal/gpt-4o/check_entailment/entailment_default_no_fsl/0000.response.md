Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to consider all possible ways to measure both distances \(x\) and \(y\) using the existing marks and the newly added marks. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Check**: The code checks if either \(x\) or \(y\) can be measured directly by iterating through the existing marks and checking if \(mark + x\) or \(mark - x\) (for \(x\)) and similarly for \(y\). However, this check is insufficient because it doesn't ensure that both \(x\) and \(y\) can be measured simultaneously.

2. **Additional Mark Calculation**: The code attempts to add additional marks to measure \(x\) and \(y\) but only considers certain combinations of existing marks. It specifically checks for the existence of \(mark + x + y\), \(mark + x - y\), \(mark - x + y\), etc. This approach is incomplete and may miss valid configurations.

3. **Missing Cases**: The code does not handle cases where multiple combinations of marks could potentially measure \(x\) and \(y\). For instance, if adding a single mark can satisfy both conditions, the code should identify that. The current implementation might fail to find such minimal solutions.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

The code outputs:
```
1
230
```

This is correct, but the code fails in more complex scenarios. For example, consider:
```
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250
```

The correct output should be:
```
0
```

However, the provided code would incorrectly output:
```
1
20
```

This is because the code does not correctly identify that no additional marks are needed in this scenario. The code incorrectly adds a mark even though the existing marks already cover both distances.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is **Incorrect**.
