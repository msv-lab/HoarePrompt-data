According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `marks`. For the loop to execute again, the list `marks` must still have at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions were met:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `marks` must be a non-empty list
- `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`
- `x_found` is set to True
- `y_found` is set to True
- `marks` has at least one remaining element
- The condition `x_found and y_found` is True, causing a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, `marks` must still have at least one remaining element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is set to True, `marks` has at least one remaining element**
