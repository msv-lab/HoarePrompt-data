The code `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value of `mark - y` to the set `new_marks`. Since `mark` is an element from the list `marks`, and `y` is an integer, the value of `mark - y` is added to the set `new_marks`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (non-empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set that now includes the value `mark - y`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (non-empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - y`.**
