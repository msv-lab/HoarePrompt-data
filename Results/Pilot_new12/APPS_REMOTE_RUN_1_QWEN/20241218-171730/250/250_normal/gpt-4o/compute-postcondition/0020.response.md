The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or block. In this case, since there is no loop or block context provided, the `break` statement does not change any variable values or add new conditions. It simply indicates that the execution would exit the current loop or block.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is set to True, `marks` has at least one remaining element. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
