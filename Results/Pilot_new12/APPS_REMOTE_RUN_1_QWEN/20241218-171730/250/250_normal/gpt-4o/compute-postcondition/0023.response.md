The line `x_found = True` simply sets the variable `x_found` to `True`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions and values of the other variables remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `marks` must be a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is set to True, `marks` has at least one remaining element**
