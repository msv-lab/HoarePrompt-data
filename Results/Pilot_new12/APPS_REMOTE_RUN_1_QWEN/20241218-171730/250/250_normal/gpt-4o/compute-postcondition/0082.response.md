`result` is appended with the value of `x`. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we keep it as `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `True`, `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the final iteration through all `marks`, and `result` is a list containing `x`.**
