The code `result.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `result`. The previous value of `result` is a list containing `x`, and `y` is currently `False` according to the initial state. After appending `y` to `result`, the list `result` will contain both `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (potentially empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the final iteration through all `marks`, and `result` is a list containing `x` and `y`.**
