`new_marks` adds the value of `mark - x` to the set. The previous value of `mark` is part of the `marks` list, but since the exact value of `mark` is not specified, we denote it as `mark`. The value of `x` is a non-negative integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a non-empty list of integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, and `new_marks` is a set containing the updated results based on the next `mark` in `marks` (including `mark - x`).**
