Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `mark` and `y` are such that either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is an element of `marks_set`, `x_found` is set to True, `y_found` is set to True, `marks` has at least one remaining element. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
