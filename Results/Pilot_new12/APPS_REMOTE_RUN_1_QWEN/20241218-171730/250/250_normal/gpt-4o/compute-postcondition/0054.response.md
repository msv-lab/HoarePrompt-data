`new_marks.add(mark + x)` adds the value of `mark + x` to the set `new_marks`. Since `mark` is the current element from the `marks` list and `x` is not defined in the initial state, let's assume `x` is a constant or another variable that holds a specific value. However, without a specific value for `x`, we'll keep it general.

The initial state does not provide a specific value for `x`, so `mark + x` will be added to `new_marks` with the current value of `mark`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `marks` is a list of integers (non-empty), `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + x`, where `mark` is the current element from the `marks` list.**
