Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider that the additional marks might need to be inserted in such a way that both `x` and `y` can be measured. The current implementation only checks if `x` or `y` can be measured directly or by adding a single mark, but it does not ensure that both `x` and `y` can be measured after potentially adding multiple marks.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 300 185 230
0 300
```

The program will output:
```
2
185 230
```

This is correct according to the solution. However, consider another case:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

The program will output:
```
1
230
```

This is also correct. But consider the case:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

The program will again output:
```
1
230
```

However, this is incorrect because it fails to check if adding a mark at 20 cm would allow both 185 and 230 to be measured. The correct answer should be:
```
1
20
```

Since the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, it is not fully correct.
