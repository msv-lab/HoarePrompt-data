Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not consider all possible ways to achieve the required distances by adding the minimum number of marks. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
1
230
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
20
```

This is incorrect because adding a mark at 20 cm does not help in measuring both 185 cm and 230 cm. The correct additional mark to add is 230 cm. The program incorrectly appends the difference `i + j` to `additional_marks` without ensuring that the additional mark can actually help in measuring both required distances. Therefore, the program does not always provide the minimum number of additional marks needed.
