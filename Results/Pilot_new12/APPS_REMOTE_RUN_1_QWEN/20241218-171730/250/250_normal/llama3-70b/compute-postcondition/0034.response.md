Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same index as before, `j` is `i + 2`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 2`. If `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no action specified in the else part.***
