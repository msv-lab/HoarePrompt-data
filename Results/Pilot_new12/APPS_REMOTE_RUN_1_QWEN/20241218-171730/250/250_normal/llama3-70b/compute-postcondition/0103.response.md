Output State: **`additional_marks` is a set of all elements that can be formed by adding `i` (the next element in the `marks` list) to each element in the original `additional_marks` list such that the sum is less than or equal to `l` and is not already present in `marks`. `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.** 

### Explanation:
- Initially, `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`.
- During each iteration of the loop, the element `i` (the next element in the `marks` list) is checked against each element `j` in `additional_marks`. If \(i + j \leq l\) and \(i + j\) is not already in `marks`, then `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.
- This process continues until no more valid sums can be added to `additional_marks` based on the conditions specified.
- Since the loop stops when no further additions are possible, the final `additional_marks` will contain only those sums that satisfy the conditions and are not already in `marks`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `additional_marks` is empty), then `additional_marks` remains an empty list.
