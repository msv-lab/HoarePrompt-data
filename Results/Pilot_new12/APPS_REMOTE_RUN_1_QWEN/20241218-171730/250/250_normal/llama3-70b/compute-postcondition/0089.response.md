The code appends the value of `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. According to the initial state, `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`. After appending `i + j`, the condition that `i + j` should not be already present in `marks` and should satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) still holds.

Therefore, the updated state of `additional_marks` will include the new element `i + j`.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, and now includes the new element `i + j`.**
