Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the index `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `need_x` is `True` because `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` was found, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. After the execution of the if-else block, if `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` is true, then `need_y` remains `True`; otherwise, `need_y` remains `True` as no new condition is introduced in the else part. `n` is the length of the `marks` list, where `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.***
