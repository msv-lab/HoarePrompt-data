Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the last value `i` took during the loop (which will be `n-1`), `j` is the last value `j` took during the loop (which will be `n-1`), `need_x` is `False` if there exists no pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, otherwise `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` remains `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, otherwise `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`. The if statement does not change the value of `need_y`, while the conditions for `need_x` and the state of `additional_marks` are updated based on the execution of the if block.***
