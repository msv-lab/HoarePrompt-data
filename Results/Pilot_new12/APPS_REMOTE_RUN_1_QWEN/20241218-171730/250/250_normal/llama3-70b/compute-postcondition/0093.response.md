State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy \(i + j \leq l\) and are not already present in `marks`, `i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `j` is the first element in the `additional_marks` list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over each element in `additional_marks`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `additional_marks` must be a non-empty list.
3. Each element in `additional_marks` must satisfy the condition \(i + j \leq l\), where `i` is an element from the `marks` list.
4. Each element in `additional_marks` must not already be present in the `marks` list.
5. The variable `j` will take the value of the first element in `additional_marks` during the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can start executing, we need to adjust the state to reflect these conditions.
