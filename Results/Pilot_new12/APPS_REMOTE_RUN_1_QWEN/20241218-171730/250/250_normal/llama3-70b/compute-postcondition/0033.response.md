`need_y` is assigned the value `True`, which does not change its previous state. The states of the other variables (`marks`, `i`, `j`, `need_x`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same index as before, `j` is `i + 2`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.**
