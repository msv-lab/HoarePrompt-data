Output State: **`additional_marks` is a set of all elements that can be formed by adding an element from the `marks` list to each element in the original `additional_marks` list such that the sum is less than or equal to `l` and is not already present in `marks`. `i` is the last value `i` took during the loop (which will be `n-1`), `j` is the last value `j` took during the loop (which will be `n-1`, and `need_x` is `False` if there exists no pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, otherwise `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` remains `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, otherwise `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`.**
