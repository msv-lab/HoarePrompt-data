`need_y` is set to `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the index `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `need_x` is `True` because `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` was found, `need_y` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, and `n` is the length of the `marks` list. Currently, `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` is true, where `j` is `i + 1` and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
