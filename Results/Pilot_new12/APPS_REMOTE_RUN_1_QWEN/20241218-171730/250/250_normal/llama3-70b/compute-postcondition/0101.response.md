The code appends the value of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` list. Given that `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, it means `j` is the last element added to the list before this line of code. Therefore, the last element in `additional_marks` before the append operation is `i + j`. After the append operation, the new last element in the list will be `i + j`.

Output State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing its previous elements plus the element `i + j`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`**
