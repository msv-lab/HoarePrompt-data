Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `additional_marks` is a non-empty list.
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition does not explicitly depend on the loop variable `j`. Instead, it modifies the `additional_marks` list based on the values of `i` (which is not defined in this context) and `j`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element `j` in `additional_marks`, we need to ensure that there are elements left to iterate over.
   - The list `additional_marks` must remain non-empty for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Formulate the New State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `additional_marks` was non-empty.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must still be non-empty.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list.**
