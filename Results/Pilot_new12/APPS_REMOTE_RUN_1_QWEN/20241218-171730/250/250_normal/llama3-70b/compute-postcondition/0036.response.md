The given code snippet does not include any executable lines that would change the state of the variables. The only line provided is `need_x = True`, which sets the variable `need_x` to `True`. Since no other changes are made to the variables, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`marks` remains the same, `i` is the same, `j` is `i + 3`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`.**
