State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the index `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `need_x` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, `need_y` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, `n` is the length of the marks list, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `j` iterates from `i` to `n-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` should be a valid index in the list `marks`.
3. Since `i` is given as `i + 1`, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is a valid index, which means `n > i + 1` (i.e., `n > i + 1`).
4. The values of `need_x` and `need_y` depend on the existence of certain elements in the list `marks` relative to the current value of `i`.
5. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to include these conditions.

Thus, the required state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the index `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `need_x` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, `need_y` is `True` if there exists any `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, `n` is the length of the marks list, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
