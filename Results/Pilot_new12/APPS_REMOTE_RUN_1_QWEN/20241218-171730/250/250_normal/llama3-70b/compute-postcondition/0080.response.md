Let's break down the given information and determine the necessary adjustments step by step.

### Given Information:
- `additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy the condition `i + j <= l` and are not already present in `marks`.
- The list remains unchanged if no such elements are found.
- The loop iterates over `marks`.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `additional_marks` is a non-empty list (since it was mentioned as a non-empty list at some point).
- The list contains elements that satisfy `i + j <= l` and are not already in `marks`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in marks:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the `marks` list.
- There is no condition within the loop that directly modifies the `additional_marks` list or the `marks` list itself during the loop execution.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `marks`.

### Determining the Next State:
- Since the loop is iterating over `marks`, it implies that we are considering each element in `marks` one by one.
- The only change that affects the state here is the iteration process itself.
- After each iteration, the loop variable `i` takes the next value from the `marks` list.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop is iterating over `marks` and there are no changes to `additional_marks` within the loop, the state of `additional_marks` remains the same. The only thing that changes is the current value of `i`.

### Updated State:
- `additional_marks` is still a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy `i + j <= l` and are not already present in `marks`.
- The next value of `i` will be the next element in the `marks` list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy `i + j <= l` and are not already present in `marks`, and `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.**

State: **`additional_marks` is a non-empty list containing elements that satisfy `i + j <= l` and are not already present in `marks`, and `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.**
