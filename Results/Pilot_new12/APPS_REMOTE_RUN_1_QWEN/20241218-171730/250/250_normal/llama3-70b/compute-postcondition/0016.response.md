Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `marks` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is the same as before.
   - `j` is `j_end + 1`.
   - `need_x` is `True`.
   - `need_y` is `True`.
   - The condition inside the loop is `if marks[j] - marks[i] == y`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` from `i` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j_end + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented and should still be within the range `[i, n)`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be `j_end + 2`.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `j` is within the range `[i, n)`.
   - Given that `j` is currently `j_end + 1`, the loop will execute if `j_end + 2` is still less than `n`.

5. **Variables to Update:**
   - `j` should be updated to `j_end + 2`.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` remain unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes their values. Since the condition inside the loop does not change `need_x` or `need_y`, these variables remain `True`.

Based on this analysis, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`marks` is a list of integers, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j_end + 2`, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True`.**
