Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` followed by a string of `n` digits from standard input.
   - This part matches the problem description perfectly, where it specifies reading `n` and then the ticket digits.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the ticket as a list of integers.
   - It calculates the total sum of the digits.
   - If the total sum is odd, it immediately returns `False`, which aligns with the requirement to check if the total sum is even.
   - If the total sum is even, it calculates `target_sum` as half of the total sum.
   - It then iterates through the digits, maintaining a running sum (`curr_sum`).
   - Whenever `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, it increments the `segments` counter and resets `curr_sum`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `segments` is at least 2, returning `True` if so, and `False` otherwise.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the ticket is lucky (i.e., if `func_1` returns `True`), and "NO" otherwise.
   - This matches the problem statement's requirement to output "YES" or "NO" based on whether the ticket is lucky.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the sum of digits is odd by immediately returning `False`.
   - It also handles the case where the sum is even and the ticket can be divided into multiple segments with equal sums by incrementing the `segments` counter appropriately.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement for all possible inputs, making it correct.
