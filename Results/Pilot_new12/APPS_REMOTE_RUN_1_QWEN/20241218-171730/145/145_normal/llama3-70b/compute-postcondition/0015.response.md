The code increments the value of `segments` by 1. The values of the other variables (`ticket`, `total_sum`, `target_sum`, `curr_sum`, and `segments`) are updated as follows:

- `ticket` remains a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits.
- `total_sum` remains the sum of all digits in `ticket`.
- `target_sum` remains `total_sum // 2`.
- `curr_sum` remains increased by the current digit from `ticket`.
- `segments` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits, `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is increased by the current digit from `ticket`, and `segments` is increased by 1.**
