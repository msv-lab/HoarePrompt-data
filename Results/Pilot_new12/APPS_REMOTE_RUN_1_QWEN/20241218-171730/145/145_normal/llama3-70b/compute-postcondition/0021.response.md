`curr_sum` is set to 0, which overwrites its previous value. The values of `ticket`, `total_sum`, `target_sum`, and `segments` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`curr_sum` is 0, `ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits, `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, and `segments` is increased by 1.**
