`target_sum` is assigned the value of `total_sum // 2`. Since `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket` and it is given that this sum is even, `target_sum` will be half of this even number, which is also an integer.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of exactly n digits (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each digit is between '0' and '9'), representing the golden ticket; `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`; `target_sum` is total_sum // 2, and the total sum of the digits in `ticket` is even**
