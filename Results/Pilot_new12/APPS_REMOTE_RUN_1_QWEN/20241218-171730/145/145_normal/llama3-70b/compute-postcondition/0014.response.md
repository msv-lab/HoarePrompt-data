The code `curr_sum += digit` increments the value of `curr_sum` by the value of `digit`. Since `digit` is a single digit from the `ticket` string, its value is between 0 and 9. However, the exact value of `digit` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `curr_sum`. But we know that `curr_sum` is updated by adding the current digit from the `ticket`.

The other variables (`total_sum`, `target_sum`, `ticket`, and `segments`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly `n` digits, `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is increased by the current digit from `ticket`, and `segments` equals either `1` or remains unchanged.**
