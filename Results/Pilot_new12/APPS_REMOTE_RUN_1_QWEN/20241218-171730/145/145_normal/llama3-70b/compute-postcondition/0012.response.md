Postcondition: ***`ticket` is a non-empty string of exactly n digits (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each digit is between '0' and '9'), `total_sum` is the sum of all digits in `ticket`, `target_sum` is total_sum // 2, `curr_sum` equals either `target_sum` or 0, and `segments` equals either 1 or remains unchanged.***

Explanation:
- If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `segments` is set to 1, and `curr_sum` becomes `target_sum`.
- Since there is no else part, if `curr_sum` does not equal `target_sum`, `segments` remains unchanged, and `curr_sum` stays at 0.
