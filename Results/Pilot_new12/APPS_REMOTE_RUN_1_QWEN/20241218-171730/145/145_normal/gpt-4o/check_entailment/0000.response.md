Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` assumes that the target sum is the sum of the first `segment_length - 1` digits, which is not necessarily correct. The program needs to check all possible ways to split the ticket into segments with equal sums, not just the first few digits.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
123456
```

The correct output should be "YES" because the ticket can be divided into "12", "34", and "56", where each segment sums to 3. However, the provided program will not correctly identify this case because it does not properly calculate the target sum for different segment lengths. 

To fix this, the program should iterate over all possible segment lengths and calculate the target sum dynamically for each segment length, checking if the entire ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums.
