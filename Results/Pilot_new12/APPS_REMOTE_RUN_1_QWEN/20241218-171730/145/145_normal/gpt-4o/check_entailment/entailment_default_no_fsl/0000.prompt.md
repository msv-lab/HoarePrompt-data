You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Functions with output description for each function:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `ticket` (a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive). It attempts to partition the digits of `ticket` into segments of varying lengths such that the sum of the digits in each segment is equal to a predetermined target sum. The target sum is calculated based on the first segment of the specified length.

The function iterates through all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`, calculating the target sum for each length. For each segment length, it calculates the current sum of the digits in the current segment and checks if it matches the target sum. If it does, it resets the current sum and increments the segment count. After processing all segments, if the current sum is zero and the segment count is greater than 1, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `n` is 2, the function will only check the first segment of length 1, which is always valid since the target sum will be the same as the single digit in the segment.
- If `n` is 1, the function should not execute because the precondition 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 is not met, but the function should handle this edge case by returning 'NO' immediately without entering the loop.
- The function assumes that the `segment_sum` function is defined elsewhere and correctly calculates the sum of the digits in the specified segment.

After the function concludes, the program state is that it either returns 'YES' if there exists at least one valid way to partition the `ticket` string into segments with equal sums, or 'NO' otherwise.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are both integers. The function also takes a string `ticket` consisting of `n` digits (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each digit is between `0` and `9`). The function calculates and returns the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end` inclusive. The function correctly handles the specified range of indices, ensuring that `start` and `end` are within the bounds of the string `ticket`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function will still execute the loop but will not include any digits in the sum since the range would be empty. If `start` or `end` are out of bounds (less than `0` or greater than or equal to the length of `ticket`), the function will raise an `IndexError` due to the slicing operation `ticket[i]` in the list comprehension.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
