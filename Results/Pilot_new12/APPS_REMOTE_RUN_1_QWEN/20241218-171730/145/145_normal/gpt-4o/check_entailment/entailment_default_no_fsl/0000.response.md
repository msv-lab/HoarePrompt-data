Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case when `n` is 1. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the ticket cannot be divided into segments with equal sums, so the function should return 'NO' immediately without entering the loop. However, the provided code does not check this condition, leading to incorrect results for inputs with `n` equal to 1. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5
```

The expected output is "NO", but the current implementation would not return anything, which is incorrect. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
