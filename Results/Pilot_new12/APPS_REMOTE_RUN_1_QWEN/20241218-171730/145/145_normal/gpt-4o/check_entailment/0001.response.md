Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in its approach to checking if the ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums. Specifically, the `func_1` function assumes that the first segment's sum (`target_sum`) is fixed based on the first `segment_length - 1` digits, but this is not necessarily valid for all possible divisions of the ticket. Additionally, the program does not ensure that the remaining digits after forming the initial segments can also form valid segments with the same sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
123456
```
The program will check for segment lengths from 1 to 5. When it checks for a segment length of 2, it calculates `target_sum` as `1+2=3`. However, it then tries to divide the rest of the digits `[3, 4, 5, 6]` into segments that also sum to 3, which is impossible.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible ways to split the ticket into multiple segments and ensuring that each segment sums to the same value. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to potential incorrect results.
