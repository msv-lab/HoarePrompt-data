You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` assumes that the target sum is the sum of the first `segment_length - 1` digits, which is not necessarily correct. The program needs to check all possible ways to split the ticket into segments with equal sums, not just the first few digits.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
123456
```

The correct output should be "YES" because the ticket can be divided into "12", "34", and "56", where each segment sums to 3. However, the provided program will not correctly identify this case because it does not properly calculate the target sum for different segment lengths. 

To fix this, the program should iterate over all possible segment lengths and calculate the target sum dynamically for each segment length, checking if the entire ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `segment_sum` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are both integers. The function also takes a string `ticket` consisting of `n` digits (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each digit is between `0` and `9`). The function calculates and returns the sum of the digits in the string `ticket` from index `start` to index `end` inclusive. The function correctly handles the specified range of indices, ensuring that `start` and `end` are within the bounds of the string `ticket`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function will still execute the loop but will not include any digits in the sum since the range would be empty. If `start` or `end` are out of bounds (less than `0` or greater than or equal to the length of `ticket`), the function will raise an `IndexError` due to the slicing operation `ticket[i]` in the list comprehension.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
