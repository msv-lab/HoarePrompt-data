`segment_count` is incremented by 1. The value of `segment_count` was initially `1`, so after the increment, it becomes `2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`target_sum` is the sum of the first `n - 1` elements in the list, `segment_length` is `n - 1`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `i` is `i_prev + 1` and is still less than `n`, and `n` is the length of the `ticket` list.**
