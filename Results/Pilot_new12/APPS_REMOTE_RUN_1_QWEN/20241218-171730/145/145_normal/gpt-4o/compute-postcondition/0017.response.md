The code `current_sum = 0` sets the variable `current_sum` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `current_sum`, which was the original value of `current_sum` plus the integer value of `ticket[i]`. The other variables (`segment_count`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i+1`**
