`segment_count` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `target_sum` and `segment_length` remain unchanged, and `current_sum` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `target_sum` is the sum of the segment from index 0 to `segment_length - 1`, `segment_length` remains unchanged, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0.

Output State: **`target_sum` is the sum of the segment from index 0 to `segment_length - 1`, `segment_length` remains unchanged, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0**
