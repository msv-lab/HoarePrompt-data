Postcondition: **`target_sum` remains unchanged, `segment_length` remains unchanged, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of times `current_sum` equals `target_sum` during the loop execution, `i` is `n` (the last index processed), and `n` is the length of the ticket list. Additionally, either `current_sum` is not equal to 0 or `segment_count` is not greater than 1**
