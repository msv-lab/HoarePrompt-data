The `segment_count` variable is incremented by 1. The initial values of `target_sum` and `segment_length` remain unchanged, `current_sum` is still 0, `segment_count` was 0 and now it is 1, `i` is 2, and `n` must be at least 1.

Output State: **`target_sum` remains unchanged, `segment_length` remains unchanged, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1**
