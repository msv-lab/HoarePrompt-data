The function accepts four parameters: `v_1` and `v_2` (both integers within the range [1, 100]), `t` (an integer within the range [2, 100]), and `d` (an integer within the range [0, 10]). It calculates the maximum and minimum speeds over a period of `t` units of time, where each unit of time `i` (from `t-1` down to 0) adjusts these speeds based on the decrement and increment by `d`. The function then prints the final maximum length traveled over the given time period.
