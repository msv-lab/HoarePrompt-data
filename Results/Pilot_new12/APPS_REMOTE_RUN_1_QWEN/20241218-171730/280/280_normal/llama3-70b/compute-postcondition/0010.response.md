The initial state is defined as follows:
- `v1` is an integer input
- `v2` is an integer input
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)
- `max_speed` is `max(v2 - d, v1)`
- `min_speed` is `min(v1 + d, v2 - d)`
- `min_length` is `min_speed * t`
- `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`

The code snippet is:
```python
min_length += min_speed
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code:
- `min_length` is initially `min_speed * t`.
- The code adds `min_speed` to `min_length`.

Therefore, the new value of `min_length` is:
\[ \text{min_length} = \text{min_speed} \times t + \text{min_speed} = \text{min_speed} \times (t + 1) \]

Other variables remain unchanged.

So, the output state is:
Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is `max(v2 - d, v1)`, `min_speed` is `min(v1 + d, v2 - d)`, `min_length` is `min_speed \times (t + 1)`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`.**
