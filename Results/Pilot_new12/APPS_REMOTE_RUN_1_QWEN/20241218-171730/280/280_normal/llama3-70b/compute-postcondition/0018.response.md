First, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State:
  - `v1` is an integer input
  - `v2` is an integer input
  - `t` must be greater than or equal to 2
  - `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)
  - `max_speed` is \(\max(\max(v2 - 2d, v1) - d, \min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d))\)
  - `min_speed` is \(\min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d)\)
  - `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`
  - `max_length` is `max_length + 2 * max_speed`
  - `i` is 1

- Code Snippet:
  ```
  min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
  ```

This line of code updates `min_speed` by taking the minimum between `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

Now, let's calculate the new state:

1. The value of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_length`, and `max_length` remain unchanged because the code only modifies `min_speed`.
2. The updated `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is \(\max(\max(v2 - 2d, v1) - d, \min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d))\), `min_speed` is \(\min(min_speed + d, max_speed)\), `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`, `max_length` is `max_length + 2 * max_speed`, `i` is 1**
