First, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

- Initial State: `v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is `max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`, `min_speed` is `min(v1, v2)`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`.
- Code Snippet: `min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`

Given the initial state, `max_speed` is calculated as `max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`. Since `min_speed` is initially `min(v1, v2)`, the code updates `min_speed` to be the minimum between `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

Let's denote the values as follows:
- Without loss of generality, assume \(v1 \leq v2\). Thus, `min_speed` is `v1`.
- Therefore, `max_speed` is `max(v2 - d, v1)`.

Now, the code updates `min_speed` to be `min(v1 + d, max(v2 - d, v1))`.

Since `v1 \leq v2`, there are two cases to consider:
1. If `v1 + d \leq v2 - d`, then `min_speed` remains `v1` because `v1` is smaller than or equal to `v1 + d` and also smaller than `v2 - d`.
2. If `v1 + d > v2 - d`, then `min_speed` becomes `v2 - d`.

In both cases, the value of `min_speed` after the code execution will be `v1` if `v1 + d \leq v2 - d` or `v2 - d` if `v1 + d > v2 - d`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is `max(v2 - d, v1)`, `min_speed` is `min(v1 + d, v2 - d)`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t`.**
