Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is the maximum speed reached after the loop, `min_speed` is the minimum speed reached after the loop, `min_length` is the final value of `min_length` after the loop, `max_length` is the final value of `max_length` after the loop, `i` is 0.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `v1` and `v2` are inputs.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\).
   - `max_speed` is initially \(\max(v1, v2)\).
   - `min_speed` is initially \(\min(v1, v2)\).
   - `min_length` is initially \(\min_speed \times t\).
   - `max_length` is initially 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from \(i = t - 1\) down to \(i = 1\).
   - For each iteration, the loop updates `max_speed` and `min_speed` as follows:
     - `max_speed = \max(\max_speed - d, \min_speed)`
     - `min_speed = \min(\min_speed + d, max_speed)`
   - It also updates `max_length` and `min_length` as follows:
     - `max_length += max_speed`
     - `min_length += min_speed`

3. **Final Values:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be 0.
   - `max_speed` will be the maximum speed reached during the loop.
   - `min_speed` will be the minimum speed reached during the loop.
   - `min_length` will be the cumulative sum of `min_speed` over the iterations.
   - `max_length` will be the cumulative sum of `max_speed` over the iterations.

4. **No Loop Execution:**
   - If \(t = 1\), the loop does not execute, and the initial values of the variables remain unchanged.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state of the variables will be as described above.
