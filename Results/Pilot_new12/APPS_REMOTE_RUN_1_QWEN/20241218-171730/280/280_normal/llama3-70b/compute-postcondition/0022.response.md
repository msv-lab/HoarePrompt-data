The code snippet `print(max_length)` only prints the value of `max_length` without changing any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the print statement which will display the current value of `max_length`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\), `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is the maximum speed reached after the loop, `min_speed` is the minimum speed reached after the loop, `min_length` is the final value of `min_length` after the loop, `max_length` is the final value of `max_length` after the loop, `i` is 0; and the value of `max_length` is printed.**
