First, let's analyze the given code and initial state:

- Initial State: `v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is \(\max(\max(v2 - 2d, v1) - d, \min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d))\), `min_speed` is \(\min(min_speed + d, max_speed)\), `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2)`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, `i` is 1.

The code provided is:
```
min_length += min_speed
```

This line updates the value of `min_length` by adding `min_speed` to it. Since `min_length` was initially defined as `min_speed * (t + 2)`, the new value of `min_length` will be `min_speed * (t + 2) + min_speed`.

Let's express this in terms of the variables:
- `min_length` is updated to `min_speed * (t + 2) + min_speed`.

Now, let's write the Output State:
Output State: **`v1` is an integer input, `v2` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\), `max_speed` is \(\max(\max(v2 - 2d, v1) - d, \min(\min(v1 + d, v2 - d) + d, \max(v2 - d, v1) - d))\), `min_speed` is \(\min(min_speed + d, max_speed)\), `min_length` is `min_speed * (t + 2) + min_speed`, `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, `i` is 1**
