Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) representing the initial and final speeds, respectively.
   - It then reads two more integers \(t\) and \(d\), where \(t\) is the duration in seconds and \(d\) is the maximum speed change between adjacent seconds.

2. **Speed Calculation**:
   - A list `speeds` of length \(t\) is initialized.
   - The first element of `speeds` is set to \(v_1\).
   - The last element of `speeds` is set to \(v_2\).
   - For each second from 1 to \(t-1\), the speed is calculated as the minimum of the previous speed plus \(d\) or \(v_2\) minus \((t - i - 1) \cdot d\). This ensures that the speed changes do not exceed \(d\) in absolute value and that the final speed matches \(v_2\).

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The total distance covered is calculated by summing up all the speeds in the `speeds` list.
   - The total distance is then printed.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Initial and Final Speeds**: The program correctly sets the first speed to \(v_1\) and the last speed to \(v_2\).
- **Speed Constraints**: The calculation of each intermediate speed ensures that the speed change between any two adjacent seconds does not exceed \(d\).
- **Total Distance Calculation**: The total distance is accurately calculated by summing up all the speeds over the \(t\) seconds.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs within the specified ranges. Therefore, the program is correct.
