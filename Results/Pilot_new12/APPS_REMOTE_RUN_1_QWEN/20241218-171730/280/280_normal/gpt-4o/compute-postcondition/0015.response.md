Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `v1` and `v2` (integers between 1 and 100), `t` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `d` (an integer between 0 and 10). It constructs a list `speeds` of length `t` where the first element is `v1` and the last element is `v2`. Each subsequent element in the list is calculated as the minimum of the previous speed plus `d` or `v2` minus `(t - i - 1) * d`. After constructing the list, the function calculates the total distance traveled by summing the elements in the `speeds` list and prints the result. The function handles the specified ranges for the inputs and ensures that the `speeds` list is correctly populated according to the given conditions. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code.**
