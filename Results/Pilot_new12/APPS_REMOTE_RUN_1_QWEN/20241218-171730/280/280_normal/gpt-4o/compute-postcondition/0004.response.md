The code `speeds[-1] = v2` updates the last element of the list `speeds` to `v2`. Given the initial state where `speeds` is a list of length `t` with the first element being `v1` and the rest being zeros, after executing the code, the last element (index `t-1`) will be updated to `v2`.

So, the updated `speeds` list will have its first element as `v1` and the rest of the elements (from index 1 to `t-2` and the last element `t-1`) as `v2`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer within the range [1, 100]; `v2` is an input integer within the range [1, 100]; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10; `speeds` is a list of `t` elements, where the first element is `v1` and the last element is `v2`, and the rest are zeros.**
