Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function accurately converts a number from a given base to its decimal representation. The main part of the program reads the inputs, calls `func_1` for both numbers, and compares their decimal values to output the correct symbol ('<', '>', or '='). The annotated version of the code supports this, indicating that the function `func_1` correctly processes the digits and base to compute the decimal value, and the main part of the program correctly uses these values for comparison. Since the examples provided and the logic implemented handle all specified cases correctly, and there are no edge cases or constraints violated, the program is indeed correct.
