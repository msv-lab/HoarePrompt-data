Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function and then compares them. The logic in the main part of the program is sound and handles the comparison as described in the problem statement. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected, converting the numbers accurately and comparing them without any apparent issues. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
