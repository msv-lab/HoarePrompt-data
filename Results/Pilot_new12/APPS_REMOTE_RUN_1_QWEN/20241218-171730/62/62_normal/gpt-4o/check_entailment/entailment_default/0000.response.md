Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases. It reads the input, converts both numbers to their decimal representations using the `func_1` function, and then compares the decimal values to determine the relationship between the two numbers. The function `func_1` accurately converts a number from a given base to its decimal form by iterating through each digit and applying the appropriate base multiplication. The program handles all the necessary steps as described in the problem statement and the output hints. Since the problem assumes valid inputs, the program is correct for every potential case given the constraints.
