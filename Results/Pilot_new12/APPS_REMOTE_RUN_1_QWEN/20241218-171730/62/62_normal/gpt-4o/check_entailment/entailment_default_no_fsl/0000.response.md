Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the bases \(b_x\) and \(b_y\) are equal. According to the problem description, the bases \(b_x\) and \(b_y\) are guaranteed to be different, but the code does not account for the possibility of them being the same. If the bases are the same, the program will still execute the comparison logic, which is not aligned with the problem constraints.

To fix this, you should add a condition at the beginning of the program to check if the bases are equal and handle that case explicitly. Here is the modified version of the code:

```python
(n, base_x) = map(int, input().split())
digits_x = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, base_y) = map(int, input().split())
digits_y = list(map(int, input().split()))

if base_x == base_y:
    # Handle the case where bases are the same
    if n > m:
        print('>')
    elif n < m:
        print('<')
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if digits_x[i] > digits_y[i]:
                print('>')
                break
            elif digits_x[i] < digits_y[i]:
                print('<')
                break
        else:
            print('=')
else:
    decimal_x = func_1(digits_x, base_x)
    decimal_y = func_1(digits_y, base_y)
    if decimal_x < decimal_y:
        print('<')
    elif decimal_x > decimal_y:
        print('>')
    else:
        print('=')

def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
    return decimal_value
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly handles the case where the bases are the same by comparing the lengths of the digit lists and the digits themselves.
