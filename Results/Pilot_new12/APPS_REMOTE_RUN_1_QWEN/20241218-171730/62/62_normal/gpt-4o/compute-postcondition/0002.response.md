`decimal_value` is assigned the value of `decimal_value * base + digit`. The initial state shows that `decimal_value` is 0, and `digits` is a list of integers. The code updates `decimal_value` based on the first element of `digits` (since `digits` must have at least one element), `base`, and the current `decimal_value`.

Given the initial state:
- `decimal_value` is 0
- `digits` is a list of integers

After executing the line of code:
- `decimal_value` is updated to `0 * base + digit`, where `digit` is the first element in the list `digits`.

Therefore, the new value of `decimal_value` is the first element of the list `digits`.

Output State: **`decimal_value` is the first element of the list `digits`, `digits` is a list of integers**
