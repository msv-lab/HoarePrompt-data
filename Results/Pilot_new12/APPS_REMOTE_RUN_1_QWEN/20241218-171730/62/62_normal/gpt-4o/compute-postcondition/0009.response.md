The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits`, which is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specific base, and `base`, which is an integer representing the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40). The list `digits` does not contain leading zeros, and all elements in `digits` are non-negative integers less than the base. After executing the function body, the function returns `decimal_value`, which is the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in the list `digits` using the specified base.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and return the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in `digits` using the specified base.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in `digits` using the specified base.**
