The code `result = result * base + digit` updates the value of `result`. The previous value of `result` is multiplied by `base` and then `digit` is added to the result. However, since the initial values of `result`, `base`, and `digit` are not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `result`. We can only state that `result` has been updated according to the formula.

Output State: **`result` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `base` plus `digit`, `base` is unchanged, `digit` is unchanged**
