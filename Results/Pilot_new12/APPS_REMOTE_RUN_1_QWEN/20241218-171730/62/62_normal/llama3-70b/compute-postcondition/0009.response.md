The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. `digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specific base, and `base` is an integer representing the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40). The length of `digits` corresponds to the number of digits of the number in that base. After executing the function body, the function returns `result`, which is the number represented by the list `digits` in the specified `base`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and return the number represented by `digits` in the specified `base`.
