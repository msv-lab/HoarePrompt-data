According to the code, the loop iterates over each `digit` in the `digits` list. The loop body updates the `result` by multiplying its current value by `base` and then adding `digit`. The `base` and `digit` values remain unchanged during each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `result` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `base` plus `digit`.
- `base` is unchanged.
- `digit` is unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `digit` variable needs to move to the next element in the `digits` list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `digit` has been incremented to the next value in the list.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `result` is updated based on the previous `digit`.
2. `base` remains unchanged.
3. `digit` moves to the next value in the `digits` list.

State: **`result` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `base` plus `digit`, `base` is unchanged, `digit` is the next value in the `digits` list**
