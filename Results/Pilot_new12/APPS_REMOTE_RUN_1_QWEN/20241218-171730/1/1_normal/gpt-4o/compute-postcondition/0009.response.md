`ind` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is 1, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is 1, `i` is 1**
