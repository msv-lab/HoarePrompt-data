`start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently set such that `s[i]` is `':'`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `ind + 1` is a valid index, `bind` is the last index of the string, `start_colon` is equal to `i` (which is such that `s[i]` is `':'`), and `i` is such that `s[i]` is `':'`.
