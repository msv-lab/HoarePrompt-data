`end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the same as the current value of `s[i]`, which is `':'`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind - 1` must be greater than or equal to `ind`, `end_colon` is `i` (which is the index of `':'` in the string `s`)**
