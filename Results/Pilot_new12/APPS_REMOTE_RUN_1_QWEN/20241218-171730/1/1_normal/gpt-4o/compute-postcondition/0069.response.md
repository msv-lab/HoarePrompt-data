To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `range(start_colon + 1, end_colon)`. This means the loop will execute if there is a valid range between `start_colon + 1` and `end_colon`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `ind` is not -1.
   - `bind` is not -1.
   - `ind` is less than `bind`.
   - `start_colon` remains unchanged.
   - `end_colon` is the index of the last `:` found in the substring from `ind + 1` to `bind` (or remains `-1` if no `:` is found).
   - `i` is `-1` if the loop does not execute, otherwise `i` is `ind + 1` if no `:` is found or `end_colon` if `s[i]` equals `':'`.
   - `start_colon` is not -1.
   - `end_colon` is not -1.
   - `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`.
   - `pipe_count` is 0.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute, `start_colon + 1` must be less than `end_colon`.
   - If `end_colon` is `-1`, then the loop will not execute because the range will be invalid (since `start_colon + 1` will not be less than `-1`).

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Ensure `end_colon` is not `-1`.
   - Ensure `start_colon + 1` is less than `end_colon`.

### Final State Adjustment:

The state before the loop should ensure that `end_colon` is not `-1` and `start_colon + 1` is less than `end_colon`.

**State:**
**`ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` remains unchanged, `end_colon` must not be -1 and must be greater than `start_colon`, `i` is `-1` if the loop does not execute, otherwise `i` is `ind + 1` if no `:` is found or `end_colon` if `s[i]` equals `':'`, `start_colon` is not -1, `end_colon` is not -1, and `start_colon` is less than `end_colon`, and `pipe_count` is 0.**
