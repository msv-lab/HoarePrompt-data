Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `ind` is the index of the first `[` in the string `s`. If the first character of `s` is `[`, `ind` is set to the index of this character. Otherwise, `ind` remains `-1` and unchanged.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, the loop body is executed.
   - After the loop body is executed, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next value.
   - `i` starts from `0` and increases by `1` in each iteration, so after the first iteration, `i` would be `1`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` does not change within the loop and remains the same as the length of `s`.
   - `ind` also does not change within the loop and remains the same as it was at the beginning of the loop.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be `1` after the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ind` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first `[` in the string `s`, and `i` is 1**.
