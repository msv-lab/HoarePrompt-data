The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `n`, `ind`, or `bind`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is -1, `bind` is the index of the last `]` character in the string `s` or -1 if there is no `]` in the string, and -1 is printed to the console.**
