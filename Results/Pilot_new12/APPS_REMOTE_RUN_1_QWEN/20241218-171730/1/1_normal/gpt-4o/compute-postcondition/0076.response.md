Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `s` is a string (unchanged).
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `start_colon` remains unchanged.
   - `end_colon` remains unchanged.
   - `pipe_count` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is a vertical bar (`|`). Otherwise, the values of `i`, `start_colon`, `end_colon`, and `pipe_count` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `start_colon + 1` to `end_colon` (exclusive).

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `start_colon` remains unchanged.
   - `end_colon` remains unchanged.
   - `pipe_count` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` was a vertical bar (`|`). Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

4. **For the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be within the range `[start_colon + 1, end_colon)`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `start_colon` remains unchanged.
   - `end_colon` remains unchanged.
   - `pipe_count` may or may not be increased by 1 depending on the value of `s[i]`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `s` remains a string.
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `start_colon` remains unchanged.
- `end_colon` remains unchanged.
- `pipe_count` remains unchanged unless `s[i]` was a vertical bar (`|`), but since we don't know the exact condition, we'll keep it as `pipe_count` unchanged for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, `start_colon` remains unchanged, `end_colon` remains unchanged, and `pipe_count` remains unchanged.**
