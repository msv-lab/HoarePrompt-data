The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ind`. The initial state of `s` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is an input string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters '[', ']', ':', and '|'; `n` is the length of `s`; `ind` is -1**
