Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given State:
- `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ind` is not -1.
- `bind` is not -1.
- `ind` is less than `bind`.
- `ind + 1` is a valid index.
- `bind` is the last index of the string.
- `start_colon` is equal to the index of the first `:` found in the substring from `ind + 1` to `bind`, or remains `-1` if no `:` is found.
- `end_colon` is -1.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(bind - 1, ind, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = bind - 1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i >= ind`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will run as long as `bind - 1` is greater than or equal to `ind`.

3. **Current States:**
   - `ind` is not -1.
   - `bind` is not -1.
   - `ind` is less than `bind`.
   - `bind` is the last index of the string, so `bind` is valid.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `bind` is the last index of the string, `bind - 1` will always be valid as long as `bind` is valid.
   - To ensure the loop runs, we need `bind - 1` to be greater than or equal to `ind`.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state such that the loop condition is met. 

### Final State:
- `ind` is not -1.
- `bind` is not -1.
- `ind` is less than `bind`.
- `bind - 1` must be greater than or equal to `ind`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ind` is not -1, `bind` is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind - 1` must be greater than or equal to `ind`**
