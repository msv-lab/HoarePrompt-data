Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `bind - 2`
   - `ind` remains the same
   - `bind` remains the same
   - `end_colon` is set to `bind - 2` if `s[i]` equals `':'`; otherwise, `end_colon` remains the same as the previous state.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop runs for `i` in the range from `bind - 1` to `ind` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` decreases from `bind - 1` to `ind`.

3. **Current Value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `bind - 2`.

4. **Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the next value of `i` will be `bind - 3`.

5. **Loop Execution Criteria**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than or equal to `ind`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `bind - 2`, so for the next iteration, `i` needs to be `bind - 3` and must still be greater than or equal to `ind`.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - `ind` remains the same.
   - `bind` remains the same.
   - `end_colon` remains the same as the previous state because the condition `s[i] == ':'` would only affect `end_colon` when `i` was `bind - 2`, and since `i` is now `bind - 3`, `end_colon` does not change.

7. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is `bind - 3`
   - `ind` remains the same
   - `bind` remains the same
   - `end_colon` remains the same as the previous state

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `bind - 3`, `ind` remains the same, `bind` remains the same, and `end_colon` remains the same as the previous state.**
