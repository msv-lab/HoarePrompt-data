The code `end_colon = i` assigns the value of `i` to `end_colon`. Given the initial state where `i` is `bind - 3`, `ind`, `bind`, and `end_colon` remain unchanged, the value of `end_colon` is updated to match the value of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `bind - 3`, `ind` remains the same, `bind` remains the same, and `end_colon` is `bind - 3`.**
