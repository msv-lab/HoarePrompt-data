Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` can be any integer value (or -1 if there is no `[`), `bind` is `n - 3`, `i` is `n - 3`. If `s[i]` is `]`, then the character `s[i]` remains unchanged. There is no change in `ind`, `bind`, or `i` since the else part does not alter these variables.***
