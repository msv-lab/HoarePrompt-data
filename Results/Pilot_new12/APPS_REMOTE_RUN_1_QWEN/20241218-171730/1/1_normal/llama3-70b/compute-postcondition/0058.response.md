Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first `:` after the first `[` in the string, `f` is `False`, and `bind` is `-1`. If the loop did not find a `':'` following a `']'`, `f` remains `False` and `bind` remains `-1`. If the loop finds a `':'` following a `']'`, `f` becomes `True` and `bind` is set to the index of the `':'`. The condition `(ind == -1 or bind == -1)` is satisfied.**
