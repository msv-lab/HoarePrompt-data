Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no two distinct numbers appear exactly `n//2` times. This is evident in the third example provided:

- Input:
```
6
10
20
30
20
10
20
```

- Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs:
```
YES
10 20
```

This happens because the program checks if there exists a number that appears exactly `n//2` times and considers it valid if found, without ensuring that the other number also appears exactly `n//2` times. Therefore, it fails to correctly identify cases where no such pair of numbers exists, leading to incorrect results.
