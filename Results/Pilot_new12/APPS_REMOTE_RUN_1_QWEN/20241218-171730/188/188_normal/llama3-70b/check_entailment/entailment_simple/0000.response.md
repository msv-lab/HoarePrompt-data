Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider cases where it is impossible to distribute all cards equally between Petya and Vasya, even though they choose different integers. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - The program correctly checks if there are two distinct integers that appear exactly `n/2` times in the list `a`. If such integers exist, it prints "YES" followed by those two integers.
   - However, the program does not handle cases where no such pair exists, or where it is impossible to distribute all cards equally (even if such pairs exist).

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Case 1**: No Pair Exists
     - If no two distinct integers appear exactly `n/2` times, the program incorrectly prints "NO", which is correct according to the problem statement. However, this case alone does not fully cover all possible invalid scenarios.
   - **Case 2**: All Cards Cannot Be Distributed Equally
     - The program does not check if it is possible to distribute all cards between Petya and Vasya. For example, if one integer appears `n/2 + 1` times and another appears `n/2 - 1` times, the total number of cards is still even, but it's impossible to distribute them equally. The program does not account for this scenario.

3. **Example Scenarios**:
   - **Example 3**: 
     ```
     Input:
     6
     10
     20
     30
     20
     10
     20
     
     Output:
     NO
     ```
     - Here, the program correctly identifies that no two distinct integers appear exactly `n/2` times and prints "NO". This is correct.

   - **Example 4**: 
     ```
     Input:
     6
     1
     1
     2
     2
     3
     3
     
     Output:
     NO
     ```
     - Here, the program should recognize that although the counts are symmetric, it is impossible to choose two distinct integers that allow Petya and Vasya to take all cards equally. The program does not handle this case correctly and prints "NO".

To fix the program, additional logic is needed to ensure that if no two distinct integers appear exactly `n/2` times, it should also check if the distribution is impossible due to uneven card counts for any integer.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))

    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1

    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if a1 == -1:
                a1 = i
            elif a2 == -1:
                a2 = i
            else:
                break
    
    if a1 != -1 and a2 != -1:
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    elif len(d) < 2:  # Case where no two distinct integers exist
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all edge cases as required by the problem description.
