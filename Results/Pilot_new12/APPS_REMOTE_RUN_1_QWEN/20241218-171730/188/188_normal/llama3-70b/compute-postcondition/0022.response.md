`d[i]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `i` is the third element of the list `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is an integer. The dictionary `d` is updated such that the key `i` is associated with the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `a`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` set to `1`, `total` is undefined, and `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive**
