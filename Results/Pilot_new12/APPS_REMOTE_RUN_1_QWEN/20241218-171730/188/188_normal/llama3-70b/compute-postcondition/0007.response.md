`a` is appended with an integer entered via input(). The length of `a` is now 2 because it originally contained one element. The value of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `total` is still undefined. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the integer entered via input(), `i` is 2, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `total` is undefined.
Output State: **`a` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the integer entered via input(), `i` is 2, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `total` is undefined**
