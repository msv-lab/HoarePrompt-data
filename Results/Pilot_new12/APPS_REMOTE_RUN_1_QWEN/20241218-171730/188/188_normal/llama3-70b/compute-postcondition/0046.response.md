`c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0, 1, or 2 to 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_old + 1`, `n` is an integer, `c` is 1, 2, or 3, `a1` is `i_old + 1`, `a2` is as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**
