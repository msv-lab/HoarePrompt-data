Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `a` is a list of length `n` containing integers entered via input().
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.
   - `total` is undefined.
   - `d` is an empty dictionary.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   The for loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the variable `i` (which is used as the iterator) must be an iterable, meaning `a` should contain elements that can be iterated over.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is currently set to `n`, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be an element from the list `a` for the loop to execute.
   - The loop will start iterating when `i` takes on the values of the elements in `a`.

5. **Final States Required for the Loop to Execute:**
   - `a` must be a non-empty list because if `a` is empty, there are no elements to iterate over, and the loop won't execute.
   - `i` must be initialized to the first element of the list `a` for the loop to start executing.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must be a non-empty list.
- `i` must be initialized to the first element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the final state required for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the first element of `a`, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `total` is undefined, `d` is an empty dictionary**
