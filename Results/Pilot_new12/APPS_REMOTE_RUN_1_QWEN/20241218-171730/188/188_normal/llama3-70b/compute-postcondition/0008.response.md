Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n` containing integers entered via input(), `i` is `n`, `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, `total` is undefined.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times because `i` is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration (`i in range(n)`).
- Each iteration appends an integer input to the list `a`.
- After `n` iterations, the list `a` will have `n` elements, each being an integer input.
- Since the loop runs `n` times, `i` will be equal to `n` at the end of the loop.
- The condition that `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive remains unchanged.
- The variable `total` is never used within the loop and remains undefined after the loop completes.
