The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with key `i` in dictionary `d` by 1. Here, `i` is the third element of the list `a`. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the value of `total` remains undefined, `n` remains an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive, and `d` is updated such that the value associated with the key `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `a`, `d` is a dictionary where the value of the key `i` is incremented by 1, `total` is undefined, and `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 inclusive.**
