The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an even number and is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, after executing this line of code, `n` will retain its even value within this range, but the exact value is not known since it depends on user input.

Other variables are not affected by this code, so their states remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an even number and is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and `n` is assigned the value of an integer input.**
