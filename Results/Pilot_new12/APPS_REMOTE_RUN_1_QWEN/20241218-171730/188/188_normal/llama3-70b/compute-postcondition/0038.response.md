`a1` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is increased by 1, which means the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. The states of the other variables (`d`, `n`, `c`, `a1`, `a2`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`d` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `c` is 0 or 1, `a1` is `i`, `a2` is as it was at the end of the previous iteration**
