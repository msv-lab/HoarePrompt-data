The code assigns the value of `i` to `a2`. The previous value of `i` is `i_old`, which means `a2` is now updated to the current value of `i`. Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`d` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `c` is 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is `i_old`, `a2` is equal to the current value of `i`.**
