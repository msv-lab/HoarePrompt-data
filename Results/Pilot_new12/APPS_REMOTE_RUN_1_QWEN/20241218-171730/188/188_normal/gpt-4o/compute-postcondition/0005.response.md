The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is that the string 'NO' is printed. The values of the variables `n`, `cards`, `count`, and `unique_numbers` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `count` is a Counter object where each key is an integer from the list `cards` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique numbers from `cards`, sorted by their frequency in descending order, and the string 'NO' is printed to the console.**
