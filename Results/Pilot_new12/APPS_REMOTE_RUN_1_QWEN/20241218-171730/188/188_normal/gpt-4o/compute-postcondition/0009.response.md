The code prints the last two elements of the `unique_numbers` list. These two elements are the most frequent numbers in the `cards` list, each appearing exactly `n // 2` times. The print statement does not change any variable values but outputs the values of the last two elements in `unique_numbers`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `count` is a Counter object where each key is an integer from the list `cards` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique numbers from `cards`, sorted by their frequency in descending order, and the last two elements in `unique_numbers` are present exactly `n // 2` times each in `cards`, a string 'YES' has been printed to the console, and the last two elements of `unique_numbers` are printed.**
