`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will now hold an integer input from the user. The value of `n` will be an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The list of `n` integers is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**
