Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, and `op` can be one of the following: 'U', 'R', 'L', or any other character. If `op` is 'U', `uy` is `uy_initial + 1`. If `op` is 'D', `uy` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', `ux` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'L', `ux` is set to `ux_initial - 1`. Otherwise, the value of `op` remains unchanged.***
