Postcondition: ***`dx`, `dy`, `res`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `op` are as follows: if `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `res` is 6, `ops` remains unchanged, and `ux` and `uy` remain 10, `op` remains 'U'. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `res` is 6, and `ops` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `res` is 7, and `ops` remains unchanged, `ux` and `uy` remain 10, and `op` remains 'U'.***
