According to the given code, the loop iterates over each operation in `ops`. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `dx`, `dy`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `res`, `op` are as defined.
- If the current operation `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, if the current operation is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is incremented by 1.
- If the current operation is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1.
- If the current operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is incremented by 1 and `res` is set to 0.
- Otherwise, `res` is set to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next operation `op` from the list `ops` must be processed. This means that the variable `op` will be updated to the next operation in the list `ops`.

Since we don't know the specific value of `op` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to consider the general conditions under which the loop continues:

1. The loop continues as long as there are more operations in `ops` to process.
2. The variables `dx`, `dy`, `ux`, `uy`, `res` will be updated based on the current operation `op`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that `op` is set to the next operation in the list `ops`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `op` will be set to the next operation in `ops`.
- `dx`, `dy`, `ux`, `uy`, `res` will be updated based on the new value of `op`.

However, since we do not have the specific values of `dx`, `dy`, `ux`, `uy`, `res`, and `op` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only generalize that `op` will be the next operation in `ops`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`dx`, `dy`, `ops` (next operation), `ux`, `uy`, `res`, `op` (next operation)**
