The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning them to the variables `x` and `y`. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the variable `ops` is not affected.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input provided by the user such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`; `ops` is a string consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' characters; `x` is an integer input provided by the user; `y` is an integer input provided by the user**
