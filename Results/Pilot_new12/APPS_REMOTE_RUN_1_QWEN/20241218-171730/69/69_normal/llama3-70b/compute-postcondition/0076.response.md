The code `dx += 1` increments the value of `dx` by 1. Given that the initial value of `dx` is 1, the new value of `dx` will be 2. The states of the other variables (`dy`, `res`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, and `op`) are not affected.

Output State: **`dx` is 2, `dy` is 1, `res` is 6, `ops` is ['R', 'L'], `ux` is 10, `uy` is 10, `op` is 'U'**
