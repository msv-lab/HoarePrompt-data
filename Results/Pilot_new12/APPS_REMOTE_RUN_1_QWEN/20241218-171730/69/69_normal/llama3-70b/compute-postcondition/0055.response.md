The code `dx += 1` increments the value of `dx` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `dx` was initially `x - ux` and is now less than 0. After adding 1 to `dx`, `dx` will be `x - ux + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is `x - ux + 1`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `res` is `0`, `op` is the current operation in `ops` and equals 'L', `dx` is now less than 0 (became `x - ux + 1`), the index of the current operation in `ops` is 0, and `op` is not 'U', and `dy` is greater than or equal to 0**
