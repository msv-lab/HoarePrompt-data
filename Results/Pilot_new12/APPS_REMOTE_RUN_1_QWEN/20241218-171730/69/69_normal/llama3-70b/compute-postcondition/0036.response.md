Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, and `op` can be one of the following: 'U', 'R', 'L', or any other character. If `op` is 'D', `uy` is decremented by 1. If `op` is 'R', `ux` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'L', `ux` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, there is no change in `ux` and `uy`.***
