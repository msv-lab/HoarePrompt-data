`ops` is assigned the value of the string input provided by the user. The sequence of operations is a string consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' characters. The values of `n`, the sequence of operations, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input provided by the user such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, the sequence of operations `ops` is a string consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' characters, and the target coordinates (x, y) are integers such that `-10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input provided by the user such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `ops` is a string consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' characters, and the target coordinates (x, y) are integers such that `-10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`.**
