The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of `res` but does not change the value of `res` itself. The other variables (`dx`, `dy`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`dx` is the net horizontal displacement, `dy` is the net vertical displacement, `ops` is the original operations string, `ux` is `x - dx`, `uy` is `y - dy`, `res` is the count of invalid operations.**
