`dy` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is `dy + 1`, `ops` (next operation) is unchanged, `ux` is unchanged, `uy` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `op` (next operation) is unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is unchanged, `dy` is `dy + 1`, `ops` (next operation) is unchanged, `ux` is unchanged, `uy` is unchanged, `res` is unchanged, `op` (next operation) is unchanged.**
