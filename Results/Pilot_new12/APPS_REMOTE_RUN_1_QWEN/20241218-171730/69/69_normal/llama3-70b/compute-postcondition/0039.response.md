The code assigns the difference between the current coordinates `x` and `ux` to `dx`, and the difference between the current coordinates `y` and `uy` to `dy`. However, the initial values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express `dx` and `dy` in terms of `x`, `y`, `ux`, and `uy`.

Output State: **`dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`.**
