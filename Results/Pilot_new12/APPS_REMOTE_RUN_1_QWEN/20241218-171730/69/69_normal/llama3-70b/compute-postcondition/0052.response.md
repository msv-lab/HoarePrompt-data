`dx` is decremented by 1. The value of `dx` was `x - ux`, and since `dx` is greater than 0, after decrementing by 1, `dx` will be `x - ux - 1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dx` is `x - ux - 1`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `res` is `0`, the current operation in `ops` is 'R', `dx` is greater than `0`, and `dy` is greater than or equal to `0`**
