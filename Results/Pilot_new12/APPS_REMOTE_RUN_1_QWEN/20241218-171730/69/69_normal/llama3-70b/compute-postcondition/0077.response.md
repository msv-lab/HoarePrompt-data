The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` is 6, so after executing this line, `res` will be 7. The values of the other variables (`dx`, `dy`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, and `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is 1, `dy` is 1, `res` is 7, `ops` is `['R', 'L']`, `ux` is 10, `uy` is 10, `op` is 'U'**
