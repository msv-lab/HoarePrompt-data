According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `op`. The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the string `ops`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ops` is a non-empty string, and `op` can be one of the following: 'U', 'R', 'L', or any other character. 

- If `op` is 'U', `uy` is updated to `uy_initial + 1`.
- If `op` is 'D', `uy` is decreased by 1.
- If `op` is 'R', `ux` is incremented by 1.
- If `op` is 'L', `ux` is set to `ux_initial - 1`.
- Otherwise, the value of `op` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the string `ops` must be one of the valid operations ('U', 'R', 'L') or any other character, but the string `ops` itself must still be non-empty.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, and `op` can be one of the following: 'U', 'R', 'L', or any other character**.
