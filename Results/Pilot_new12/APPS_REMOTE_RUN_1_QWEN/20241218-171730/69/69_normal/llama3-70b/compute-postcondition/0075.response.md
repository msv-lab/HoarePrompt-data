The code `dx -= 1` decreases the value of `dx` by 1. Initially, `dx` is 1, so after this operation, `dx` will be 0. The values of the other variables (`dy`, `res`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, and `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is 0, `dy` is 1, `res` is 6, `ops` is `['R', 'L']`, `ux` is 10, `uy` is 10, `op` is 'U'**
