The code `dy -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `dy`. Given that `dy` was initially greater than 0, after executing this line, `dy` will still be positive but will now be one less than its initial value. The states of the other variables (`dx`, `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `res`, and `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy - 1`, `ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is the final x-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `uy` is the final y-coordinate after processing all operations in `ops`, `res` is `0`, `op` is the current operation 'U'**
