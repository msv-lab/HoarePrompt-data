The code updates the `position_map` by setting `position_map[current_x, current_y]` to `i`. Given that `i` is currently 2, this means `position_map[current_x, current_y]` will be set to 2.

The other variables (`min_length`, `position_map`, `target_pos`) remain unchanged from their initial or updated states as per the precondition.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `2 - position_map[target_pos]`, `position_map[current_x, current_y]` is 2, `target_pos` is `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`.**
