Postcondition: ***`dx` is `x - final_x`, `final_x` is the number of 'R' operations minus the number of 'L' operations, `final_y` is the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is set to `float('inf')`, `current_x` is 1, `current_y` is 0; `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1}`; `operations[i]` is not 'L'; at this point in the execution, `operations[i] == 'R''.***

Explanation:
- The if part sets `current_x` to 1 when `operations[i] == 'R'`.
- There is no else part, so the postcondition directly follows from the if part.
