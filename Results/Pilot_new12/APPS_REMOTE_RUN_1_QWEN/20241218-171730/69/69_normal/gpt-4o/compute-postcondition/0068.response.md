The code `current_y += 1` increments the value of `current_y` by 1. Since the initial value of `current_y` is based on `operations[0]`, and no specific value is given for `operations[0]`, we can only say that `current_y` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `current_y` is `current_y` + 1, `current_x` and `current_y` are adjusted based on `operations[0]`, `position_map` includes {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1}, `target_pos` is `(new_current_x + dx, new_current_y + dy)`**
