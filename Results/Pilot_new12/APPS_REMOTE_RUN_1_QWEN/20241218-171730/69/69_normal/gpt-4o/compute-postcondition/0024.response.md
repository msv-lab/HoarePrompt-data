Postcondition: ***`final_x` is either -2, 0, or 1, depending on the initial value of `final_x` and the operation 'L'. If `final_x` was -1, it becomes -2; if it was 1, it becomes 0. `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D', and 0 otherwise. `operations` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining. `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.***
