Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`
   - `position_map` includes either `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1}` or `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1}` depending on the value of `operations[i]`
   - `(current_x, current_y)` is added to `position_map` with the value `i`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`.

3. **What Needs to Change for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, for the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1, making `i = 2`.
   - The value of `min_length` remains unchanged as it was already updated based on the previous state.
   - The `position_map` needs to include the new key-value pair for the new position `(current_x, current_y)` with the value `2`.
   - The condition for the next iteration of the loop is that `i < n`, so `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:
- `i` is 2
- `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`
- `position_map` includes either `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1}` or `{(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1}` depending on the value of `operations[1]` and now also includes `{(current_x, current_y): 2}`
- `(current_x, current_y)` is added to `position_map` with the value `2`

The final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, `position_map` includes either {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1} depending on the value of `operations[1]` and now also includes {(current_x, current_y): 2}, and `(current_x, current_y)` is added to `position_map` with the value `2`**
