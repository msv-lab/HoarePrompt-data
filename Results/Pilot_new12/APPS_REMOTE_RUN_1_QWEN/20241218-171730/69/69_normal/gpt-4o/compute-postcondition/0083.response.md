The code `current_x -= 1` decrements the value of `current_x` by 1. The value of `current_y` remains unchanged, and the values of `min_length`, `position_map`, and `operations` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `1 - position_map[target_pos]`, `position_map` includes either {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y): 1} or {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x - 1, new_current_y - 1): 1} depending on the value of `operations[1]` and now also includes {(current_x - 1, current_y): 2}, and `(current_x - 1, current_y)` is added to `position_map` with the value `2`**
