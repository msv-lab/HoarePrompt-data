`current_y` is decremented by 1. The value of `current_x` remains unchanged, and the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state is: `i` is 1; `current_x` is adjusted based on `operations[0]`; `current_y` is adjusted based on `operations[0]` and decreased by 1; `position_map` includes {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y - 1): 1}; `target_pos` is `(new_current_x + dx, new_current_y + dy)`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `current_x` is adjusted based on `operations[0]`; `current_y` is adjusted based on `operations[0]` and decreased by 1; `position_map` includes {(0, 0): -1, (new_current_x, new_current_y - 1): 1}; `target_pos` is `(new_current_x + dx, new_current_y + dy)`**
