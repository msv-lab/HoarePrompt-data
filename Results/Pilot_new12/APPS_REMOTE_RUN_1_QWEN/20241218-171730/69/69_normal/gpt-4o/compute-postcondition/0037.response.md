`dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`. The values of `x`, `final_x`, `final_y`, `operations`, and `y` are updated accordingly. The output state is: `dx` is `x - final_x`, `final_x` is the number of 'R' operations minus the number of 'L' operations, `final_y` is the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
