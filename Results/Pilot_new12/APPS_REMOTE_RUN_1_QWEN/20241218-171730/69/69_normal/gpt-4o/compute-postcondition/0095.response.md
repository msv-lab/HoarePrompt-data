The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).

The function returns:

- **Case 1:** 0
- **Case 2:** The minimum value of \(i - \text{position\_map}[\text{target\_pos}]\) for any target_pos found in position_map during the loop execution, where \(\text{min\_length}\) is not infinity, else it returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a string `operations`, and two integers `x` and `y`. Based on the operations and initial positions, the function either returns 0 or the minimum value of the difference between the index and the mapped position, considering certain conditions.
