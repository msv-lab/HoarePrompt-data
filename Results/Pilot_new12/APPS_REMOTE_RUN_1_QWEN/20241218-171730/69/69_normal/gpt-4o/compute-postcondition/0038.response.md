The code `dy = y - final_y` assigns the value of `y - final_y` to `dy`. Given the initial state:

- `dx` is `x - final_x`
- `final_x` is the number of 'R' operations minus the number of 'L' operations
- `final_y` is the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations
- `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'
- `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5

After executing the code, the value of `dy` is updated to `y - final_y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is `x - final_x`, `final_x` is the number of 'R' operations minus the number of 'L' operations, `final_y` is the number of 'U' operations minus the number of 'D' operations, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `dy` is `y - final_y`.**
