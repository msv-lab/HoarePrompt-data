Postcondition: ***`final_x` is either -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2; `final_y` is -1 if the next operation is 'D' or 0 otherwise; `operations` is a non-empty string with at least two characters remaining; `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. The value of `final_x` is updated based on the condition of the if statement: if `op == 'R'`, `final_x` is set to either -1, 0, 1, or 2. Otherwise, the value of `final_x` remains unchanged.***
