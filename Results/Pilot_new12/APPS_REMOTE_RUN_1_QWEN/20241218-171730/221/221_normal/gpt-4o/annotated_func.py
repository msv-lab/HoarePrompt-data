#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are integers such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and does not return anything. It performs bitwise XOR operations on the variable `b` using `a` and `x`. Specifically, it first sets `a` to the result of `b ^ x`, then sets `b` to the result of `a ^ x`. After the function concludes, `a` and `b` are updated based on these operations, but the function itself does not return any values. Given the initial constraints `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`, the function manipulates `a` and `b` within these bounds without affecting `s`. There are no return postconditions mentioned, and the function does not directly modify `s`.
