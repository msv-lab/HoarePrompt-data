`s` and `x` are assigned the values obtained from the `input().split()` method, which converts each input value into an integer. Since the input values are split by default on whitespace, `s` and `x` will each hold one of the integer values entered by the user. The original conditions 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^12 and 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^12 remain valid.

Output State: **`s` is an integer between 2 and 10^12 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 inclusive**
