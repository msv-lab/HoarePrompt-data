Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the cursor is already within the range [l, r] but not exactly at position `l` or `r`. Let's consider the following case:

### Example Case
Input:
```
5 3 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- Initial state: Tabs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are open. Cursor is at tab 3.
- Step 1: Move cursor to tab 2.
- Step 2: Close all tabs to the right of tab 2 (tabs 3, 4, 5).

However, the provided program will output `5` because it calculates the distance to `l` or `r` and then adds the operation to close the remaining tabs, which is not optimal in this case.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Cursor Position and Range**: The cursor is at position `3`, and the target range is `[2, 4]`.
2. **Close Operation**: Moving to tab `2` and then closing all tabs to the right of tab `2` would be more efficient than moving to `l` or `r` and then closing all tabs.

The provided program does not account for the most efficient sequence of operations in such scenarios, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
