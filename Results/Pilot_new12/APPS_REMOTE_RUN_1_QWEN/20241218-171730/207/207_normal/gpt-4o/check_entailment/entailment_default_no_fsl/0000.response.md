Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the code is correct for every potential case:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. This is essential for simplifying the problem when the GCD of `a` and `b` is greater than 1.

2. **Recursive Simplification**: When the GCD of `m`, `a`, and `b` is not 1, the function `func_2` reduces the problem by dividing `m`, `a`, and `b` by their GCD and multiplying the result by the GCD. This ensures that the problem is simplified to its coprime form, making it easier to solve.

3. **Base Case**: When `m` is less than `k` (where `k = a + b - 1`), the function directly returns the sum of the first `m + 1` integers. This is the base case for the recursive approach.

4. **General Case**: For larger values of `m`, the function calculates two parts: the sum of the first `k` integers and the difference between the sum of the first `m` integers and the sum of the first `k-1` integers. These parts are then combined to give the final result.

Given the above points, the code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
