Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the required functionality. The main issue lies in how the function `func_2` calculates the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`. Specifically, the logic used to compute the sum of reachable positions up to `k` and beyond `k` is flawed.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the function:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
2. **Recursive Call**: The function makes a recursive call to handle the case where `a` and `b` are coprime (`g == 1`), which is a good approach.
3. **Sum Calculation**: However, the sum calculation part is incorrect. It assumes that the reachable set forms an arithmetic sequence with the GCD `g`, but this is not always true, especially when considering the boundaries `[0, x]`.

To illustrate the flaw, consider the following input:
- For `m = 10`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`:
  - The function will incorrectly calculate the sum as if the reachable set forms an arithmetic sequence, which is not accurate.

A more accurate approach would involve dynamically tracking the reachable positions within the interval `[0, m]` and counting the distinct positions. This would require a more complex algorithm that iteratively builds the set of reachable positions and ensures no duplicates are added.

Since the provided code does not correctly handle all cases, particularly the dynamic tracking of reachable positions, it is deemed incorrect.
