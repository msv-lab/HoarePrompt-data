Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the program. The function `func_2` attempts to reduce the problem size using the GCD and then calculates the sum based on certain conditions. However, the core logic for calculating the sum of reachable positions within the interval `[0, x]` is flawed. 

The output hints confirm that the function handles the GCD reduction and boundary conditions correctly, but the sum calculation part is still incorrect. Specifically, the function assumes that the reachable set forms an arithmetic sequence, which is not always true given the constraints and nature of the problem. The dynamic tracking of reachable positions and ensuring no duplicates are added is missing, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate, and the program is not correctly implementing the required functionality.
