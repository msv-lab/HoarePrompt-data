The code snippet `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` impacts the value of `dp[i + a]`. Initially, `i` is 1 and `m` is within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\). However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet, we cannot determine the exact value of `i + a`. Therefore, the value of `dp[i + a]` is increased by `dp[i]`, which is `dp[1]`.

The state of `i` and `m` remains unchanged because they are not directly affected by the given code. Thus, the updated information includes the new value of `dp[i + a]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `dp[i + a]` is `dp[1]` plus its original value.**
