The code `m, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `m`, `a`, and `b` respectively. Since the initial states of `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, the values of these variables are updated to the integers read from the input. However, the exact values of `m`, `a`, and `b` depend on the user's input.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^5, `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^5**
