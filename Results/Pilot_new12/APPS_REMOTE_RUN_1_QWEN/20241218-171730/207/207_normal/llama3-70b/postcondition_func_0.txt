The function processes three integer inputs \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\) where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` of length \(m+1\) where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach index `i` by either adding `a` or subtracting `b` from previous indices, starting with `dp[0] = 1`. After the for loop, the function prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, which indicates the total number of ways to reach any index up to `m` using the given operations. If `a > m` or `b > m`, the corresponding operations are not performed, and the initial `dp` values remain unchanged. If `b > m`, the subtraction operation is effectively ignored for indices less than `b`.
