The code `print(max_num)` does not change any variables; it only prints the value of `max_num`. The other variables (`max_sum` and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the print statement and the fact that `max_num` retains its previous value.

Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum digit sum of any integer between 1 and `x`, `max_num` is the integer between 1 and `x` that has this maximum digit sum, and the value of `max_num` is printed.**
