Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop:**
   - `i`: The current number being processed.
   - `x`: The upper limit of the range, which is defined as `x + 1`.
   - `digit_sum`: The sum of the digits of `i`.
   - `max_sum`: The maximum sum of digits encountered so far.
   - `max_num`: The number whose digits sum up to `max_sum`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - `i` is its original value.
   - If `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum` and `max_num` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1` (exclusive), so the loop will continue if `i < x + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x + 1`.

Given the above points, let's update the states:

- The new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- `digit_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_num` remain the same unless the loop updates them.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i+1`, `i` is `i+1`, `max_sum` remains the same, `max_num` remains the same.**

In a more structured format:

State: **`digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_sum` remains unchanged, `max_num` remains unchanged**
