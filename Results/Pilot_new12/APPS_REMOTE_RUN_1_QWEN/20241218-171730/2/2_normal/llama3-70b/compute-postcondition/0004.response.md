The given code snippet calculates the sum of digits of a number stored in the variable `i`. However, the code itself does not assign any value to `i`, nor does it print or return any value. It only contains a line that computes the sum of digits of `i` and assigns it to `digit_sum`.

Since the code does not change the value of `i` or any other variables directly, the initial state remains unchanged. The only change is the computation of `digit_sum`, which is not explicitly stated in the initial state. Given the nature of the problem, we can infer that `digit_sum` now holds the sum of the digits of `i`.

Output State: **`digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i`, `i` is its original value**
