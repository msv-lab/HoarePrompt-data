You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where solving additional subtasks after completing all tasks is possible within the remaining time. Specifically, the program breaks out of the loop when `time_used` exceeds `M`, but it does not consider whether solving more subtasks from the incomplete tasks could yield more points.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 4 15
1 2 3 4
```

- Completing all 3 tasks gives \(3 \times (4 + 1) = 15\) points, which exactly matches the available time.
- However, if we solve one more subtask from the third task, we get an additional point since the time taken (1 minute) is less than the remaining time (1 minute).

The correct output should be 16 points, but the current implementation will output 15 points because it does not account for this scenario.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        
        if time_used > M:
            break

        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\); `complete_tasks` is an integer such that \(0 \leq complete_tasks \leq n\); `max_points` is the maximum value achieved by updating `max_points` to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`; `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed`, and `t` remain as per their initial conditions; `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and \((n - complete_tasks) * k\).
    return max_points
    #The program returns max_points, which is the maximum value achieved by updating max_points to be the maximum of its current value and points + subtasks_solved, with subtasks_solved being the minimum of its original value and (n - complete_tasks) * k
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. It calculates the maximum number of points that can be achieved given the constraints. Specifically, `n` represents the number of tasks, `k` represents the number of subtasks per task, `M` represents the total available time, and `t` is a list of times required to complete each subtask.

The function iterates through all possible numbers of tasks that can be completed within the given time `M`. For each possible number of tasks completed, it calculates the total time used and the corresponding points. Then, it calculates the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed for the remaining time. This number is constrained by both the remaining time and the remaining tasks.

Finally, the function updates the maximum points achievable by considering the current points plus the subtasks solved. The process continues until all possible scenarios have been evaluated. The function returns the maximum points achieved after evaluating all scenarios.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `M` is zero, no tasks can be completed, so the function should return 0 points.
- If the list `t` is empty, the function should handle this case appropriately, possibly returning 0 points since no subtasks can be completed.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns `max_points`, which is the highest value obtained from the above calculations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code.
