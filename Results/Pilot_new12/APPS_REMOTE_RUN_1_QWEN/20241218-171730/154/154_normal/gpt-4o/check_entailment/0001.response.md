Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the input and initializes variables correctly.
2. **Total Time Calculation**: The total time required to complete one task (`total_time_per_task`) is calculated accurately.
3. **Loop Through Complete Tasks**: The program iterates over the number of complete tasks from 0 to `n` inclusive.
4. **Time and Point Calculation**: For each number of complete tasks, it calculates the time used and the points earned from completing those tasks.
5. **Remaining Time and Subtasks**: It then calculates how many additional subtasks can be completed with the remaining time and adds these to the points.
6. **Max Points Update**: The program keeps track of the maximum points earned across all iterations.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases as described. There is no obvious edge case or potential scenario where the program would fail to meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
