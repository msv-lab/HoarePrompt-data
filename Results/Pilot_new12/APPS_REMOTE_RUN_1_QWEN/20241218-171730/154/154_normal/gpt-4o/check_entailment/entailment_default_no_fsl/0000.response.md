Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case when `M` is zero. According to the problem description, if `M` is zero, no tasks can be completed, and thus, the function should return 0 points. However, the current implementation of the function does not account for this scenario. Additionally, the code assumes that the input list `t` is non-empty, but it does not explicitly handle the case when `t` is an empty list, although this is covered by the problem constraints.

To fix these issues, the code should include checks for these cases:

1. Check if `M` is zero and return 0 points if true.
2. Check if the list `t` is empty and handle this case appropriately, possibly returning 0 points.

Here is a revised version of the function with these checks included:

```python
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    if M == 0:
        return 0
    
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    
    if len(t) == 0:
        return 0
    
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points
```

With these changes, the function will handle the edge cases correctly and ensure that the program meets the problem description for every potential case.
