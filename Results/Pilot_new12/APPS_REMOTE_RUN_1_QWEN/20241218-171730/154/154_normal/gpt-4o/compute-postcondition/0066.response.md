The code subtracts `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from `remaining_time`. Given that `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, the new value of `remaining_time` will be the original `remaining_time` minus this product.

Let's denote the initial values as follows:
- `remaining_time = r`
- `subtask_time = s`
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task = m`

From the initial state:
- `t` must have at least one element
- `remaining_time (r) >= subtask_time (s)`
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time = m`

After executing the code:
- `remaining_time = r - m * s`

Since `subtasks_solved` was incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task` in the previous step, its new value is simply the increment value `m`.

So, the updated states are:
- `remaining_time` is now `r - m * s`
- `subtasks_solved` is `m`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` must have at least one element; `remaining_time` is `r - m * s`; `subtasks_solved` is `m`**
