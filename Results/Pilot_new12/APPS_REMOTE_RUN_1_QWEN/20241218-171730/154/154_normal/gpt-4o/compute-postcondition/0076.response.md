The code `remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` subtracts `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from `remaining_time`. 

- Initially, `remaining_time` is defined as `r - m * s - ((r - m * s) // subtask_time) * subtask_time`.
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is defined as `remaining_time // subtask_time`.

After executing the line of code, `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`.

Let's express `max_subtasks_for_this_task` in terms of the initial `remaining_time`:

- `max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time`.

Therefore, the new value of `remaining_time` will be:

- `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`.

This simplifies to:

- `remaining_time - remaining_time = 0`.

So, the updated values are:
- `remaining_time` is now `0`.
- `subtasks_solved` remains unchanged because the code only affects `remaining_time` and does not modify `subtasks_solved`.
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` also remains unchanged as the code does not alter its value.

Output State: **`t` must have at least two elements, `remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is `m + (r - m * s) // subtask_time + (remaining_time // subtask_time)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`**
