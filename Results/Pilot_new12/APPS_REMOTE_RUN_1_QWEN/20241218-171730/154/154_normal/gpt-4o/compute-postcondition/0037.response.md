Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `complete_tasks` is an integer such that \(1 \leq complete_tasks \leq n\), `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `total_time_per_task` remains as per its initial condition, the current value of `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is now `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, the current value of `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `num_processed` remains as per its initial condition, and `t` must contain at least one element, and the remaining time (`remaining_time`) is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.**
