Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `complete_tasks`, `max_points`, `total_time_per_task`, `time_used`, `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed`, and `t` are integers within their specified ranges. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is reduced by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***

Explanation:
- The precondition sets the initial state of all relevant variables.
- The if part states that if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is updated by subtracting `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`.
- The else part does nothing, meaning that if the condition in the if statement is false, the variables remain unchanged.
- Combining these two scenarios, we get the overall postcondition where the `remaining_time` is adjusted only if the if condition is met.
