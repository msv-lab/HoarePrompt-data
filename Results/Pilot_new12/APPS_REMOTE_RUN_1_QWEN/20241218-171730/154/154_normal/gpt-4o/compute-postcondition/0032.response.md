Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\); `complete_tasks` is an integer such that \(1 \leq complete_tasks \leq n\); `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of `initial_subtasks_solved` and \((n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k\); `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`; `total_time_per_task` remains as per its initial condition; `time_used` is updated to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`; `points`, `remaining_time`, `num_processed` remain as per their initial conditions; if `time_used > M`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
