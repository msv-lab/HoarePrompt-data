According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop can execute if `t` contains at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have at least one element, `remaining_time` is `r - m * s`, and `subtasks_solved` is `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still contain at least one element. Since we are entering a new iteration, we assume that `t` still has at least one element (because if it didn't, the loop would have terminated).

The other variables (`remaining_time` and `subtasks_solved`) remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

State: **`t` must have at least one element, `remaining_time` is `r - m * s`, `subtasks_solved` is `m`**
