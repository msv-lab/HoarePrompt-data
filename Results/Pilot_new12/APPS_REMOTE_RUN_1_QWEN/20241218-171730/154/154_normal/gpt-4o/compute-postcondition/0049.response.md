`subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `complete_tasks` is an integer, `max_points` is an integer, `total_time_per_task` is an integer, `time_used` is an integer, `points` is an integer, `remaining_time` is an integer, `num_processed` is an integer, `t` is a list of integers, `subtask_time` is the next integer in the list `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `complete_tasks` is an integer, `max_points` is an integer, `total_time_per_task` is an integer, `time_used` is an integer, `points` is an integer, `remaining_time` is an integer, `num_processed` is an integer, `t` is a list of integers, `subtask_time` is the next integer in the list `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`**.
