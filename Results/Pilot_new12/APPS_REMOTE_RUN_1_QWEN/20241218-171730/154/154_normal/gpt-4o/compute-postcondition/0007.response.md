The code `points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)` assigns the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)` to the variable `points`. However, the variable `complete_tasks` is not defined in the given initial state or within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the exact value of `points` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `complete_tasks`.

Given the information, the only change is the assignment to `points`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is an integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k integers where each t_j is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `max_points` is 0, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`**.
