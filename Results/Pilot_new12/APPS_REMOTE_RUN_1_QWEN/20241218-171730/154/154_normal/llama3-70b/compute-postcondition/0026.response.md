The code snippet updates `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `M` is greater than or equal to 1
- `dp[1][j]` is updated to `max(dp[1][j], dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1)` if `dp[0][j - t[0]] >= dp[1][j]` and `j >= t[0]` where `j` is `j_end + 1`

After executing the line `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`, the value of `dp[1][j]` (which was updated in the previous step) is set to the value of `dp[1][j - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `i` is 1
- `M` is greater than or equal to 1
- `dp[1][j]` is now `dp[1][j - 1]`

Output State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][j]` is `dp[1][j - 1]`**
