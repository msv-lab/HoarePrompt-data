Postcondition: ***`dp[i][j + 1]` is equal to `dp[i][j]` if `j` is less than `t[i - 1]`; if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j + 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j + 1 - t[i - 1]] + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.***
