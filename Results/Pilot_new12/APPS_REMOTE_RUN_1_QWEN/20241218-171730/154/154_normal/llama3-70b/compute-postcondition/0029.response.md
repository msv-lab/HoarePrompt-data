According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 1 to `M + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `i` is 1
- `M` is greater than or equal to 1
- `dp[1][j]` is equal to `max(dp[1][j - 1], 1)` regardless of the condition `j >= t[i - 1]`

To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration, we need to consider the range of the loop and the current values of the variables.

1. The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = M + 1`.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the highest value it reached.

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

Given that `M` is at least 1, the next possible value for `j` (after the last iteration) would be 2 if the last `j` was 1. If the last `j` was higher, the next value would be incremented accordingly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` remains 1 (unchanged)
- `M` remains greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged)
- `dp[1][j]` needs to be set to `max(dp[1][j - 1], 1)` for the new value of `j` (which is `j + 1`).

Assuming the last `j` was 1, the next value for `j` is 2. Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `M` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][2]` is equal to `max(dp[1][1], 1)`**
