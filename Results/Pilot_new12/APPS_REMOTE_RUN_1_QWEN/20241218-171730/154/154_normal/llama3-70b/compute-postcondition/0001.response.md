The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the values of `n`, `k`, and `M` will be replaced by the values read from the input, and a new variable `t` will be created holding the list of these integers.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n`, `k`, and `M` are integers assigned the values read from the input.
- 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, and 0 ≤ `M` ≤ 2·10^9.

After the code executes, `n`, `k`, and `M` will be replaced by their respective input values, and `t` will be a list containing these values.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `M` are the integers read from the input, and `t` is a list `[n, k, M]`**.
