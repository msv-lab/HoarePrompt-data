The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `M`, which are integers. Additionally, the function takes a list `t` as a parameter, where `t` is a list of `k` integers and each integer in `t` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for 1 ≤ j ≤ k.

Case_1: If any of the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, and 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9 do not hold, the function returns an error message indicating that the input values are out of the specified range.
Case_2: If all the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, and 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9 are satisfied, the function returns some unspecified value based on the list `t`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, `M`, and a list `t`, and return either an error message if the input values are out of range or some value based on the list `t` if all conditions are met.
