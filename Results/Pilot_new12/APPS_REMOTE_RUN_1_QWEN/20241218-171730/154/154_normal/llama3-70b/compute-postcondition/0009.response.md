Postcondition: ***`t` is `[n, k, M]`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where each element is 0 except `dp[1][j]` which is 1 for `j >= t[0]`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 2]` (which is `t[0]`), then the postcondition remains as described in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if the condition is not met.***
