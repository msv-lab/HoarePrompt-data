The code assigns the value of `dp[i][j-1]` to `dp[i][j]`. Since `i` is 1, the specific value of `dp[1][j]` becomes `dp[1][j-1]`. The condition that `M` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `M` must be greater than or equal to 1; `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[1][j-1]`.**
