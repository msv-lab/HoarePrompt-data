Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit \(M\). The DP table `dp` is constructed such that `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed using the first `i` subtasks with `j` minutes available. The program then sums up the points from the DP table and adds the extra point for completing tasks, which aligns with the problem statement.

The annotated version confirms that the program iterates through all valid combinations of `i` and `j` to build the DP table, ensuring that all possible scenarios are considered. The final computation correctly accounts for both the points earned by solving subtasks and the additional points for completing tasks.

Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained, as the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem.
