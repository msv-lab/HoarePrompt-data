Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version confirms that the `func_1` function only sums the contributions of '1's in the string, ignoring the positions of the '0's, which are crucial for a correct comparison. The function does not implement the full sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i \cdot q^{n-i}\), but rather a simplified version that only considers '1's. This leads to incorrect comparisons, as demonstrated by the examples provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment remains correct.
