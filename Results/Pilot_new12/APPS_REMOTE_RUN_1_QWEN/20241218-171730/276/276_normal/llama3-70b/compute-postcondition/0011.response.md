Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, which represents a number in the golden system. It calculates the decimal representation of this golden system number by iterating over each digit in `s` in reverse order, multiplying each digit by \( q^i \) where \( q \) is the golden ratio \(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\) and \( i \) is the index starting from 0. After executing the loop, the function returns the calculated decimal value. This process covers all possible inputs, including edge cases such as a single-digit string, and correctly computes the decimal equivalent without any missing functionality.**
