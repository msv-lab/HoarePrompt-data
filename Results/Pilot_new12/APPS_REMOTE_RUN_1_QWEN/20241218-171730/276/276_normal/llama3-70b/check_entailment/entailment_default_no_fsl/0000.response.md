Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly converts a number represented in the golden system to its decimal equivalent by iterating over each digit in reverse order and applying the formula \(\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}\), where \(q\) is the golden ratio \(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\). The main part of the program compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the appropriate comparison symbol ("<", ">", or "=").

Since the output hints confirm that the function `func_1` handles all cases, including edge cases like single-digit strings, and the program logic is sound, there are no identified issues that would cause the program to fail for any valid input according to the problem description.
