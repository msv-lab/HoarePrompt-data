You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
    return min_segments_needed


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia needs to draw with a ruler does not match the requirements of the problem.

Let's analyze the problem:

- To draw \(n\) squares, each square requires 4 segments.
- When drawing the second square, it can share 2 segments with the first square, thus requiring only 2 additional segments.
- Similarly, the third square can share 2 more segments with the previous squares, and so on.

The correct approach to solving this problem is to realize that the first square always requires 4 segments, and each subsequent square only adds 2 more segments because it can reuse 2 segments from the previous squares.

The formula to calculate the minimum number of segments required should be:
\[ \text{min\_segments\_needed} = 4 + 2 \times (n - 1) \]

However, the provided code uses a different approach involving a nested loop and calculating \(a\) and \(b\). This approach does not correctly capture the essence of minimizing the number of segments needed.

For example, let's consider the input \(n = 2\):
- According to the problem description, the minimum number of segments needed is 3.
- However, the provided code calculates \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2\), leading to \(2 \times (1 + 2) = 6\), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

n = int(input().strip())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    min_segments_needed = float('inf')
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `min_segments_needed` is the minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\) where \(a\) is an integer in the range \([1, \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor]\) and \(b = \left\lceil \frac{n}{a} \right\rceil\); `a` is the last value of `a` within the range \([1, \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor]\) that produced the minimum `segments_needed`; `b` is the corresponding value of \(\left\lceil \frac{n + a - 1}{a} \right\rceil\); `segments_needed` is the final minimum value of \(2 + 2a + 2b\).
    return min_segments_needed
    #`The program returns min_segments_needed which is the minimum value of 2 + 2a + 2b where a is an integer in the range [1, floor(sqrt(n))], and b is the ceiling of n divided by a; and a and b correspond to the values that produce this minimum`


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
