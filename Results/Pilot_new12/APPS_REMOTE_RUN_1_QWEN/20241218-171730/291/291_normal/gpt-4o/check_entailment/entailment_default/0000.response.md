Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` aims to minimize the number of segments that Sofia needs to draw with a ruler to draw \(n\) squares. However, the formula used in the function, \(2 + 2a + 2b\), does not accurately reflect the minimum number of segments needed.

To draw \(n\) squares, the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler (without a guide) is actually \(2n\). This is because each square requires 2 segments to be drawn initially, and subsequent squares can use the previously drawn segments as guides.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the provided code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates \(2 + 2a + 2b\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are derived from \(n\). This formula does not correctly represent the minimum number of segments needed to draw \(n\) squares.

2. **Example Verification**:
   - For \(n = 1\), the correct answer should be 2 (since drawing 1 square requires 2 initial segments).
   - For \(n = 2\), the correct answer should be 3 (since drawing 2 squares requires 3 initial segments).
   - For \(n = 4\), the correct answer should be 4 (since drawing 4 squares requires 4 initial segments).

However, the provided function does not yield these results. Instead, it computes a value based on a different formula, which is not consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
