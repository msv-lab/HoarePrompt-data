You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implementing the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, respectively. However, these functions are not used to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. The key insight is that the LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized when \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) share the maximum common factor possible, which is essentially finding the difference between \( a \) and \( b \).

Here's a correct approach:

1. Calculate the difference between \( a \) and \( b \).
2. If \( a \leq b \), then the optimal \( k \) is 0 because \( \text{LCM}(a, b) \) will be smaller than \( \text{LCM}(a+1, b+1) \).
3. If \( a > b \), then the optimal \( k \) is \( a - b \) because \( \text{LCM}(a+(a-b), b+(a-b)) = \text{LCM}(2a-b, a) \) which is smaller than \( \text{LCM}(a+1+(a-b), b+1+(a-b)) \).

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def find_smallest_k(a, b):
    if a <= b:
        return 0
    else:
        return a - b

a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(find_smallest_k(a, b))
```

This program correctly finds the smallest \( k \) such that the least common multiple of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where both are within the range 1 to \(10^9\). It computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After the computation, the function returns the GCD as the new value of `a` and 0 as the new value of `b`. 

This process handles the following scenarios:
- If either `a` or `b` is zero initially, the function correctly computes the GCD based on the non-zero value.
- If `a` and `b` are equal, the function correctly returns `a` (or `b`) as the GCD.
- The function correctly handles the case where one of the inputs is a multiple of the other.
- The function iteratively reduces the problem size until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original inputs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer division of the product of a and b by the result of func_1(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\)) and returns the integer division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. This means the function computes `(a * b) // func_1(a, b)` and ensures that the result is an integer. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself that need to be handled separately, but the function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` will always return a non-negative value. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a negative value, the behavior of the integer division operation is defined by Python, which will treat the negative value as a non-zero divisor.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
