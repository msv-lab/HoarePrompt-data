Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not correctly find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of \( k \)**:
   - The program calculates \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \).
   - It then iterates over possible values of \( k \) up to \( \sqrt{\text{diff}} \).
   - For each \( k \), it computes new values \( \text{new\_a} \) and \( \text{new\_b} \) as multiples of \( k \) that are greater than or equal to \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) respectively.
   - However, the program does not ensure that these new values are exactly \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). Instead, it rounds them up to the nearest multiple of \( k \).

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \):
     - The program calculates \( \text{diff} = 4 \).
     - It then checks \( k = 1 \) to \( k = 2 \) (since \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \)).
     - For \( k = 1 \):
       - \( \text{new\_a} = (6 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 6 \)
       - \( \text{new\_b} = (10 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 10 \)
       - LCM(6, 10) = 30
     - For \( k = 2 \):
       - \( \text{new\_a} = (6 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 8 \)
       - \( \text{new\_b} = (10 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 12 \)
       - LCM(8, 12) = 24
     - The program returns \( k = 2 \) because LCM(8, 12) = 24 is smaller than LCM(6, 10) = 30.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The expected behavior is to find the smallest \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.
   - For \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \), the correct \( k \) should be 2, as LCM(8, 12) = 24 is indeed smaller than LCM(6, 10) = 30.
   - However, the program incorrectly computes \( \text{new\_a} \) and \( \text{new\_b} \) as multiples of \( k \), which can lead to larger LCM values.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would be to directly compute \( k \) such that \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) are as close as possible to being co-prime or having a small GCD.
   - A more efficient and correct way would be to find the smallest \( k \) such that \( (a + k) \) and \( (b + k) \) have the smallest possible LCM, which can be done by finding the smallest \( k \) such that the GCD of \( (a + k) \) and \( (b + k) \) is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
