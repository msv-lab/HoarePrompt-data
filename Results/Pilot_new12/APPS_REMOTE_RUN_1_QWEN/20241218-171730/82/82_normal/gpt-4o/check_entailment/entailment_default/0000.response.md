Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This ensures that the subsequent LCM calculation is accurate.

2. **LCM Calculation**: The function `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers by dividing their product by their GCD. This is mathematically sound and correctly implemented.

3. **Main Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_3` first checks if \( a \) and \( b \) are equal. If they are, it returns 0, as no adjustment is needed.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \( k \) up to the square root of the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \). For each \( k \), it calculates the nearest multiples of \( k \) for \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).
   - It computes the LCM for these adjusted values and keeps track of the minimum LCM found along with the corresponding \( k \).

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the code appears to handle all edge cases and potential scenarios correctly. The logic is sound, and the implementation follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
