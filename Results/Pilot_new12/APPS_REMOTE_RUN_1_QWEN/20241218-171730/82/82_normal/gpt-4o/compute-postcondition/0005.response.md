The line `min_k = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `min_k`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, or `min_lcm`. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer and not equal to `a`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, `min_lcm` is infinity, `min_k` is 0**
