`min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

- `new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged.
- `new_b` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`.
- `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`.
- `min_k` is now equal to `candidate`.

Output State: **`new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
