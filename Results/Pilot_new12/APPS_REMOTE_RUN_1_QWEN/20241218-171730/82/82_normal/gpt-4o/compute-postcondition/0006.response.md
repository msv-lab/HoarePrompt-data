Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `k`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`.

2. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted:**
   - For the loop to execute, the range condition must be satisfied, i.e., `1` should be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`.
   - This implies that `math.sqrt(diff)` must be greater than `0`, and therefore, `diff` must be greater than `0`.

3. **Consider the Initial States:**
   - `a` is a positive integer.
   - `b` is a positive integer and not equal to `a`.
   - `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, which means `diff = |a - b|`.
   - Since `a` and `b` are both positive integers and `b` is not equal to `a`, `diff` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

4. **Formulate the Required States:**
   - We already know `a` and `b` are positive integers and `b` is not equal to `a`, so `diff` is a positive integer.
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm `diff` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer and not equal to `a`, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is infinity, `min_k` is 0**
