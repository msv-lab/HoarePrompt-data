Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Control Variables**: The loop control variable here is `candidate`. The loop iterates over the values `[k, diff // k]`.

2. **Determine Initial Values for Loop Variables**:
   - `k` is already given as `k + 1` from the state before the loop.
   - `diff` is also known but we need to ensure it's non-zero because division by zero is undefined.
   - `diff // k` needs to be evaluated, but we don't know the exact value of `k` yet. However, we can infer that `k` should be a positive integer (since `a` and `b` are positive integers and `k` is derived from them).

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, both values in the list `[k, diff // k]` must be valid.
   - Since `k` is `k + 1`, it is assumed to be a positive integer.
   - `diff // k` should be a valid integer, which means `diff` must be non-zero and `k` must be a divisor of `diff`.

Given these points, let's adjust the initial state to ensure the loop can execute:

- `a` and `b` are positive integers where `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` remains the same, ensuring it is non-zero.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` are already defined.
- `k` is `k + 1`, so it is a positive integer.

The state needs to ensure that `diff // k` is a valid integer, meaning `diff` must be divisible by `k`.

**State:**
**`a` and `b` are positive integers where `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a non-zero integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is the last `candidate` used to achieve this minimum `min_lcm`, `k` is `k + 1`, and `diff` must be divisible by `k`**.
