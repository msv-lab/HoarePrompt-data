`current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The values of `new_a`, `new_b`, `a`, `candidate`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` depend on the definitions of these variables before this line of code. Since `new_a` and `new_b` are defined as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, the values of `new_a` and `new_b` do not change, and `current_lcm` is updated based on the function call.

Output State: **`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `current_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated based on the new `candidate` (either `k` or `diff // k`).**
