The code `min_lcm = current_lcm` assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. This means that `min_lcm` now holds the value of `current_lcm`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is now `current_lcm`, `min_k` is now `diff // k`, `candidate` is now `diff // k`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `diff // k` that is greater than or equal to `b + diff // k - 1`, and `current_lcm` is `lcm_value`.**
