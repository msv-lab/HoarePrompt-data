The code sets `min_lcm` to the value of `current_lcm`. This means that `min_lcm` now holds the value of `current_lcm`, which was previously the return value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the same as `current_lcm`, `min_k` is the same, `k` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is `(a + (diff // 2) - 1) // (diff // 2) * (diff // 2)`, `new_b` is `(b + (k - 1) - 1) // (k - 1) * (k - 1)`, `current_lcm` is the return value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
