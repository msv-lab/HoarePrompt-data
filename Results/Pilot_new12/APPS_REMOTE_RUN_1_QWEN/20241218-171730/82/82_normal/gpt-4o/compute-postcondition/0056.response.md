Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` remains the same, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is the corresponding candidate that achieved this minimum LCM, and `k` is incremented. If `diff % k == 0`, then `new_a` is the largest multiple of `min_k` that is less than or equal to `a + min_k - 1`, and `new_b` is the largest multiple of `min_k` that is less than or equal to `b + min_k - 1`. Otherwise, the values of `new_a` and `new_b` remain unchanged.***
