The code initializes the variable `min_lcm` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `diff`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer and not equal to `a`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, `min_lcm` is infinity.**
