The code sets `min_k` to the value of `candidate`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, or `current_lcm`. 

Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is `candidate`, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
