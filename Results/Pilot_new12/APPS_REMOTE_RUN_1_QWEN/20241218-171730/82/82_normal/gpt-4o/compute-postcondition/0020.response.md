The code `min_lcm = current_lcm` updates the value of `min_lcm` to be equal to `current_lcm`. No other variables are affected. 

Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to its original value, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is the minimum value between the previous `min_lcm` and `current_lcm`, `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` when `min_lcm` is achieved, `candidate` is now `k`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b + candidate - 1`, and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
