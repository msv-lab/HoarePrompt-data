The line `min_lcm = current_lcm` assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. The values of `new_a`, `a`, `candidate`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_k`, and `min_lcm` are updated accordingly. 

Given that `new_a` and `new_b` are already defined based on `a`, `candidate`, and `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, these values remain unchanged. The only change is that `min_lcm` now holds the value of `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `min_k` remains unchanged.**
