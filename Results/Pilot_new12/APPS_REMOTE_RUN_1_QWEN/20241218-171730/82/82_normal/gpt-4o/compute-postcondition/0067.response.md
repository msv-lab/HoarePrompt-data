Output State: **`a` is the same, `b` is the same, `diff` is the same, `min_lcm` is the same, `min_k` is the same, `k` is `diff // 2`, `new_a` is `(a + (diff // 2) - 1) // (diff // 2) * (diff // 2)`, `new_b` is recalculated based on `b` and the new `k`, `current_lcm` is recalculated based on `new_a` and `new_b`.**
