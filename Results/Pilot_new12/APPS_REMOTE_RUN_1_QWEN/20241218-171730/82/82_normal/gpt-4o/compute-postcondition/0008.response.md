To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `a` is a positive integer.
   - `b` is a positive integer and not equal to `a`.
   - `diff` is a positive integer.
   - `min_lcm` is infinity.
   - `min_k` is 0.
   - The current value of `k` satisfies `diff % k == 0`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the values `[k, diff // k]`.
   - For the loop to execute, the list `[k, diff // k]` must contain at least one valid value, i.e., a non-negative integer.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - Both `k` and `diff // k` must be defined and non-negative integers.
   - Since `diff % k == 0`, `k` is a divisor of `diff`, ensuring that `diff // k` is an integer.
   - The only condition that might need adjustment is ensuring that `k` is a valid positive integer that divides `diff`.

Given the initial conditions, we already know:
- `k` is a positive integer (since `diff % k == 0`).
- `diff // k` is also an integer because `k` divides `diff`.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed beyond confirming the initial states as they are sufficient for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer and not equal to `a`, `diff` is a positive integer, `min_lcm` is infinity, `min_k` is 0, and the current value of `k` satisfies `diff % k == 0`**
