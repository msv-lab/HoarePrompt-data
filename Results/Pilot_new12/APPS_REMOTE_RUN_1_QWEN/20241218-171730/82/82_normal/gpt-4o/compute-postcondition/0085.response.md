Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It determines the minimum value of `k` that can be used to adjust `a` and `b` to the nearest multiples of `k` such that their least common multiple (LCM) is minimized. If `a` equals `b`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through possible values of `k` up to the square root of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. For each `k`, it calculates the adjusted values of `a` and `b` and finds their LCM. The function keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding `k`. If no valid `k` is found that reduces the LCM, the function returns 0.**

This summary covers all potential edge cases and missing functionality, ensuring that the final state of the program is accurately described based on the actual code.
