Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer and not equal to `a`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found during the loop, `min_k` is the corresponding minimum `k`, `k` is `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, and if the loop did not execute at all, `min_lcm` remains `infinity` and `min_k` remains `0`.**
