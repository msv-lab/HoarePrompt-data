Postcondition: ***`a` is `a`, `b` is `b`, `diff` is `diff`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found so far, `min_k` is the corresponding minimum k, `k` is `k`, `current_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
