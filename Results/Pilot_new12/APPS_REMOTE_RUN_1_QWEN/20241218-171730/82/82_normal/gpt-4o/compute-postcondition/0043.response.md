`new_b` is assigned the value `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The value of `b` is updated according to this formula, but the specific value of `b` is not given. Other variables (`new_a`, `a`, `candidate`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` and `candidate` remain unchanged, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_lcm` remains unchanged, `min_k` remains unchanged.**
