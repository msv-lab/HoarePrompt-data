#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, which is x since y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` is 0. At this point, `x` contains the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. 

This process handles the case where `y` might initially be 0, in which case the function immediately returns `x` without entering the loop. Additionally, the function correctly handles the scenario where both `x` and `y` are positive integers greater than 0, as it repeatedly reduces the problem size until `y` becomes 0. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the integer division of x multiplied by y by the result of the function func_1(x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It first multiplies `x` by `y`, then divides the result by the output of `func_1(x, y)` using integer division. The function returns the final result. Potential edge cases include when `func_1(x, y)` returns 0, which would cause a division by zero error. However, no handling for this specific case is present in the given code, so it is up to the caller to ensure `func_1(x, y)` does not return 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    if (a == b) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and a is not equal to b
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if (current_lcm < min_lcm or current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate <
                    min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer and not equal to `a`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found during the loop, `min_k` is the corresponding minimum `k`, `k` is `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, and if the loop did not execute at all, `min_lcm` remains `infinity` and `min_k` remains `0`.
    return min_k
    #`The program returns min_k which is the corresponding minimum k when the loop did not execute at all, and thus remains 0`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It determines the minimum value of `k` that can be used to adjust `a` and `b` to the nearest multiples of `k` such that their least common multiple (LCM) is minimized. If `a` equals `b`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through possible values of `k` up to the square root of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. For each `k`, it calculates the adjusted values of `a` and `b` and finds their LCM. The function keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding `k`. If no valid `k` is found that reduces the LCM, the function returns 0.
