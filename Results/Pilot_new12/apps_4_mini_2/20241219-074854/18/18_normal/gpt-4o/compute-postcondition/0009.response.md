Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the printed value is equal to `t`. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the printed value is `k`. Otherwise, since `t` is greater than `n`, the printed value is `n + k - t.***
