The code executes a `print` statement which outputs the value of `k`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the existing precondition information along with the printed value of `k`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. The value of `t` is greater than `k`, and the current value of `t` is less than or equal to `n`. The value printed is `k`.**
