The code `print(t)` outputs the current value of `t`. Since the precondition states that `t` is an integer and the current value of `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the value printed will be the same as the value assigned to `t`.

After this line is executed, the value of `t` remains unchanged, so all other variables remain as they were, and the output is simply a representation of `t` being printed.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k; the printed value is equal to `t`.**
