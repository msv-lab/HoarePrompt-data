Functionality: **The function reads three integers: `n`, `k`, and `t` from input, constrained by `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`. It then evaluates the value of `t` to determine what to print: if `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`; if `t` is between `k` and `n`, it prints `k`; and if `t` exceeds `n`, it calculates and prints `n + k - t`. Thus, the function outputs a value based on these comparisons and conditions, which could represent some processed result related to `t` in the context defined by `n` and `k`. Note that the function only prints the result and does not return any values.**
