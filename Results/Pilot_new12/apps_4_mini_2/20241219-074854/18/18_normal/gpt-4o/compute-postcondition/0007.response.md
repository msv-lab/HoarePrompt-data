The code snippet `print(n + k - t)` computes the value of `n + k - t` and outputs it, but does not change any variables. Given the initial conditions where `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers defined as such:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ k ≤ n
1 ≤ t < n + k
t > k
t > n

The expression `n + k - t` will yield a specific integer result, which we denote as `result`.

Since the variable values are not specified, the general output state will describe the computation without changing any values.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, with t > k, t > n; the result of the expression is `n + k - t`.**
