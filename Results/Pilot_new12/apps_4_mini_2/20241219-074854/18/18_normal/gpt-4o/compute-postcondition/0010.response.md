The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `t`. All three parameters are integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. After executing the function body, it evaluates the parameters and returns a result based on certain conditions. However, since the specific output conditions were not provided in the prompt, I am unable to describe them in detail.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integer parameters `n`, `k`, and `t`, with specified constraints, and return a result based on the evaluation of these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and t which are integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k, and returns a result based on these parameters.**
