The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned new integer values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of these variables will depend on user input but will remain within their stipulated bounds: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. Therefore, while we don't know the specific values they will take, we know that they will be integers that respect these constraints.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k** (the specific values will depend on user input).
