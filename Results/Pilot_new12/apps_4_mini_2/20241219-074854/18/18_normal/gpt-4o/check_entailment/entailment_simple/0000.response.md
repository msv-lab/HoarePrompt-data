To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the program and check it against the required behavior described in the problem.

### Problem Review:
The problem requires us to determine how many spectators are standing at time `t` in a sequence of events. The following points summarize how the spectators behave:
1. From time 1 to `k`, the first `k` spectators stand up, resulting in exactly `t` spectators standing at time `t` for `1 ≤ t ≤ k`.
2. From time `k + 1` to `n`, all `k` spectators remain standing as each new spectator stands up, and one from the front sits down.
3. After time `n`, as time increases beyond `n`, for each unit of time, one spectator from the standing group (the earliest) sits down, resulting in `n + k - t` spectators standing at times where `n < t < n + k`.

### Code Analysis:
The implementation of the program is as follows:
```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    if (t <= k):
        print(t)
    else:
        if (t <= n):
            print(k)
        else:
            print(n + k - t)
```
- For the case `t <= k`, it correctly returns `t` because that matches the specification of how many spectators are standing at that time.
- When `t` is between `k + 1` and `n`, it prints `k`, which is correct as well since all `k` spectators are still standing.
- For `t > n`, the term `n + k - t` accurately reflects the number of standing spectators since this accounts for each spectator sitting as time progresses beyond `n`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all specified cases from the problem description by accurately counting the number of standing spectators at any given time `t`. Thus, it adheres fully to the requirements and produces correct output for all valid input ranges defined in the problem description.

Therefore, we conclude that the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
