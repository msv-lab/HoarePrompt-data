You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 5 3

Output
3

Input
10 5 7

Output
5

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    elif t <= n:
        print(k)
    else:
        print(n + k - t)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when \( t \) is greater than \( n \) but less than \( n + k \). Specifically, it will output `n + k - t`, which is not the correct number of standing spectators according to the problem description. 

For example, if we take the input \( n = 10, k = 5, t = 11 \):

1. According to the problem, at \( t = 11 \), it should represent the spectators as follows:
   - At \( t = 11 \), the 6th spectator sits down, while the previously standing spectators remain, resulting in 4 standing spectators.
   
2. However, the program outputs `n + k - t = 10 + 5 - 11 = 4` which is correct in this case, but it does not properly ensure the logic correctly applies to every instance. Testing more cases can show that inconsistencies arise.

Consider the input: \( n = 10, k = 5, t = 12 \):
- At \( t = 12 \), the 7th spectator sits down, while we still have 3 spectators standing.
- According to the program, it would output `n + k - t = 10 + 5 - 12 = 3`, which is again correct. However, this doesn't establish the program's reliability due to complexity.

The algorithm effectively tracks the maximum standing spectators accurately (either when spectators are standing or sitting) in certain segments but neglects to properly account for the transition section in a comprehensive way across different spectating dynamics beyond those direct test scenarios, where these transitions might yield other outputs due to potential indexing or integer arithmetic mishaps.

Thus, the program isn't fully reliable as per the provided specification and has technical discrepancies in certain edge cases. Therefore, the output is marked as false accordingly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    if (t <= k) :
        print(t)
    else :
        if (t <= n) :
            print(k)
        else :
            print(n + k - t)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the value printed is `k`. Otherwise, since `t` is greater than `n`, the result is `n + k - t`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the printed value is equal to `t`. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the printed value is `k`. Otherwise, since `t` is greater than `n`, the printed value is `n + k - t.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers: `n`, `k`, and `t` from input, constrained by `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`. It then evaluates the value of `t` to determine what to print: if `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`; if `t` is between `k` and `n`, it prints `k`; and if `t` exceeds `n`, it calculates and prints `n + k - t`. Thus, the function outputs a value based on these comparisons and conditions, which could represent some processed result related to `t` in the context defined by `n` and `k`. Note that the function only prints the result and does not return any values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
