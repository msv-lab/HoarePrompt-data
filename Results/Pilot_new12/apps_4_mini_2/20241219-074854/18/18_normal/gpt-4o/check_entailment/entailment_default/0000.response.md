The program takes three integers `n`, `k`, and `t`, and correctly handles the logic for the Mexican wave as per the description provided. The logic is as follows:

- If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, this corresponds to the phase where the first `t` spectators are standing. Thus, the output is simply `t`.
- If `t` is between `k` and `n`, it means that all `k` spectators are standing since `k` spectators can stand at most at time `t`, and the output is `k`.
- If `t` is greater than `n`, it means that spectators are starting to sit down. The number of spectators standing is calculated by `n + k - t`. This corresponds to deducting the amount of spectators that have sat down from the `k` already standing.

The program follows the logic in the problem description for all possible values of `t` since:
- It accurately counts the standing spectators for all cases defined in the time range provided.
- The conditions for each case are clearly defined and covered with respective outputs based on the input constraints.

The output hints match the logic of the program, confirming that it returns the correct number of standing spectators for each potential case.

Example checks from the problem description have also shown that the function outputs the correct result for each provided input:

- Input: `(10, 5, 3)` outputs `3`, which is correct.
- Input: `(10, 5, 7)` outputs `5`, which is correct.
- Input: `(10, 5, 12)` outputs `3`, which is correct.

Since the program satisfies the requirements for every potential case specified in the problem description and the outputs align correctly, the assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
