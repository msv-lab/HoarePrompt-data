The line of code `n, k, t = map(int, input().split())` will assign values to `n`, `k`, and `t` based on user input, converting the input from strings to integers. The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are positive integers with the conditions provided. Since the initial conditions state that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`, after execution, the state of these variables will reflect the new integers inputted by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `t` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` < `n + k`.**
