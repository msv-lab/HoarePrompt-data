The provided code contains a conditional expression that checks the value of `t` relative to `n`. Depending on the outcome of the condition, it either returns `min(t, k)` if `t` is less than or equal to `n`, or calculates `k - (t - n) % k` if `t` is greater than `n`. 

Given the constraints (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, 1 ≤ `t` < `n + k`), we know that:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer that does not exceed `n`
- `t` is a positive integer that is strictly less than `n + k`.

Thus, the evaluation of the output will depend on the relationship of `t` to `n`:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the output is `min(t, k)`.
2. If `t` is greater than `n`, the output is `k - (t - n) % k`.

Since both scenarios are covered in the print statement but only one value will be printed at runtime depending on the input values, we need to keep the possible values in mind:

- If `t` ≤ `n`, then the output will be `min(t, k)`. 
- If `t` > `n`, then the output will depend on the specific values of `t`, `n`, and `k`, leading to the result of `k - (t - n) % k`.

Therefore, after evaluating the conditional expression and determining the correct branch to take, the Output State will still contain the original values of `n`, `k`, and `t`, but with an additional specification of the output result based on those variables' relationships. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `t` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` < `n + k`; output is either `min(t, k)` if `t <= n` or `k - (t - n) % k` if `t > n`.**
