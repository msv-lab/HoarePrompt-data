To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the functionality and behavior of the program step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We have `n` spectators labeled from 1 to `n`.
2. At time `1` to `k`, the first `k` spectators start standing.
3. From time `k + 1` onwards, spectators will sit and new ones will stand until all spectators have either stood or sat down.
4. We need to determine how many spectators are standing at a given time `t`.

### Observations:
- For times `t` ranging from `1` to `k`:
  - The count of standing spectators should be equal to `t` since each successive second a new spectator stands up.
  
- For times `t` from `k + 1` to `n`:
  - The count of standing spectators should stabilize at `k` because while one new spectator stands, the first one that stood will sit down, maintaining exactly `k` spectators standing.

- After time `n`, from `n + 1` to `n + k`:
  - The number of standing spectators should decrease as the last few standing spectators sit down. After time `n`, the number of spectators standing is `k - (t - n)` which correctly accounts for the reduction of spectators standing.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the number of spectators standing at time `t`. Let's analyze its logic:

```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

- The program uses two conditions:
  1. `if t <= n`: 
     - It uses `min(t, k)` to ensure that it returns `t` as long as it does not exceed `k`. This correctly handles times `1` to `k`.

  2. `else`: 
     - It handles times `t` from `n + 1` to `n + k`. The expression `k - (t - n) % k` captures the number of spectators standing by calculating how many have sat back down as time progresses.

### Examples Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 3`, it returns `3` which is correct.
2. For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 7`, it returns `5`, also correct.
3. For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `t = 12`, it returns `3`, which holds true.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic necessary to determine the number of standing spectators at any given time `t` based on the problem description.

Therefore, since the program adheres strictly to the requirements defined in the problem description for all possible input cases:

Correctness: **True**
