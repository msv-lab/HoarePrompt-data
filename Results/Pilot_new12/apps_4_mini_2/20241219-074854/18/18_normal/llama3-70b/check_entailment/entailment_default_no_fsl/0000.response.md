To determine the correctness of the given Python program in accordance with the problem description, we'll analyze the provided code and the specific output hints.

The problem describes how spectators participate in a Mexican wave, involving a pattern of standing and sitting based on time t. Let's break down the code logic against the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers n, k, and t.
   
2. **Logic Flow**:
   - If `t <= n`, the function directly computes `min(t, k)`, which effectively gives the number of spectators standing since up to k spectators can be standing at that moment as they progressively stand from time 1 to time k.
   - If `t > n`, the function computes `k - (t - n) % k`. This part figures out how many spectators are standing after reaching the total number (n) and adjusting for the sitting sequence thereafter.

3. **Expected Outputs**:
   - The sequence of standing confusion at different times leads to an interpretation that needs to conform to the wave behavior described.
   - By analyzing the example outputs provided in the problem statement, we can expect specific outputs for varying t values, in line with standing spectators at different times.

**Testing with Examples**:
- For the example input `10 5 3`: 
  ``` 
  1 stands -> 1
  2 stands -> 2
  3 stands -> 3
  ```
  The output is `3`, which matches. 

- For `10 5 7`: 
  ```
  1 stands
  2 stands
  3 stands
  4 stands
  5 stands
  1 sits (now 5 standing)
  2 sits (still 5)
  3 sits (still 5)
  4 sits (still 5)
  5 sits (now 5 standing)
  ```
  Again, the output is `5`, which matches.

- For `10 5 12`: 
  ```
  ...
  11 sits
  12 sits
  13 stands (this converts immediately to sitting vs standing)
  ```
  The result is `3`, precisely as required.

4. **Identifying Edge Cases**:
   - The program appears to account for when `t` is less than, equal to, or greater than `n`. The modulo operation handles the repetitive nature of the sitting/standing sequence correctly. 
   - The conditions laid appear to be logically sound throughout the range of specified inputs (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).

**Conclusion**: The logic implemented in the program correlates closely with the problem statement and maintains correctness across varying values of `t` as outlined in the examples. Since it processes based on the outlined wave structure effectively, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True**
