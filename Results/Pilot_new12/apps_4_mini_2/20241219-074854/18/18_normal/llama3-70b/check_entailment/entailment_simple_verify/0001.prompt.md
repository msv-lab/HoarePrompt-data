You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 5 3

Output
3

Input
10 5 7

Output
5

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. At time \( t \):
   - From \( t = 1 \) to \( t = k \), the number of standing spectators increases from 1 to \( k \).
   - From \( t = k + 1 \) to \( t = n \), the number of standing spectators stays constant at \( k \).
   - For \( t \) values from \( n + 1 \) to \( n + k \), the number of standing spectators decreases from \( k \) to 0.

### Program Logic:
The program logic consists of the following condition:
- If \( t \) is less than or equal to \( n \):
  - If \( t \) is less than or equal to \( k \), it prints \( t \) (which is correct because that corresponds to the increasing number of spectators).
  - If \( t \) exceeds \( k \) but is less than or equal to \( n \), it prints \( k \) (which is correct because the number of spectators remains at \( k \)).
- If \( t \) is greater than \( n \):
  - It uses the formula \( k - (t - n) \% k \) to calculate the number of spectators who are standing. This attempts to account for the decreasing number of standing spectators.

### Analyzing the Formula \( k - (t - n) \% k \):
This formula intends to represent the decrease in standing spectators starting from \( t = n + 1 \) down to \( t = n + k \). However, handling the modulo operation in this manner could produce incorrect results for certain edge cases.

### Test Cases:
Let's evaluate certain values for \( t \):
- For \( n = 10 \), \( k = 5 \), and \( t = 11 \):
  - Expected: 4 (since \( k \) decreases by one each time after \( t = 10 \))
  - Output: \( k - (11 - 10) \% 5 = 5 - 1 = 4 \) → Correct!
  
- For \( n = 10 \), \( k = 5 \), and \( t = 12 \):
  - Expected: 3
  - Output: \( k - (12 - 10) \% 5 = 5 - 2 = 3 \) → Correct!
  
- For \( n = 10 \), \( k = 5 \), and \( t = 13 \):
  - Expected: 2
  - Output: \( k - (13 - 10) \% 5 = 5 - 3 = 2 \) → Correct!

- For \( n = 10 \), \( k = 5 \), and \( t = 14 \):
  - Expected: 1
  - Output: \( k - (14 - 10) \% 5 = 5 - 4 = 1 \) → Correct!

- For \( n = 10 \), \( k = 5 \), and \( t = 15 \):
  - Expected: 0
  - Output: \( k - (15 - 10) \% 5 = 5 - 0 = 5 \) → Incorrect (it should return 0, since all spectators are seated).

### Conclusion:
The program fails to provide the correct output when \( t = n + k \). Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and t are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
