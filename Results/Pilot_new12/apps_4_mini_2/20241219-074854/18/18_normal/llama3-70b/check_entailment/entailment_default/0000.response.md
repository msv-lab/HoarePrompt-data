The provided program aims to determine how many spectators are standing at a specified time `t` during the Mexican wave. The function reads inputs for the number of spectators `n`, the number `k` of spectators that can be standing at any given time, and the time `t`.

Based on the logic of the provided code:

1. The code checks if `t` is less than or equal to `n`. If this condition is true, it returns the minimum of `t` and `k`, meaning it counts how many spectators are standing as they start standing one by one until `k`. 
   
2. If `t` is greater than `n`, the code calculates the number of standing spectators by determining how many spectators are still standing after the wave has reached its maximum (when all `k` spectators are standing) and how many have begun to sit down. The calculation uses `k - (t - n) % k`.

The program appears to follow the specified logic given in the problem description and handles the edge cases as indicated in the hints. Therefore, it correctly computes the expected standing spectators at any given time `t`.

After checking the provided examples:

- For `(10, 5, 3)`, this returns `3`, which is accurate.
- For `(10, 5, 7)`, this returns `5`, which is also accurate.
- For `(10, 5, 12)`, this returns `3`, which matches the expected output provided in the description.

There doesn't seem to be any discrepancy with the output, and the logic in the code correctly manages all expected cases.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **True**.
