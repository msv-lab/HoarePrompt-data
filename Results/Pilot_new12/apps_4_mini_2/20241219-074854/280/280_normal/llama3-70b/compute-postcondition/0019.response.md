To analyze the impact of the code snippet on the initial state, we need to check how the value of `max_length` is affected by the execution of `max_length += max_speed`.

1. **Initial State Considerations**:
   - `max_length` was previously calculated as `(t + 2) * max_speed`.
   - `max_speed` remains unchanged as it was updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.
   - Other variables like `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `min_length`, `i`, and `min_speed` are not affected by this line of code.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - This line increments `max_length` by the current value of `max_speed`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `max_length` becomes `(t + 2) * max_speed + max_speed`.

3. **Precondition Validation**:
   - The initial constraints on `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `min_length`, `i`, and `min_speed` remain valid after execution.
   - Only `max_length` will have its value changed as a result of executing the code.

Based on this analysis, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`**.
