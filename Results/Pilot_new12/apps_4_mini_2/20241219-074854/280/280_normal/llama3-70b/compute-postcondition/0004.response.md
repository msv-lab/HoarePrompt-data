The variable `max_length` is assigned the value of `max_speed * t`, where `max_speed` is the maximum of the two input integers (`v_1` and `v_2`), and `t` is another input integer. The specific values of `max_speed`, `v_1`, `v_2`, and `t` will contribute to the calculation, but we do not have those exact values in the initial state. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_length` is determined by the product of `max_speed` and `t` while keeping the relationships consistent among the other variables.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`; `min_speed` is equal to `min(v_1, v_2); `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`.**
