To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the initial conditions and the impact of the code.

Initial State:
- `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100
- `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100
- `t` is an input integer
- `d` is an input integer
- `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`

The code snippet:
```
min_speed = min(v_1, v_2)
```

The variable `min_speed` is assigned the value of the minimum between `v_1` and `v_2`. As `v_1` and `v_2` are both integers between 1 and 100, `min_speed` will also be an integer, and its value will be less than or equal to the smaller of the two input integers.

Output State:
- `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100
- `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100
- `t` is an input integer
- `d` is an input integer
- `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`
- `min_speed` is equal to `min(v_1, v_2)`

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`; `min_speed` is equal to `min(v_1, v_2)`**
