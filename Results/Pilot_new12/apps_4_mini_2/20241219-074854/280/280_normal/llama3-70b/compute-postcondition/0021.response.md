Let's determine the output state after all iterations of the loop. The loop iterates from `t - 1` down to 1 (exclusive), meaning it will execute a total of `t - 1` times if `t` is greater than or equal to 2.

During each iteration, `max_speed` decreases by `d` (but cannot go below `min_speed`), and `min_speed` increases by `d` (but cannot exceed `max_speed`). Both `max_length` and `min_length` are updated with their respective speed values.

The loop's dynamics depend on the values of `d`, `max_speed`, and `min_speed`, which themselves depend on the original values of `v_1` and `v_2`.

Since we want to capture the output state after all iterations:

1. If the loop executes `t - 1` times (when `t` is at least 2), we need `max_speed` and `min_speed` to be updated `t - 1` times.
2. After `t - 1` iterations:
   - `max_speed` will equal `max(v_1, v_2) - (t - 1) * d`, but this value cannot be less than `min(v_1, v_2)`.
   - `min_speed` will equal `min(v_1, v_2) + (t - 1) * d`, but this value cannot be greater than `max_speed`.
   - `max_length` will equal the sum of the reduced `max_speed` over `t - 1` iterations plus its initial `max_length`, producing a cumulative effect.
   - Similarly, `min_length` will grow cumulatively based on `min_speed`.

Given these deductions:

If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `t < 2`):
- `max_speed` remains as `max(v_1, v_2)`.
- `min_speed` remains as `min(v_1, v_2)`.
- `max_length` remains as the initial `max_length` (`max_speed * t`).
- `min_length` remains as the initial `min_length` (`min_speed * t`).

So, the final output state after all iterations would be described as:

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(v_1, v_2) - (t - 1) * d`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(v_1, v_2) + (t - 1) * d`, `max_length` is equal to the cumulative sum over `t - 1` iterations, `min_length` is equal to the cumulative sum over `t - 1` iterations.`**
