The values of `v_1` and `v_2` are assigned new values obtained from user input, where the input consists of two integers split by space and converted to integers. The initial conditions state that `v_1` and `v_2` are integers in the range of 1 to 100. After the assignment, the value of `v_1` and `v_2` will now be determined by the user input, but the precise values of `v_1` and `v_2` remain unknown and will depend on user input at runtime. The initial conditions for `t` and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer in the range 2 to 100; `d` is an integer in the range 0 to 10.**
