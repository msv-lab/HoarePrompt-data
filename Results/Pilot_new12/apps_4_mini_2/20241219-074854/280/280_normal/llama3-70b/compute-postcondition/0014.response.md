The variable `max_length` is updated by adding `max_speed` to its current value. The previous state indicates that `max_length` is equal to `(t + 1) * max_speed`, which means that after the operation, `max_length` will be `(t + 1) * max_speed + max_speed`. This simplifies to `(t + 2) * max_speed`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `(t + 2) * max_speed`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is t - 2.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `(t + 2) * max_speed`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is t - 2.**
