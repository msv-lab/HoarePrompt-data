The variable `min_length` is assigned the value of `min_speed * t`. The variable `min_speed` is equal to `min(v_1, v_2)`, and `t` is an input integer. Therefore, `min_length` becomes `min(v_1, v_2) * t`. The values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, and `max_length` remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`; `min_speed` is equal to `min(v_1, v_2); `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`; `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`.**
