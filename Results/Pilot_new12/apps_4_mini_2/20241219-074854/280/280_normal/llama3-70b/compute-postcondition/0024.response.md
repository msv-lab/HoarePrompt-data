Functionality: **The function reads two integers (v1 and v2) representing speeds and two integers (t and d) representing time and speed change, respectively. It computes the maximum and minimum cumulative distances covered over a given time `t`, while adjusting the speeds based on the value of `d`. The function iterates from `t-1` down to 1, updating the maximum speed by decreasing it by `d` and the minimum speed by increasing it by `d`, ensuring that the maximum does not go below the minimum speed. After executing the loop, it prints the final computed maximum distance.**

**Important notes include:**
- The function does not explicitly return any value; it only prints the maximum distance.
- Edge cases such as ensuring that `d` does not cause the maximum speed to drop below the minimum speed are handled by the `max` and `min` functions.
- The code does not check for invalid input scenarios or perform any error handling, assuming that inputs will always stay within their defined ranges.
- The final state of the program is characterized by the printed maximum cumulative distance, which is derived from the inputs and the loop calculations, while the minimum distance is not outputted or utilized further.
