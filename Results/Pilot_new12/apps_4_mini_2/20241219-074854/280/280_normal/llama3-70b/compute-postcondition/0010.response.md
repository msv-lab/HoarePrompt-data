The variable `min_length` is updated by adding `min_speed` to its current value. The other variables retain their previous values. Hence the output reflects the updated value of `min_length` while including the conditions for all other variables.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to max(max_speed - d, min_speed), `min_speed` is updated to min(min_speed + d, max_speed), `max_length` is equal to (t + 1) * `max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is t - 1.**
