Initial State: `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to max(max_speed - d, min_speed), `min_speed` is updated to min(min_speed + d, max_speed), `max_length` is equal to max_speed * t, `min_length` is equal to min_speed * t, `i` is t - 1.

```
max_length += max_speed
```
Now, `max_length` increases by the current value of `max_speed`. The previous value of `max_length` was `max_speed * t`, so the updated value of `max_length` after the addition will be `max_speed * t + max_speed`, which can be factored out to `(t + 1) * max_speed`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to max(max_speed - d, min_speed), `min_speed` is updated to min(min_speed + d, max_speed), `max_length` is equal to (t + 1) * `max_speed`, `min_length` is equal to min_speed * t, `i` is t - 1.**
