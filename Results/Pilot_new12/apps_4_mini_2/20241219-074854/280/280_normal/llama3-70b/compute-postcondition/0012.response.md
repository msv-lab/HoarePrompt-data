Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` must be greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` remains unchanged, `max_length` is equal to `(t + 1) * max_speed`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is t - 2.**
