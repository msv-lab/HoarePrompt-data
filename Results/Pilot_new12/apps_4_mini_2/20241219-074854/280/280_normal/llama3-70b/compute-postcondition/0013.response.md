To analyze the code in the initial state and determine the output state, we start by identifying the variables and their constraints:

1. `v_1` and `v_2` are input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
2. `t` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3.
3. `d` is an input integer.
4. `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, which defines an upper limit based on the reduction by `d`, but not below `min_speed`.
5. `min_speed` remains unchanged after the first update.
6. `max_length` is calculated as `(t + 1) * max_speed`.
7. `min_length` remains unchanged.
8. `i` is assigned the value of `t - 2`.

Now, the new code we need to execute is:
```
min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
```

### Effects of the Code Execution
- The variable `min_speed` is updated. The new value of `min_speed` is the result of `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, meaning `min_speed` will either increase by `d` or be capped at `max_speed`, whichever is lesser.
- The values of `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` remain unchanged in state but are included in the output for clarity.

### Output State
Given these observations, the updated output after executing this line of code would record the new value for `min_speed` while retaining the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `(t + 1) * max_speed`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is t - 2.**
