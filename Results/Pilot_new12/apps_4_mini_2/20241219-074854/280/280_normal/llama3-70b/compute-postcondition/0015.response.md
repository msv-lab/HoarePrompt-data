The variable `min_length` is updated by adding `min_speed` to its previous value. The initial state indicates that `min_length` remains unchanged before this operation, and `min_speed` is the result of the previous calculations depending on the inputs. Therefore, `min_length` will increase by the value of `min_speed`, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `(t + 2) * max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is t - 2.**
