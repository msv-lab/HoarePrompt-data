The code executes a `print` statement for `max_length`. The statement does not alter any variables or calculations; it merely displays the value of `max_length`. The `max_length` variable remains as the cumulative sum over `t - 1` iterations, and there's no change to any other variables mentioned.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(v_1, v_2) - (t - 1) * d`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(v_1, v_2) + (t - 1) * d`, `max_length` is equal to the cumulative sum over `t - 1` iterations, `min_length` is equal to the cumulative sum over `t - 1` iterations, and the value of `max_length` is printed.**
