Let's analyze the impact of the code on the program step by step.

1. The variable `max_speed` is recalculated. The expression `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` takes the current value of `max_speed`, subtracts `d` from it, and compares this result with `min_speed`. The new value of `max_speed` will be the greater of these two values.

2. The other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i`) remain unchanged after this code execution.

Given the above analysis, the output state can be expressed as:
- `max_speed` can be updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.
- The values of `v_1`, `v_2` are still input integers between 1 and 100.
- `t` still must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `d` remains an input integer.
- `min_speed` continues to be equal to `min(v_1, v_2)`.
- `max_length` retains its value of `max_speed * t`.
- `min_length` continues to be `min_speed * t`.
- `i` remains `t - 1`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to max(max_speed - d, min_speed), `min_speed` is equal to min(v_1, v_2), `max_length` is equal to max_speed * t, `min_length` is equal to min_speed * t, `i` is t - 1.**
