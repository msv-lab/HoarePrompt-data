The values of `t` and `d` are assigned based on the input provided by `input().split()`, which gets two integers from the user. The values of `v_1` and `v_2` remain unchanged, and their ranges still apply. Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an input integer between 2 and 100; `d` is an input integer between 0 and 10.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer.**
