The variable `min_length` is updated by adding the current value of `min_speed` to it. The previous value of `min_length` is unchanged, and the values of `min_speed`, `max_speed`, and other variables remain as described in the initial state. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 1`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is updated to `max_length + max_speed`, `min_length` is updated to `min_length + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 1`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`**.
