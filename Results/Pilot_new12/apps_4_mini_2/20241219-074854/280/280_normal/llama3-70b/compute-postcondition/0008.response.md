To analyze the given code snippet, letâ€™s break it down.

1. **Initial State**:
    - `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
    - `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
    - `t` must be greater than or equal to 2.
    - `d` is an input integer.
    - `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.
    - `min_speed` is equal to `min(v_1, v_2)`.
    - `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`.
    - `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`.
    - `i` is `t - 1`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```
   min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
   ```

   - Here, `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.
   - `min_speed` is initially set to `min(v_1, v_2)`.
   - `max_speed` has been previously computed as `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `min_speed` changes due to the execution of the code.
   - Since `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of its previous value plus `d` (which can increase it) or `max_speed`, it ensures that `min_speed` does not exceed `max_speed`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The updated value of `min_speed` will be `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.
   - The other variables remain unchanged since only `min_speed` is updated.

Thus, the final Output State will include the updated value of `min_speed` as well as all other variables that weren't changed.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to max(max_speed - d, min_speed), `min_speed` is updated to min(min_speed + d, max_speed), `max_length` is equal to max_speed * t, `min_length` is equal to min_speed * t, `i` is t - 1.**
