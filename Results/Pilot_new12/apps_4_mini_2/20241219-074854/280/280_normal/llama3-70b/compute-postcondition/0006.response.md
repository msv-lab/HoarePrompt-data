To determine how the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we must analyze the loop statement and the variables provided.

The for loop is defined as `for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):`, which means that the loop will execute as long as `i` starts at `t - 1` and decrements until it reaches 1 (exclusive). This means that for the loop to execute, `t - 1` must be at least 1, since the loop needs to start at a value greater than 0.

Since `t` is an input integer, and the loop requires `t - 1 >= 1`, it follows that:
- \( t \) must be at least 2 (i.e., \( t \geq 2 \)) for the loop to run at all.

Additionally, we must also consider the values of `i` and its starting point:
- At the start of the loop, `i` will be `t - 1`.

To summarize:
1. The value of `t` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute.
2. The starting value of `i` will be `t - 1`.

Therefore, the required state adjustments are as follows:

State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`, `min_speed` is equal to `min(v_1, v_2), `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`, `i` is `t - 1`**
