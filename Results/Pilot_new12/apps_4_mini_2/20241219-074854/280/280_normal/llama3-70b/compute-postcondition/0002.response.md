The variable `max_speed` is assigned the value of the maximum between `v_1` and `v_2`. Both `v_1` and `v_2` are input integers that fall between 1 and 100. After executing the code, `max_speed` will hold the larger of the two integers. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; `max_speed` is the maximum value between `v_1` and `v_2`.**
