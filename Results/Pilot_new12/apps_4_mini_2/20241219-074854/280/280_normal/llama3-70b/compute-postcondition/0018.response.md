Initial State: `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `min_speed` remains unchanged, `max_length` is equal to `(t + 2) * max_speed`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`.

```
min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
```
Now, the statement assigns `min_speed` to the smaller value between `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. The value of `min_speed` changes while `max_speed` and other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`, `max_length` is equal to `(t + 2) * max_speed`, `min_length` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`**
