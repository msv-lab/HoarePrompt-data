The function reads two integers (v1 and v2) representing speeds and two integers (t and d) representing time and speed change, respectively. It computes the maximum and minimum cumulative distances covered over a given time `t`, while adjusting the speeds based on the value of `d`. The function iterates from `t-1` down to 1, updating the maximum speed by decreasing it by `d` and the minimum speed by increasing it by `d`, ensuring that the maximum does not go below the minimum speed. After executing the loop, it prints the final computed maximum distance.
