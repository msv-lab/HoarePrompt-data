You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it covers all cases as described in the problem description.

### Problem Description Review:
1. **Input speed at the beginning (v1)** and **end (v2)**.
2. **Time taken (t)** to traverse the section.
3. **Maximum speed change (d)** per second.
4. The objective is to compute the maximum possible length of the path based on the given speeds, time, and maximum speed change.

### Program Review:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)
```
### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial maximum possible distance (with the highest speed over the entire duration) is correctly calculated as `max_length = max_speed * t`.
   - The minimum speed does not change this calculation and is not subsequently used in determining the maximum length.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop starts from `t - 1` to `0` iterating downwards, adjusting max_speed and min_speed.
   - The logic `max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` allows for a decrease in speed from the max speed, while ensuring it does not drop below the minimum speed encountered.
   - The logic `min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)` ensures that the min speed can increase while not exceeding the current max speed.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Final Calculation**: 
   - The final length is printed as `max_length`, which does not consider the potential needed checks or the final speed evaluations in every second before printing the total.
   - The implementation does not ensure the calculated speeds at each second (especially the last one) are valid, especially when `t` is involved. 
   - The problem requires that the speed should start at `v1` and end at `v2`. The first speed should be maintained as `v1`, and at the last second, it should allow us to verify if we meet `v2`.

### Test Case Check:
1. The example input given in the problem should work as expected.
2. However, if we run a test case with a strict preference for speed, such as `v1 = 1, v2 = 100, d = 1, t = 100`, we would need to configure exactly how the speeds change over `t`. The program might miscalculate the total length due to improper handling of speed variations and guarantees on starting and ending velocities.

### Conclusion:
Incorrect calculations of maximum speed build-up versus the requirement to keep speed consistent with `v1` and `v2` creates a condition in which the output can be incorrect under certain circumstances.

Thus, the conclusion is:
Correctness: **False**.


Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers in the range 1 to 100, t is an integer in the range 2 to 100, and d is an integer in the range 0 to 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        
        max_length += max_speed
        
        min_length += min_speed
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v_1` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `v_2` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is updated to `max(v_1, v_2) - (t - 1) * d`, `min_speed` is updated to `min(v_1, v_2) + (t - 1) * d`, `max_length` is equal to the cumulative sum over `t - 1` iterations, `min_length` is equal to the cumulative sum over `t - 1` iterations.`
    print(max_length)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers (v1 and v2) representing speeds and two integers (t and d) representing time and speed change, respectively. It computes the maximum and minimum cumulative distances covered over a given time `t`, while adjusting the speeds based on the value of `d`. The function iterates from `t-1` down to 1, updating the maximum speed by decreasing it by `d` and the minimum speed by increasing it by `d`, ensuring that the maximum does not go below the minimum speed. After executing the loop, it prints the final computed maximum distance.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
