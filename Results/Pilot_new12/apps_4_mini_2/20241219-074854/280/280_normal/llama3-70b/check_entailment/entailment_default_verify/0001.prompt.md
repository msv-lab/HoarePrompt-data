You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's first analyze the problem description and the logic of the code. The task is to calculate the maximum possible length of the path taken by a car given the following parameters: initial speed (`v1`), final speed (`v2`), total duration (`t`), and maximum speed change between seconds (`d`).

### Analyzing the Code

1. **Inputs**: 
   - The program reads two speeds `v1` and `v2` and then reads two integers `t` and `d`.
   
2. **Calculating Maximum Length**:
   - The initial `max_length` is calculated as `max_speed * t`, where `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`.
   - The program attempts to adjust the speeds within the bounds defined by `d`, calculating the maximum length by adding the adjusted `max_speed` during each second of travel.

3. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop is designed to run `t-1` times as the speeds are adjusted for each second before reaching the last second.
   - The adjustments made within the loop ensure that the speed does not drop below `min_speed` and does not exceed the previously calculated `max_speed`.

4. **Output**: 
   - Finally, the program prints the `max_length`.

### Finding Potential Edge Cases
To assert whether the program is correct, we need to find any scenarios where the program's logic may fail to produce the correct maximum length value.

**Test Case Consideration**:
1. **Example Case**:
   - Take `v1 = 1`, `v2 = 3`, `t = 4`, and `d = 1`. In this case:
     - The maximum speeds can be adjusted as follows: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2`.
     - Total length would be `1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 8`. However, the code would potentially not account for the maximum achievable distance optimally over the first `t` seconds. 
     - The code does not ensure that speeds calculated at each second are the optimal ones while considering both the start and end limits effectively.

2. **Another Example**:
   - Let’s try `v1 = 2`, `v2 = 10`, `t = 5`, and `d = 2`. 
     - The speeds could be `2`, `4`, `6`, `8`, and `10`. Total distance would add up to `30`.
     - However, the code might fail to account for alternate maximum velocity transitions effectively within the limits leading up to `v2`.

### Conclusion
These observations lead to a conclusion that although it seems like the code handles simple cases, it fails in complex transitions of speed and is unable to guarantee that the result calculated always corresponds to the optimal path length.

Thus, there exist potential cases where the program produces incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers (v1 and v2) representing speeds and two integers (t and d) representing time and speed change, respectively. It computes the maximum and minimum cumulative distances covered over a given time `t`, while adjusting the speeds based on the value of `d`. The function iterates from `t-1` down to 1, updating the maximum speed by decreasing it by `d` and the minimum speed by increasing it by `d`, ensuring that the maximum does not go below the minimum speed. After executing the loop, it prints the final computed maximum distance.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
