To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it covers all cases as described in the problem description.

### Problem Description Review:
1. **Input speed at the beginning (v1)** and **end (v2)**.
2. **Time taken (t)** to traverse the section.
3. **Maximum speed change (d)** per second.
4. The objective is to compute the maximum possible length of the path based on the given speeds, time, and maximum speed change.

### Program Review:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)
```
### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial maximum possible distance (with the highest speed over the entire duration) is correctly calculated as `max_length = max_speed * t`.
   - The minimum speed does not change this calculation and is not subsequently used in determining the maximum length.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop starts from `t - 1` to `0` iterating downwards, adjusting max_speed and min_speed.
   - The logic `max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` allows for a decrease in speed from the max speed, while ensuring it does not drop below the minimum speed encountered.
   - The logic `min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)` ensures that the min speed can increase while not exceeding the current max speed.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Final Calculation**: 
   - The final length is printed as `max_length`, which does not consider the potential needed checks or the final speed evaluations in every second before printing the total.
   - The implementation does not ensure the calculated speeds at each second (especially the last one) are valid, especially when `t` is involved. 
   - The problem requires that the speed should start at `v1` and end at `v2`. The first speed should be maintained as `v1`, and at the last second, it should allow us to verify if we meet `v2`.

### Test Case Check:
1. The example input given in the problem should work as expected.
2. However, if we run a test case with a strict preference for speed, such as `v1 = 1, v2 = 100, d = 1, t = 100`, we would need to configure exactly how the speeds change over `t`. The program might miscalculate the total length due to improper handling of speed variations and guarantees on starting and ending velocities.

### Conclusion:
Incorrect calculations of maximum speed build-up versus the requirement to keep speed consistent with `v1` and `v2` creates a condition in which the output can be incorrect under certain circumstances.

Thus, the conclusion is:
Correctness: **False**.
