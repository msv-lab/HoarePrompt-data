You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it based on the problem description and check whether it handles all possible edge cases correctly.

1. **Understanding of Requirements**:
   - The car's speed starts at `v1` and ends at `v2` over a duration of `t` seconds.
   - The speed can change at most by `d` meters per second between each second.
   - The task is to determine the maximum possible distance traveled over those `t` seconds.

2. **Program Review**:
   - The program initializes a list `speeds` for storing speed at each second, starting with `v1` at the first second and `v2` at the last second.
   - It iteratively calculates the speed for each second, ensuring that each speed does not exceed the limits set by the maximum speed change `d`.
   - Finally, it sums up the speeds to calculate the total distance traveled.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The line `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` may not guarantee that the speeds remain valid throughout the entire period. Specifically, it calculates a new speed based on the previous speed and the maximum increment, but it also restricts it by what the future speeds need to be (towards `v2`).
   - In particular, it does not account for decrements effectively, which may lead to incorrect speeds for earlier seconds if the speeds must drop towards `v2` too significantly.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - Let's consider a test case where:
     ```
     Input:
     1 10
     10 1
     ```
     Expected speeds could be: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`.
     The program modifies the speeds incorrectly beyond the limits dictated by speed decrement at the beginning.

5. **Conclusion**:
Since the program may fail to correctly implement the logic of maintaining valid speeds through decrements to reach `v2`, we can deduce a specific case where it doesn't meet the problem requirements. This indicates that there is a potential fault in the logic.

Therefore, the Correctness of the program is: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers in the range 1 to 100, t is an integer in the range 2 to 100, and d is an integer in the range 0 to 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v_1` is in the range 1 to 100; `v_2` is in the range 1 to 100; `t` is greater than or equal to 2; `d` is in the range 0 to 10; `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d); speeds[2]` is equal to `min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d); ...; speeds[t-1]` is equal to `min(speeds[t-2] + d, v_2 + 0 * d);` and `i` is `t-1`.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer inputs: v1 and v2 (both representing speeds initialized with values between 1 and 100), t (the number of time intervals, with a minimum value of 2), and d (the maximum increment in speed, ranging from 0 to 10). It calculates a list of speeds over t time intervals, starting from v1 and ending at v2, while ensuring that the speed at each intermediate time doesn't exceed the previously calculated speed plus d or the maximum speed that could be achieved based on remaining time intervals. After computing these speeds, the function sums all the speeds in the list and prints the total distance covered as a result. Edge cases include handling the upper limits of speed increments, where the speed may either plateau or not increase if d is zero, and ensuring the starting and ending speeds are adhered to. The final state of the program after execution is the output of the total distance calculated from the speeds array.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
