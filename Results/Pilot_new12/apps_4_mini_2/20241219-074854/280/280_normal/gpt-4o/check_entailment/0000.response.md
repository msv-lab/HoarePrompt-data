To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic in the function `func()` with respect to the problem description.

1. The first line reads the initial speed `v1` and final speed `v2`.
2. The second line reads the time `t` and the maximum change in speed `d`.
3. It initializes an array `speeds` that will store speed at each second, setting the first element to `v1` and the last element to `v2`. 
4. A loop is then used to fill in the speeds for the intermediate seconds, but it only considers constraints based on previously set speeds.

The main issue in the program lies in how it populates the speeds array. In the current implementation:

```python
for i in range(1, t):
    speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

This logic doesn't ensure that the speeds are feasible for all scenarios. Specifically, the speed for the last second is directly influenced by the constructed formula `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`, which may lead to incorrect values if `v2` cannot actually be reached from the previous speeds.

### Example Case
Consider the situation where:
- `v1 = 1`
- `v2 = 10`
- `t = 3`
- `d = 5`

According to the program:
1. `speeds[0]` is set to `1`
2. `speeds[2]` is set to `10`

However, in the loop:
- For `i = 1`: `speeds[1]` would calculate using the `min` function. Here:
  - `speeds[0] + d` is `1 + 5 = 6`
  - `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d` is `10 + (3 - 1 - 1) * 5 = 10 + 0 = 10`
  Thus, `speeds[1]` would be set to `min(6, 10)`, resulting in `6`.

For the complete speed array, we end up with {1, 6, 10}. 

Calculating the total distance leads to:
- Total distance = 1 + 6 + 10 = 17 meters.

However, with the correct speeds respecting the constraints of `d`, the possible speeds should be:
- {1 (0s), 6 (1s), 10 (2s)} should indeed be valid, but intermediate configurations may not uphold the maximum speed change of d over all transitions. 

So, while the program may seem to yield an answer that doesn't break the expected bounds, the logic used to fill `speeds` doesn't thoroughly account for the possible speeds one could attain in relation to both `v2` and the stipulated change of maximum `d`.

Hence the function may return incorrect distances for certain inputs, especially those with rapid maximum changes allowed for speeds and those with stricter limits on final speeds.

Thus, I conclude that:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program could mistakenly provide an incorrect path length under various valid constraints that should yield different outputs.
