The code creates a list called `speeds` with `t` elements, all initialized to `0`. The values of `v_1`, `v_2`, and `d` remain unchanged, and the variable `t` determines the length of the list. 

Since `t` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, the `speeds` list will have a size of at least 2 and at most 100. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the newly created list.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `v_2` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` is an integer in the range 0 to 10, `speeds` is a list of length `t`, initialized to [0, 0, ..., 0] (t times)**.
