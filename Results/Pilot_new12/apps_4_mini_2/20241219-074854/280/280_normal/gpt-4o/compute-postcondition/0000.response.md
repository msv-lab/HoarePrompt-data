The values of `v_1` and `v_2` are assigned the values read from input, split into two integers. The initial bounds for `v_1` and `v_2` are retained, as they are still integers in the range 1 to 100. The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`v_1` and `v_2` are integers in the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, and `d` is an integer in the range 0 to 10; `v1` is assigned with the first input integer, `v2` is assigned with the second input integer.**
