According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the limit defined by `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. Given that `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 3 (since `i` will be incremented to 3), and the next value of `i` will be 3.

State: **`v_1` is in the range 1 to 100; `v_2` is in the range 1 to 100; `t` must be greater than 3; `d` is in the range 0 to 10; `speeds[1]` is equal to min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d); `speeds[2]` is equal to min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d); `i` is 3**
