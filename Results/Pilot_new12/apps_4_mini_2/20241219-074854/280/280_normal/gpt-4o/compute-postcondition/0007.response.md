According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `t`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than or equal to 2, which means the loop can execute again for `i = 2`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `t` must also be at least 3 to allow for another full iteration after this one.

State: **`v_1` is in the range 1 to 100, `v_2` is in the range 1 to 100, `t` must be greater than or equal to 3, `d` is in the range 0 to 10, `speeds` is updated such that `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `i` is 2**
