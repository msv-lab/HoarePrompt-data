According to the code, for the loop to execute, we need to consider the range specified in the loop statement `for i in range(1, t):`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 1, as the starting point of the range is 1 and it will iterate up to `t - 1`. Given that `t` is in the range of 2 to 100, this condition is inherently satisfied.

1. The variable `i` should start at 1 because the loop begins at that index.
2. Since there will be no iteration if `t` is equal to 1, `t` must indeed be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute.

The other variables (`v_1`, `v_2`, `d`, and `speeds`) do not impact whether the loop executes, as they are not directly linked to the control of the loop. 

Thus, the adjusted states need to convey that `t` must be at least 2 and that `i` will start at 1 during the first iteration.

State: **`v_1` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `v_2` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is an integer in the range 0 to 10, `speeds` is a list [v_1, 0, ..., 0, v_2], `i` is 1**
