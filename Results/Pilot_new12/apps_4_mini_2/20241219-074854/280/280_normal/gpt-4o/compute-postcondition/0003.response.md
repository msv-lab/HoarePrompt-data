The code assigns the value of `v_1` to the first element of the `speeds` list. Since `v_1` is an integer in the range of 1 to 100, the first element of `speeds`, which was initially 0, will now be assigned the value of `v_1`. The other values in `speeds` and the values of `v_2`, `t`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `v_2` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` is an integer in the range 0 to 10, `speeds` is a list of length `t`, initialized to [v_1, 0, ..., 0] (t-1 times)**
