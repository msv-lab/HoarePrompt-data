To analyze the impact of the provided code on the initial state, we begin by recognizing the definitions of each variable:

1. `v_1` is an integer from 1 to 100.
2. `v_2` is an integer from 1 to 100.
3. `t` is an integer greater than 3.
4. `d` is an integer from 0 to 10.
5. `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
6. `speeds[2]` is equal to `min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`.
7. `i` is initialized with the value 3.

Now, we focus on the line of code:

```
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

Here, `speeds[i]` where `i = 3` will be updated.

- `speeds[i - 1]` refers to `speeds[2]`, which is already defined in the initial state.
- The second part of the minimum function involves calculating `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`, which for `i = 3` becomes `v_2 + (t - 3 - 1) * d`, simplifying to `v_2 + (t - 4) * d`.

To define the new value for `speeds[3]`:
- The new `speeds[3]` will be the minimum of `speeds[2] + d` and `v_2 + (t - 4) * d`.

Now, considering all aspects, after executing this line, we note the adjustments:

- The variable `speeds[3]` will be affected, whereas `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, `speeds[1]`, `speeds[2]`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the results of these operations. 

Output State: **`v_1` is in the range 1 to 100; `v_2` is in the range 1 to 100; `t` is greater than 3; `d` is in the range 0 to 10; `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d); `speeds[2]` is equal to `min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d); `speeds[3]` is equal to `min(speeds[2] + d, v_2 + (t - 4) * d); `i` is 3**.
