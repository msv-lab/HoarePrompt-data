To determine the new output state after executing the provided code, we analyze the initial conditions and evaluate the effect of the code snippet:

1. The initial conditions are:
   - `v_1` is in the range 1 to 100
   - `v_2` is in the range 1 to 100
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to 3
   - `d` is in the range 0 to 10
   - `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`
   - `i` is 2

2. The code `speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)` impacts the `speeds` array and the variable `i`.

3. Evaluating the expression:
   - `speeds[i - 1]` corresponds to `speeds[1]`, and we know `speeds[1] = min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`.
   - `t - i - 1` calculates to `t - 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `t - 3`.
   - Thus, we can estimate `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d` equals `v_2 + (t - 3) * d`.

4. Therefore, after executing the code, the value assigned to `speeds[2]` will be computed as `speeds[2] = min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`.

5. Since `i` is updated from 2 to 2 (it remains the same in this context), we maintain `i` as 2.

Now, we summarize the output state by retaining all valid conditions while updating the relevant calculations. 

Output State: **`v_1` is in the range 1 to 100; `v_2` is in the range 1 to 100; `t` must be greater than or equal to 3; `d` is in the range 0 to 10; `speeds[1]` is equal to min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d); `speeds[2]` is equal to min(min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d); `i` is 2.**
