Since the provided code only contains a print statement, it does not alter any variables or their states. The output will reflect the value of `total_distance`, which is based on prior computations involving the `speeds` array and other variables.

Output State: **`v_1` is in the range 1 to 100; `v_2` is in the range 1 to 100; `t` is greater than or equal to 2; `d` is in the range 0 to 10; `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d); speeds[2]` is equal to `min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d); ...; speeds[t-1]` is equal to `min(speeds[t-2] + d, v_2 + 0 * d); total_distance` is equal to `sum(speeds[1] to speeds[t-1]); and total_distance is printed.`
