To determine the output state, we begin by analyzing the code and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `v_1` is an integer in the range 1 to 100
- `v_2` is an integer in the range 1 to 100
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2
- `d` is an integer in the range 0 to 10
- `speeds` is a list [v_1, 0, ..., 0, v_2] (which has `t` elements total, with `speeds[0] = v_1` and `speeds[t-1] = v_2`)
- `i` is 1

Now we analyze the line of code:

```
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

- Here, `speeds[i]` (which is `speeds[1]`) is being modified.
- `speeds[i - 1]` (which is `speeds[0]`) is equal to `v_1`.
- Therefore, `speeds[i - 1] + d` is `v_1 + d`.
- The term `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d` evaluates to `v_2 + (t - 1 - 1) * d`, which simplifies to `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`.
- The actual value that will be assigned to `speeds[1]` is the minimum of these two quantities.

1. Since `speeds[1]` will be either `v_1 + d` or `v_2 + (t - 2) * d`, it depends on their values.
2. Both `v_1` and `v_2` are constrained between 1 and 100, `d` is between 0 and 10, and `t` is at least 2.

After executing the code, the updated state reflects the new value of `speeds[1]`. The prior details about `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d`, and the structure of the `speeds` list all remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is in the range 1 to 100, `v_2` is in the range 1 to 100, `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is in the range 0 to 10, `speeds` is updated such that `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `i` is 1.**
