The variable `total_distance` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the `speeds` array from index 1 to `t-1`. The specific values of `speeds` depend on `v_1`, `v_2`, `d`, and `t`. 

Since `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)` and the calculations continue in a similar manner for `speeds[2]` to `speeds[t-1]`, we can assert that `total_distance` will be the cumulative sum of all the calculated speeds up to `speeds[t-1]`.

Other variables remain unaffected, and we cannot specify the exact numerical value of `total_distance` without knowing specific values for `v_1`, `v_2`, `d`, and `t`. Therefore, the output will include the valid preconditions along with the new value for `total_distance`.

Output State: **`v_1` is in the range 1 to 100; `v_2` is in the range 1 to 100; `t` is greater than or equal to 2; `d` is in the range 0 to 10; `speeds[1]` is equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d); speeds[2]` is equal to `min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d); ...; speeds[t-1]` is equal to `min(speeds[t-2] + d, v_2 + 0 * d); total_distance` is equal to `sum(speeds[1] to speeds[t-1])`.**
