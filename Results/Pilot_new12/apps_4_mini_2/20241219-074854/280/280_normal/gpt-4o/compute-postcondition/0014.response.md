The function `func` accepts three parameters: `v_1`, `v_2`, and `d`. Both `v_1` and `v_2` are integers in the range of 1 to 100, while `t` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100, and `d` is an integer in the range of 0 to 10. Since no specific outputs are provided in the prompt, we cannot outline the cases or return behavior clearly. However, we know that outputs would depend on the specific conditions met by `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters v_1, v_2, t, and d, with specified integer range constraints on each parameter.**
