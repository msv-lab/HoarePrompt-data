`speeds[-1]` is assigned the value `v_2`, modifying the last element of the `speeds` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `v_1` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `v_2` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` is an integer in the range 0 to 10, and `speeds` is a list containing `v_1` at the first index and `v_2` at the last index, with zeros in between.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `v_2` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` is an integer in the range 0 to 10, `speeds` is a list [v_1, 0, ..., 0, v_2] (with t-1 zeros).**
