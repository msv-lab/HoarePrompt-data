The code assigns values to `t` and `d` using the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes input, splits it into two parts, and converts them into integers. The specific values of `t` and `d` will depend on the input provided but must be within the specified ranges: `t` in the range 2 to 100 and `d` in the range 0 to 10. The values of `v_1` and `v_2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v_1` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `v_2` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, `d` is an integer in the range 0 to 10**.
