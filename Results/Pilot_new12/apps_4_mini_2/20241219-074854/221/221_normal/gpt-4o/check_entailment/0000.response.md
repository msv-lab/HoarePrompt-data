Correctness: **False**.

The program does not implement the required logic to count all possible ordered pairs (a, b) given the constraints of their sum (s) and their bitwise XOR (x). The current function only contains two lines of code that attempt to use the XOR operation, but it does not effectively compute or return the number of valid pairs.

For example, consider the input pair (s = 9, x = 5). The function should calculate and print the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy both conditions:

1. a + b = s
2. a ^ b = x

However, the implemented code is insufficient to solve the problem and does not account for edge cases or the logic required to obtain the correct solution. Thus, it fails to return the expected results for this and other test cases.
