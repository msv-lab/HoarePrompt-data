You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not implement the required logic to count all possible ordered pairs (a, b) given the constraints of their sum (s) and their bitwise XOR (x). The current function only contains two lines of code that attempt to use the XOR operation, but it does not effectively compute or return the number of valid pairs.

For example, consider the input pair (s = 9, x = 5). The function should calculate and print the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy both conditions:

1. a + b = s
2. a ^ b = x

However, the implemented code is insufficient to solve the problem and does not account for edge cases or the logic required to obtain the correct solution. Thus, it fails to return the expected results for this and other test cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` performs a bitwise XOR operation using a non-invasive approach. It initializes a variable `a` with the result of the bitwise XOR between `b` (which is assumed to be defined globally or outside this function) and `x`. Then, it computes a new value for `b` by XORing `a` with `x`. However, the function does not accept any parameters, nor does it return any value. Additionally, there is an undefined variable `b`, which indicates that the function cannot operate independently as it relies on a pre-existing state of `b`. After execution, the final state of `b` and `a` will reflect the results of the XOR operations. The function does not account for edge cases such as the absence of the variable `b` or the initial state of `b` not being defined, which could lead to runtime errors. Overall, the function's intent seems to be to manipulate the state of `b` through the XOR operation with `x`, but it lacks proper structure for parameter acceptance and output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
