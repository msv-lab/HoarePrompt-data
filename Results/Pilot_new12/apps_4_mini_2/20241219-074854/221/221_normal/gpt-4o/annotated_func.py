#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` performs a bitwise XOR operation using a non-invasive approach. It initializes a variable `a` with the result of the bitwise XOR between `b` (which is assumed to be defined globally or outside this function) and `x`. Then, it computes a new value for `b` by XORing `a` with `x`. However, the function does not accept any parameters, nor does it return any value. Additionally, there is an undefined variable `b`, which indicates that the function cannot operate independently as it relies on a pre-existing state of `b`. After execution, the final state of `b` and `a` will reflect the results of the XOR operations. The function does not account for edge cases such as the absence of the variable `b` or the initial state of `b` not being defined, which could lead to runtime errors. Overall, the function's intent seems to be to manipulate the state of `b` through the XOR operation with `x`, but it lacks proper structure for parameter acceptance and output.
