The function `func` accepts two parameters: `s` and `x`. Parameter `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^12, and parameter `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12. Additionally, it is required that `s` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the difference `(s - x)` must be even. 

The functionality of the function is to evaluate these parameters and return a result based on the previously mentioned conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `s` (a positive integer between 2 and 10^12) and `x` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12) with the constraints that `s` must be greater than or equal to `x` and `(s - x)` must be even.**
