Output State: **`s` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^12, `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12, `s >= x`, (`s - x`) is even, `count` is the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a` is in the range from 1 to `s-1`, `b` is equal to `s - a`, and the condition `a XOR b` equals `x` holds true. If the loop does not execute, `count` remains 0.**
