#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a positive integer between 2 and 10^12, and x is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12. Also, s must be greater than or equal to x, and (s - x) must be even.
def func():
    s, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^12, `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12, `s >= x`, (`s - x`) is even, `count` is the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a` is in the range from 1 to `s-1`, `b` is equal to `s - a`, and the condition `a XOR b` equals `x` holds true. If the loop does not execute, `count` remains 0.
    print(count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, `s` (a positive integer between 2 and 10^12) and `x` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12), from standard input, ensuring that `s` is greater than or equal to `x` and that `s - x` is even. It then counts the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `a` is between 1 and `s-1`, `b` equals `s - a`, and the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` equals `x`. The function finally prints the count of such valid pairs. There are no output values returned, but the function's output is dependent on valid pairs being formed under the XOR condition, and it correctly initializes the count to zero, ensuring that edge cases where no pairs are found are handled. Missing functionality includes checks for edge cases where invalid input conditions may occur (even though they are assumed to be validated before the function call) and consideration for cases when there are no valid pairs (the printed output would be zero).
