Functionality: **The function reads an integer input representing a camera angle in degrees (stored in `x`), where `-10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. It normalizes `x` to lie within the range of 0 to 359 degrees by applying a modulo operation (x % 360). If the normalized angle (`x`) is 0, it prints `0`, indicating no rotation. For any other normalized angle, it calculates a value derived from `((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)`, which translates the angle into a quadrant-like value (0 to 3). This value corresponds to a specific state of directional rotation based on the normalized angle, representing four possible orientations (0 for 0 degrees, 1 for 90 degrees, 2 for 180 degrees, and 3 for 270 degrees). The function does not return anything; it only prints the result. There are no edge cases handled for values exceeding the valid range for angles, nor does it manage input types that are not integers, leaving potential inputs outside of the specified domain unaddressed.**
