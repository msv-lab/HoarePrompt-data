The variable `x` is modified by the operation `x = x % 360`, where the modulo operation will yield a remainder when `x` is divided by 360. Since `x` can take on any integer value between -10^18 and 10^18, this operation effectively normalizes `x` to a range of -359 to 359 degrees. 

The other conditions are still valid, so the output state is:
`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, and now `x` is equal to `x % 360`, resulting in a value between -359 and 359.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, now `x` is equal to `x % 360`, resulting in a value between -359 and 359.**
