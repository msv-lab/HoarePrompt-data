To analyze the given code snippet, we need to first consider the properties of variable `x`.

Initial State:
- `x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18
- `x` is equal to `x % 360` resulting in a value between -359 and 359.
- `x` is not equal to 0.

From the properties of `x`:
- Since `x % 360` means `x` will be converted to a corresponding angle within 0 to 360 degrees, only values between -359 and 359 are valid.
- The expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` determines the quadrant or the offset of `x + 90`.

Calculating the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`:

1. **Adjust `x` by adding 90 and subtracting 1**:
   - If let's assume `x = -90`, then `(-90 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` becomes `(-1) // 90 % 4`, which equals `0`.
   - For values of `x` from 1 to 359, as you increment `x`, this whole expression will yield results from 0 to 3 based on where the adjusted angle (`x + 90 - 1`) falls in relation to the ranges of 90.
  
2. **Use the general formula derived from x**:
   - `x + 90 - 1 = x + 89`
   - The operation `(x + 89) // 90` will produce integer division where the result becomes 0 for values between -90 to 0, incrementing as `x` increases.
   - The `% 4` finalizes which quadrant `x + 90` corresponds to, indicating 0 for angles in [0, 90), 1 for angles in [90, 180), 2 for [180, 270), and 3 for [270, 360).

Since the code is simply printing the value of that expression, it doesn't change any states or values in `x`. After executing the print statement, there is no change in variable states apart from computing the print value.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `x` is equal to `x % 360` resulting in a value between -359 and 359, and `x` is not equal to 0; the output of the print statement is `((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)` which would yield values between 0 to 3.**
