The value of `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input that represents the camera angle in degrees and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous constraints on `x` remain valid. After the execution of the code, `x` will hold a specific integer value based on user input. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, representing the camera angle in degrees, where positive values denote clockwise rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation (value is now the user input integer).**
