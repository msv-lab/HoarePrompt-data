The provided Python program aims to calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to align a camera image based on its initial angle, which is either positive (indicating clockwise rotation) or negative (indicating counter-clockwise rotation).

Let's break down the program's logic step-by-step and verify its correctness against the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an angle `x`. The problem states this angle can range from -10^18 to 10^18, which the program accommodates by taking an integer input.

2. **Normalization of Angle**: The line `x = x % 360` normalizes the angle `x` to be within the range of 0 to 359 degrees. This is in line with the problem description, which implies that any angle can be expressed in terms of its equivalency within a circle (0 to 360 degrees).

3. **Handling Zero Case**: The program correctly identifies if the normalized angle is exactly 0. In this case, it outputs `0` turns required, which is correct since no rotations are needed when the camera aligns perfectly.

4. **Non-zero Case Calculation**: For any other angle, the logic `print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)` calculates how many 90-degree clockwise rotations are necessary to bring the deviation down to a minimum:
   - `(x + 90 - 1)` effectively shifts the angle to count how many complete 90-degree segments we can make without going under, taking care of rounding down since Python's integer division (`//`) will truncate towards zero.
   - The modulo operation `% 4` maps the result to the four possible orientations (0 to 3), which corresponds accurately to the requirements outlined: 0 for 0 degrees, 1 for 90 degrees, 2 for 180 degrees, and 3 for 270 degrees.

Through this logic, the program provides correct output values that correspond to the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise rotations needed, regardless of whether the original angle was positive or negative.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the solution required by the problem description. It considers every possible input within the defined range and calculates the necessary output as specified.

Correctness: **True**
