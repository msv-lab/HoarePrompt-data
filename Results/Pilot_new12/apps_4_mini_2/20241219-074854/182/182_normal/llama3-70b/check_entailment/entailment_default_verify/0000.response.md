Based on the provided problem description, the code functionality, the original assessment, and the output hints, the program fundamentally does not meet the requirements as outlined.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `x`, interpreted as the camera angle, which is accepted correctly.
2. **Angle Normalization**: The program correctly normalizes `x` using `x % 360`, which allows it to handle angles beyond the standard range effectively.
3. **Handling Zero Degrees**: The output for zero degrees is accurately handled by printing `0`, which is correct behavior for no camera rotation.
4. **Computing Required Turns**: This is where the significant issue arises:
    - For positive angles, the turn computation seems to yield the expected results. For instance, input `60` correctly yields `1`.
    - However, for negative angles, such as `-60`, the calculation fails to produce the correct output. The expected output is `3` (as derived from the example cases in the description), but the code outputs `0` when it should compute the proper number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed.

The program does not handle the negative input scenario properly, failing in a critical area of the described requirements, which is essential for its correctness. Thus, the original assessment stating the program is correct has omitted this crucial failure point.

Considering the above reasoning, it is clear that the program does not function as required for some test cases. Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **False**
