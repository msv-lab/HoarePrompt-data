You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.

One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget — a rotating camera — come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?

But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.

Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.

Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.

The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to "true up". [Image] 

The next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] 


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative — counter-clockwise.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.


-----Examples-----
Input
60

Output
1

Input
-60

Output
3



-----Note-----

When the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from "true up" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.

From 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.
Program:
```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if x == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we can analyze how it handles the rotation angles and whether it satisfies all possible cases described.

1. The input values can be any integer from \(-10^{18}\) to \(10^{18}\).
2. The camera rotation must be interpreted as a clockwise rotation, with the problem requiring the output of how many 90-degree clockwise turns are necessary to minimize the deviation from vertical.

Let's review how the program processes the input:

- It reads an integer \(x\) from input.
- It reduces \(x\) modulo 360 to determine the effective angle of rotation (since angles are periodic every 360 degrees).
- If \(x\) becomes 0 after modulo, it prints 0 because no rotation is necessary.
- For other angles, the program calculates how many 90-degree clockwise turns are necessary by using the formula \((x + 90 - 1) // 90 \% 4\), which effectively gives the number of complete 90-degree rotations that will bring the image closer to vertical.

However, there is a flaw when interpreting angles that are negative or non-multiples of 90. 

For example:
- Let's consider \(x = -60\). After applying modulo 360, this becomes \(x = 300\). According to the formula:
  - \(300 + 90 - 1 = 389\), and \((389 // 90) \% 4\) results in \(3\). 
  - Which means it indicates 3 rotations, as expected from the example in the problem statement.

- Another example is \(x = 60\):
  - Here, modulo gives \(60\), and the calculation yields \(1\) rotation, which is also correct.

Yet, if we try another edge case such as \(x = -90\):
- After modulo, it becomes \(270\).
- The formula would give \((270 + 90 - 1) // 90 \% 4 = (359 // 90) \% 4 = 3\), which indicates we would need 3 turns to correct this, which indeed is correct, in terms of calculation.
  
However, if we look closely at the overall logic, the formula \((x + 90 - 1) // 90\) directly computes the ceil value of dividing by \(90\). This could misbehave when negative angles that round to 0 or 1 may need correction in a different way.

The flaw lies in the handling of angles specifically when they result in a non-zero value after being reduced:
- When \(x = -1\), it returns \((359 // 90) \% 4 = 3\).
- However, beyond handling simple configurations of \(x\), there seems to be no checks for additional adjustments or edge conditions stated in the problem description.

Since we found cases that execute and compute expected results but could inherently misbehave with general cases (particularly angles leading to an unexpected modulo outcome), the assessment concludes:

Correctness: **False**

Failing to handle cases like \(x = 1\), could lead to a wrong decision about how many rotations are necessary. The implementation covers most base cases but does violate the general requirement for all inputs defined in the input range.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, representing the camera angle in degrees, where positive values denote clockwise rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    if (x == 0) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18. If `x` is equal to 0, the output value printed is 0. Otherwise, `x` is in the range from -359 to 359 (excluding 0), and the output of the print statement is `((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)`, yielding values between 0 to 3.
