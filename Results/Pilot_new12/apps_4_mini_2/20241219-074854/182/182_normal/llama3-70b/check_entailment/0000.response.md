To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the described requirements, let's analyze the logic step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `x` which represents the camera angle. The input is correctly interpreted as an angle in degrees.

2. **Angle Normalization**: The program computes `x % 360` to get the effective angle after considering full rotations. This is correct for handling angles that may be greater than 360 degrees or less than -360 degrees.

3. **Handling Zero Degrees**: If the normalized angle (`x`) is 0, meaning the camera has not rotated, the program correctly outputs 0, which is correct.

4. **Computing Required Turns**: For any angle other than 0, the program calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical.
   - The expression `((x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4)` is an attempt to compute the number of 90-degree turns needed. However, let's analyze how this works:
     - For positive angles (e.g., `60`), it calculates:
       - `60 + 90 - 1 = 149`, which gives `149 // 90 = 1`
       - Then `1 % 4 = 1`, which is correct for the example input of `60`, giving one turn.
     - For negative angles (e.g., `-60`), normalizing gives `300`, and:
       - `300 + 90 - 1 = 389`, which gives `389 // 90 = 4`
       - Then `4 % 4 = 0`, which is incorrect because it should output `3` turns instead of `0` for a `-60` degrees input.

Considering a counter-clockwise rotation introduces extra complexity in terms of its output. The output for the negative angles is not accurate, as it doesn't properly calculate turns for angles like `-60`.

For instance, if we have:
- Input `-60`, the expected output is `3` turns (as per the example in the description) to bring it to vertical.
- The current program incorrectly outputs `0`, which is a clear violation of the requirements.

Thus, we have at least one case (the negative input) where the program does not perform as required.

Correctness: **False**.
