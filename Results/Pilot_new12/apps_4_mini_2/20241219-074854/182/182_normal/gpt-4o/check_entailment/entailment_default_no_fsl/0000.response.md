Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in how it calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical.

1. For a positive angle (e.g., `60`), the program correctly calculates `1` turn, as in the example.
2. For a negative angle (e.g., `-60`), the expected output is `3`, but while the output calculation does align with certain expected values, the algorithm used to derive the turns isn't finding the minimum deviation for all cases effectively. Specifically, it does not properly account for cases where the deviation can be smaller by making more rotations than calculated directly (i.e., the modulus operation leads to some configurations being skipped).

For example:
- Input of `-90` should yield `2` clockwise turns (counter-clockwise it’s straight down), but the program would incorrectly calculate it as needing `0` because it computes the normalized angle and misses the required turns based on how it normalizes negative angles.

Thus, the overall logic for determining the required number of rotations isn’t robust for the full range of input angles as specified in the problem. This demonstrates that the program indeed does not work correctly for all potential edge cases, leading to the conclusion that it's incorrect.
