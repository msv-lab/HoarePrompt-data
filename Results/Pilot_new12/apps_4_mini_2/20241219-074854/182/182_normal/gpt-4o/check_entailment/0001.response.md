To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles the input and compare it with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the program logic:

1. The input angle `x` is read and normalized using the modulo operation with 360 degrees to handle any angle, positive or negative.
2. The number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to adjust the image is calculated with the following expression:
   - `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`
   
Now let's analyze this calculation in more detail:

- When `x` is `60`, the normalized angle is `60`. The calculation becomes:
  - `turns = (360 - 60) // 90 % 4` → `300 // 90 % 4` → `3 % 4` → `3`.
  - Yet, in the problem example, it states that this should return `1`. So here is a mismatch.
  
- When `x` is `-60`, the normalized angle is `300` (since `-60 % 360 = 300`). The calculation becomes:
  - `turns = (360 - 300) // 90 % 4` → `60 // 90 % 4` → `0 % 4` → `0`.
  - The expected output in the example is `3`, but the program returns `0`, leading to another failure to meet the specification.

The crucial aspect here is that the way the program calculates the required turns is incorrect according to the described logic in the problem. The problem requires consideration of the image rotation's deviation from vertical, and the program fails to account for the proper 90-degree adjustments.

Therefore, since we found:
1. That for input `60`, the expected output should be `1`, but the program gives `3`.
2. That for input `-60`, the expected output should be `3`, but the program gives `0`.

Both of these cases show that the program does not function as specified. 

Correctness: **False**
