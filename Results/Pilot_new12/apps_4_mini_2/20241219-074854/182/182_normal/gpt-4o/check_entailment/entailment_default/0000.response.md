Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code attempts to calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to align an angle to vertical. It normalizes the input angle to a range between 0 and 359 degrees. However, the formula used to calculate the number of turns `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` does not correctly account for all cases, particularly when the input angle is negative.

For instance:
1. If the input is `-60`, the normalized angle will be `300`. The formula gives `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4`, which equals `0`. This indicates that there are no turns needed, but in fact, 3 clockwise turns are needed to align the image correctly, as explained in the problem description.

Thus, while the code might correctly handle some cases, it fails to work correctly for others (specifically when the input value is negative), which makes it incorrect according to the problem specifications.
