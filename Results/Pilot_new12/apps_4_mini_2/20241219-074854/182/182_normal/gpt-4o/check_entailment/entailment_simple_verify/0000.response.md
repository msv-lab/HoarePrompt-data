Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program logic incorrectly calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns necessary to achieve minimal deviation for negative angles, specifically demonstrated by the input `-60`. The computation of `turns` does not account for the implications of a negative angle correctly, leading to incorrect outputs. The reasoning provided in the original assessment remains valid based on the problem description and the annotations of the program. Therefore, the overall conclusion regarding the program's failure to meet the requirements of the problem statement is accurate.
