To assess the correctness of the program, we need to evaluate its logic against the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The camera angle `x` (an integer) which can be any value between \(-10^{18}\) and \(10^{18}\).
2. **Output**: An integer representing the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise rotations needed to minimize the deviation from vertical.
3. **Logic**: 
   - Rotation of the image based on the input angle should be handled intelligently so that:
     - Correctly normalizes the angle considering the rotation wraps around every 360 degrees.
     - Ensures rotations are done in increments of 90 degrees clockwise.
   - The model must account for both positive and negative angles.

### Review of the Annotated Program:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())  # Accept user input
    normalized_angle = x % 360  # Normalize the angle
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4  # Calculate the number of turns
    print(turns)  # Print the result
```

### Evaluation:
1. **Normalization**:
   - The `normalized_angle = x % 360` correctly normalizes any angle to a range of \(0\) to \(359\) degrees. This takes care of both positive and negative inputs.
   
2. **Calculation of Turns**:
   - The key expression `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` seeks to determine how many 90-degree clockwise rotations are needed to bring the overall deviation to a minimal angle.
   - By taking `360 - normalized_angle`, it effectively calculates how much clockwise rotation from that normalized state is needed to reach the next full upright (vertical) position.
   - The division by `90` gives us the number of 90-degree steps required. The `% 4` ensures that it wraps around appropriately since four 90-degree turns complete a full 360-degree rotation.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program takes care of the requirements by:
     - Correctly normalizing any possible angle.
     - Making sure the number of rotations is calculated as the minimum needed to correct the image to vertical.
   - It addresses all potential input angles by leveraging modular arithmetic to effectively determine required rotations.

### Conclusion:
The program, as written, accurately implements the specified logic needed to meet the requirements of the problem description concerning rotations. It returns the minimum number of clockwise turns needed based on the input angle. 

Therefore, the final correctness decision is:

Correctness: **True**
