Given the program and the problem description, along with the original assessment provided, I will evaluate the correctness of the program using the annotations.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to adjust the image based on a given angle of rotation. Positive angles indicate clockwise rotation and negative angles indicate counter-clockwise rotation.

2. **Analyzing the Original Program**:
   - The program first normalizes the input angle `x` using modulo 360 to bring it within the range of 0 to 359 degrees.
   - It then computes the number of 90-degree turns needed by the expression:
     ```python
     turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
     ```
   - This expression does not properly account for the situation where negative angles should be treated differently because they indicate counter-clockwise rotation, which affects the necessary adjustments to return the image to a vertical position.

3. **Checking Annotated States**:
   - The program does calculate the number of required turns but fails to provide the correct output for the given examples. For instance:
     - When the input angle is `60`, the result should be `1`, but the program incorrectly yields `3` according to the assessment.
     - For input `-60`, the expected output is `3`, while the program output is `0`.
   - The overall calculation logic fails to recognize the significance of directionality (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) and thus provides incorrect outputs.

4. **Conclusion**: The original assessment accurately reflects the issues with the program:
   - The program does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem due to the incorrect calculation of the number of turns required based on the normalized angle.
  
Based on this thorough analysis:

Final: **False**
