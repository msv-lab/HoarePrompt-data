The provided program attempts to solve the problem described by processing an integer input angle `x`, normalizing it to a range between 0 and 359 degrees, and calculating the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to align the image correctly.

Let's analyze the implementation step-by-step against the problem description:

1. **Normalization**: The function normalizes the input angle `x` using `x % 360`. This effectively reduces any angle to its equivalent angle within the range [0, 360). However, the behavior of negative angles needs careful consideration. For instance, if `x` is -60, `normalized_angle` will become `300`, which corresponds to a 60 degrees counter-clockwise rotation, waiting to be corrected.

2. **Calculating Turns**: The turns are then computed using the formula:
   ```python
   turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
   ```
   This attempts to calculate how many 90-degree clockwise rotations are needed to correct the `normalized_angle` back to being effectively 'upright' (0 degrees).

   However, the formula fails for some specific conditions:
   - When `x` is positive but within 0 to 90 degrees, the needed correction turns are erroneously calculated.
   - When the angle is negative, such as -60, the calculated turns indeed yield 3, which is correct based on the reasoning provided in the problem description.

3. **Output**: The function prints the result directly but does not return any value, which is acceptable given the problem prompt specifies an integer output.

### Correctness Analysis
- The program correctly normalizes the angle and attempts to calculate the number of necessary clockwise 90-degree turns. However, it does not directly calculate the deviations as explained in the examples, and it fails for angles between certain ranges.

- Specifically, the formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` does not correctly compute or account for all input scenarios as illustrated. For instance:
  - If `x = 30`, `normalized_angle` becomes `30`, leading the formula to yield `(360 - 30) // 90 % 4`, giving 3 unnecessarily.
  
Thus, the lack of coverage for edge cases and correct counting leads the function to produce incorrect results for some valid inputs.

**Correctness: False** 

### Explanation of Incorrectness
The provided program does not accurately cover all potential input angles as requested by the problem description, particularly fails for inputs that do not lead to straightforward calculations. It fails to consistently match the required outputs, especially for angles that are less than 90 degrees but greater than 0, as well as positive angles greater than 90. Therefore, it does not satisfy the conditions outlined in the problem description properly.
