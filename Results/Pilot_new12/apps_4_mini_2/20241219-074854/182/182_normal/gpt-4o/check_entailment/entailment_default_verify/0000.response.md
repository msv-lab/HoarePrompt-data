Final: **False** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program fails to handle negative angles, leading to incorrect output for certain cases, such as when the input is `-60`. Additionally, the analysis highlights that the calculation of turns does not accommodate the full range of possible input scenarios as described in the problem statement. The output hints also confirm that the program does not adequately account for all required rotational logic, thereby supporting the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
