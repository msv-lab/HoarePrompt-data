To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we will analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Rotation**: The input is a single integer representing the angle of rotation of the camera which can be positive (clockwise) or negative (counter-clockwise).
2. **Output Requirement**: We need to determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns necessary to achieve an image with the least deviation from vertical.
3. **Rotational Logic**:
   - A positive angle indicates a clockwise rotation, and a negative angle indicates a counter-clockwise rotation.
   - The output must reflect the number of 90-degree clockwise turns necessary to minimize deviation.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)
```

1. **Normalization of Angle**: The program normalizes the angle using `x % 360`. This correctly allows for handling angles greater than 360 or less than -360.
2. **Calculation of Turns**: The formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` attempts to compute the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed. However, it does not consider that if `normalized_angle` is negative, it can lead to incorrect calculations.

### Key Failure Case:
- Consider input `x = -60`. 
  - `normalized_angle = -60 % 360` results in `normalized_angle = 300`.
  - The equation computes turns: 
    ```
    turns = (360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 60 // 90 % 4 = 0
    ```
  - This is incorrect since it should output `3`, indicating that to minimize the deviation, it requires three turns of 90 degrees clockwise.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly account for negative angles and effectively calculate the necessary number of 90-degree rotations to achieve minimal deviation.

Correctness: **False**. 

The example where the program does not work correctly is with an input of `-60`, where the expected output should be `3` but the program incorrectly calculates it as `0`.
