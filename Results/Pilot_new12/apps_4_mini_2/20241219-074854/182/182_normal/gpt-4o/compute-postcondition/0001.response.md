The variable `normalized_angle` is assigned the value of `x % 360`, which is the remainder of `x` when divided by 360. This operation ensures that `normalized_angle` will always be within the range of 0 to 359, regardless of the input value of `x`.

Since `x` can be any integer within the range of -10^18 to 10^18, `normalized_angle` will result in a value that can be expressed as `x % 360`, encompassing all valid resulting values. The initial condition regarding `x` remains valid, but `normalized_angle` will now hold a specific value based on the calculation.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`.**
