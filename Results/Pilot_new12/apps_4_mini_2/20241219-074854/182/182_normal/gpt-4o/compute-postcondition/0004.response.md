The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with an integer `x` that follows the constraint of being in the range of -10^18 to 10^18. However, the implementation details of how this input is handled and what specific output is generated are not provided. Since there is no explicit information on the output for this function, further details on the expected behavior or return value are missing. 

Thus, without any additional context or output information, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and the output is unspecified.**
