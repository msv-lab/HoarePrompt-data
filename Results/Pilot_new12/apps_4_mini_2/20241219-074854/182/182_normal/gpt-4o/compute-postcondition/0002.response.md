In this case, `turns` is assigned the value computed from the expression `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. The `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`, which will yield a value in the range of 0 to 359.

To break down the computation:
1. Calculate `normalized_angle` as `x % 360`.
2. Substitute `normalized_angle` into the expression: `(360 - (x % 360)) // 90 % 4`.

Next, depending on the value of `normalized_angle` (which varies between 0 and 359), we will derive the value for `turns`. The integer division `//` will yield one of the values as follows:
- If `normalized_angle` is 0, `turns` will be 4 (since `(360 - 0) // 90 % 4` equals `4 % 4` which is `0`).
- If `normalized_angle` is 90, `turns` will be 3.
- If `normalized_angle` is 180, `turns` will be 2.
- If `normalized_angle` is 270, `turns` will be 1.
- If `normalized_angle` is 359, `turns` will be 0 because the expression evaluates to `(360 - 359) // 90 % 4`.

However, since `turns` can only assume values between 0 and 3 after the modulo operation, all calculations still lead back to values between 0 and 3 depending on `x`.

Therefore, we conclude that the other values remain unchanged, and the only updated value is for `turns`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`; `turns` is an integer value calculated from `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, which ranges from 0 to 3.**
