The code snippet provided simply prints the value of `turns`, which has already been calculated based on the previous states of the variables. The other variables remain unchanged after this operation. Hence, the value of `turns` will be displayed as output based on the calculation from the initial state.

The initial state provided tells us that:
- `x` is some integer within the range of -10^18 to 10^18.
- `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`.
- `turns` has been calculated as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, which means it will be a value in the range of 0 to 3.

Given that the code simply prints the value of `turns`, the output will indicate that `turns` is calculated with respect to the initial state of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18; `normalized_angle` is equal to `x % 360`; `turns` is equal to `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`.**
