Functionality: **The function reads an integer input from the user, representing an angle in degrees. It normalizes this angle to a value between 0 and 359 degrees. Then it calculates the number of 90-degree turns needed to align the normalized angle to 0 degrees. The result is printed as an integer representing the number of clockwise 90-degree turns. Note that the function does not handle edge cases for non-integer inputs or values outside the specified range directly, and the function's return type is void since it only prints the result.**
