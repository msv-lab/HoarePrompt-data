To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program against the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alyona can reduce elements of the array to any smaller positive integer.
- We need to find out the maximum possible value of "mex" after applying such operations.
- "mex" is defined as the smallest positive integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The implemented function begins by:
1. Reading the integer `n` (size of the array).
2. Reading the array `a` and sorting it.
3. The variable `mex` is initialized to `1`, which represents the smallest positive integer we are checking against.
4. It then iterates through the sorted array:
   - If the current number `num` is greater than or equal to the current `mex`, it indicates we can "use" that number to represent the current value of `mex`, so `mex` is incremented by 1.
5. Finally, the function prints the resulting `mex`.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Minimum Input Size Case**: For `n = 1` and `a = [1]`, the output should be `2` because `1` is present and the next greater integer is `2`.
2. **All Unique Consecutive Elements**: For `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected output should be `6`.
3. **Gaps in the Array**: For `a = [1, 3, 5]`, the output should also be `2` and `4` should be included from modifications.
4. **Case with Maximum Elements**: An edge case where `n = 100000` and many of the elements are extremely large should still yield a theoretical `mex`, verifying the performance of the sort.
5. **All Same Elements**: If `a = [1, 1, 1]`, the output should correctly yield `2`.

### Validity of the Output:
Looking through potential inputs and their expected outputs, the provided function fulfills the necessary condition of identifying the maximum possible "mex". 

However, consider the following specific edge case:
- The function does not explicitly consider that it can't exceed `n` in the increment of `mex`. Specifically, even in the presence of duplicates or higher numbers (for example `a = [10, 10, 10]`), the correct `mex` can still be determined to be `1` since you are not limited to the values but rather only need to ensure that every positive integer less than or equal to `n` can appear.

### Conclusion:
After thorough review of the function against potential test inputs, it correctly identifies the maximum "mex" achievable after possible operations on the elements. No gaps in logic or incorrect edge case handling were found.

Correctness: **True**.
