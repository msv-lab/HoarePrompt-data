The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` containing `n` positive integers, which are read from input. It sorts the list `a` and calculates the smallest positive integer (known as the minimum excluded value, or MEX) that is not present in the list `a`. After iterating through the sorted list, it increments the MEX for each number in `a` that is equal to or greater than the current MEX. Finally, the function prints the computed MEX. The function does not return a value, and it specifically handles cases where all integers from 1 up to `n` might be present in the list, thus may return a MEX that is greater than `n`. Edge cases such as repeated numbers and gaps in the sequence of `a` are also correctly handled, ensuring that the function effectively identifies the smallest missing positive integer.
