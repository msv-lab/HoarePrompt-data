According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the sorted list `a`. The current state indicates that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, meaning that there are at least two elements in the list. The variable `num` is the second element in `a`, and since `num` is noted to be greater than or equal to 2, the loop has executed for the first element already, and there is at least one more element left for the loop to process.

The next iteration will assign `num` the value of the third element in the list `a`. For the loop to continue executing, there must still be elements in `a` for `num` to take on the next value. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least three elements in `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000) and must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with `n` greater than 2, num is the third element in the list**
