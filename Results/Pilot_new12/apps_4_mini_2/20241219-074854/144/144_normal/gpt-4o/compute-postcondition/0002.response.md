The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer satisfies the condition 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9. After sorting, the elements of `a` will be rearranged in non-decreasing order, but since `n` can be any positive integer from 1 to 100,000, the specific values in `a` will determine the result. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as does the range of values for `a[i]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, where each integer `a[i]` is obtained from input and satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9.**
