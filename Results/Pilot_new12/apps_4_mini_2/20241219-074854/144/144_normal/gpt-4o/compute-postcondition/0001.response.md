`a` is assigned a list of integers obtained from the input, converted from strings to integers using the `map` function and `int`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, so the length of the list `a` will be `n`. Each element of the list `a[i]` will be a positive integer satisfying the condition `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9`. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer `a[i]` is obtained from input and satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9.**
