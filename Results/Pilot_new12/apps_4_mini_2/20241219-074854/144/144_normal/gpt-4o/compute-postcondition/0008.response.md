According to the code, the loop iterates over the sorted list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must contain elements, and the current loop iteration should represent the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the first element in the sorted list `a` and since there is still at least one element remaining in `a`, we will have to increment our position to get the next element in the list. Consequently, `num` will need to be updated to reflect the next element in the list. Given that `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, the number of elements remaining can be inferred.

Since `num` is currently the first element and `mex` is set to 2, we need to determine if `a` has more elements beyond the first one.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with `n` must be greater than 1, `num` is the second element in `a`, `mex` is 2**
