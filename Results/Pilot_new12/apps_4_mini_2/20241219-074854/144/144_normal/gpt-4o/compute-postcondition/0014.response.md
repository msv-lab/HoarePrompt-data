To analyze the loop's output state after all iterations have executed, we consider the behavior of `mex` and its relationship to the sorted list `a`. The value of `mex` starts at 1 and increments each time an element in `a` is greater than or equal to the current value of `mex`. 

The loop iterates over each `num` in the sorted list `a`:

- **Initial observations about `mex`**:
  - If `num >= mex`, then `mex` will increment.
  - If `num` does not satisfy this condition, then `mex` will remain unchanged for that iteration.

Given the constraints:
- If all elements in `a` are less than `mex`, `mex` remains 1.
- If the elements in `a` incrementally satisfy `num >= mex`, then `mex` will reach up to `n + 1`, depending on the contents of `a`.

In the best-case scenario, when `a` consists of sequential integers starting from 1 (e.g., [1, 2, 3, ..., n]), `mex` will ultimately become `n + 1`. 

In contrast, if none of the integers in `a` are at least 1 (not possible due to constraints), `mex` would not increment and would remain 1.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop:
- The value of `mex` depends on the count of integers in `a` that are at least 1 and how many of them sequentially align with the expected integer progression.

The output state after the loop executes completely can be summarized as:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000); `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9); `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.**
