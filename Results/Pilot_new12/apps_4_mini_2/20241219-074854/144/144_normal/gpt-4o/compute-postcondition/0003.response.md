The variable `mex` is assigned the value of `1`, which is its initial value in this context. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `n` and `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `mex` is 1.**
