`mex` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with `n` greater than 1, `num` is the second element in `a`, `mex` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with `n` greater than 1, `num` is the second element in `a`, `mex` is 3.**
