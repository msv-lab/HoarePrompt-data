According to the code, the for loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, it follows that `a` must have been initialized to contain `n` integers. Since `a` is sorted and consists of positive integers, it will not be empty if `n` is at least 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` will be the last element in the list `a`, and since `mex` starts at 1, that state remains fixed unless modified in the loop.

Thus, no additional adjustments are necessary beyond confirming the values of `n` and `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers (where 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9), and `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in `a`**.
