The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The variable `n` is still a positive integer greater than 2, and `a` remains a sorted list of `n` positive integers where `num` is the third element in that list. The states of the other variables are not impacted. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000) and must be greater than 2; `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers with `n` greater than 2; `num` is the third element in the list; `mex` is incremented by 1.**
