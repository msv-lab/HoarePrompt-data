The code snippet `break` does not change the values of any variables but is used to exit from the most internal loop or control structure in which it is placed. In this case, the context is such that we are breaking out of a loop that is likely processing elements related to `arr`, `num`, and potentially affecting the calculation of `mex`.

Since no values are assigned or altered directly by the `break`, we maintain the existing state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State reflects the current conditions that remain unchanged, while acknowledging that we are breaking out of an internal loop, likely relative to those variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `num` is the next element in `arr` corresponding to the subsequent index; `mex` is adjusted based on `num` as needed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
