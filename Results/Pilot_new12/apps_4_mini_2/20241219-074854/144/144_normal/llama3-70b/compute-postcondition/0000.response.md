The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` was previously a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000, its value will now reflect an input integer that also satisfies this condition.

The state of the list `a` remains unchanged since the code snippet does not alter it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9.**
