The `arr` list is assigned the sorted version of itself, meaning the elements of `arr` are now in non-decreasing order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as the sorting operation does not affect it. The list `a` also remains unchanged, but `arr` will reflect the order of `a` sorted. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers corresponding to the original list `a`.**
