The variable `mex` is assigned the value of `1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `arr`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers corresponding to the original list `a`; and `mex` is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers corresponding to the original list `a`; `mex` is 1.**
