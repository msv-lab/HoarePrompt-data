The code executes a `print` statement for the variable `mex`, which is the smallest positive integer that is not in the sorted list `arr`. The variables `n`, `a`, and `arr` are still valid in their initial state. However, the precondition implies that `mex` has been determined prior to this code snippet.

Since `mex` is dependent on the contents of `arr`, which is derived from `a`, and without specific values or processing logic provided, I have to consider the state where `mex` has valid information based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers corresponding to `a`; `mex` is the smallest positive integer not in `arr`, printed as the output.**
