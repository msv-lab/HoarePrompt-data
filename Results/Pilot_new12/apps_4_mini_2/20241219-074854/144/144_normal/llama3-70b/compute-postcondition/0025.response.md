Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` positive integers, where each integer lies between 1 and 10^9. It processes the list by sorting it, then determines and prints the smallest positive integer that is not present in the sorted list. This integer is referred to as the 'minimum excluded value' (mex). The function correctly handles edge cases where the list may contain consecutive integers starting from 1, and it efficiently identifies the mex by breaking the loop as soon as it encounters a number greater than the current mex. The function does not return a value; instead, it outputs the mex directly. However, it does not include error handling for cases where input is invalid or outside the specified constraints.**
