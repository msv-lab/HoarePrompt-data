Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers corresponding to `a`, and `mex` is 1. If `num` (the first element of `arr`) equals `mex`, then `mex` is incremented to 2, and `num` remains 2. If `num` is not equal to `mex`, we maintain the original values with `mex` still equal to 1, and if `num` is greater than `mex`, the flow of execution is altered based on this condition.***
