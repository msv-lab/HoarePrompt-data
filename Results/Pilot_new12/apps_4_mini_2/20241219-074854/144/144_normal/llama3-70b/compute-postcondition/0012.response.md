According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, the current `num` has already been processed. If the loop is to execute one more time, it will take the next element from `arr`.

At the end of the last iteration, `mex` is either 2 (if `num` equals 1, we incremented it) or remains 1 (if `num` is not equal to `mex` and is greater than or equal to `mex`, or if `num` is not equal to `mex` and less than `mex`). To prepare for the next iteration of the loop, we expect the next `num` to be the next element in `arr` after the last processed one.

Since `arr` is sorted and has `n` elements, to have the loop execute one more time, we will need to consider that `num` will be the next element in `arr`, for which `mex` will be adjusted based on the current `num` value in comparison to `mex`.

Thus, we must set `num` to the next element in the `arr` and update `mex` based on the conditions specified.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `mex` must be adjusted based on the next element in the `arr`.**
