Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `num` is the next element in `arr` for the subsequent index. If `num` is greater than `mex`, then `mex` is adjusted based on `num`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
