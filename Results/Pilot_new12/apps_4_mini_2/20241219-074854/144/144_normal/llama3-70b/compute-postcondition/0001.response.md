`arr` is assigned the value of a list containing integers read from input and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial state does not specify the actual input values for `a`, but it indicates that `a` is a list of `n` integers and `n` is between 1 and 100,000. After the execution, `arr` will hold the same values as `a`, given they are read from input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of `n` integers equal to `a`.**
