Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the `mex` must be adjusted based on the next element in `arr` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
