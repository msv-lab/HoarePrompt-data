The values of the variables do not change; however, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `mex` must be adjusted based on the next element in the `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
