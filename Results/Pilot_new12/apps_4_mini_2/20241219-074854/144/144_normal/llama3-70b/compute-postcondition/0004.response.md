According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. The loop will iterate over every element in `arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list corresponding to the original list `a`, we can assume it has at least one element since `n` is defined to be at least 1.

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `num` will be set to the first element of `arr`. Therefore, it's important to adjust the state to reflect that. Since `arr` has elements corresponding to `a`, there should be a relationship between `arr`, `a`, and `n`.

The final state should indicate that `num` is initialized to the first element of `arr`, and it will execute for all elements in `arr`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers corresponding to `a`, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in `arr`**
