Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers corresponding to `a`; `mex` is 1; `num` is the first element in `arr`, and `num` is not equal to `mex`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, potentially altering the flow of execution based on that condition.***
