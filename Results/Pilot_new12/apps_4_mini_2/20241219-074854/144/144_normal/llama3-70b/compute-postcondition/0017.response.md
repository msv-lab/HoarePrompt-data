According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` has taken on a value from `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be assigned the next value from `arr`. 

Since `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers, if we denote the current iteration's index as `current_index`, then `num` will take on the value of `arr[current_index + 1]` in the next iteration. The loop continues until all elements in `arr` have been processed.

Given that `arr` consists of `n` elements where `n` is between 1 and 100,000, if the loop has just processed the last element (when `current_index + 1` is equal to `n`), there will be no more elements to iterate through, and the loop would exit. 

Since there is no explicit information provided about the current values of `num` or the specific current iteration index, we can infer that if `num` is not the last element in `arr`, the next state for `num` will be the subsequent element in `arr`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `num` is the next element in `arr` corresponding to the subsequent index, `mex` is adjusted based on `num` as needed.**
