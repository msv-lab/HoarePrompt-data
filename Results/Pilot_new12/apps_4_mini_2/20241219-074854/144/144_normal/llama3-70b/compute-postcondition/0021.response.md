Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `num` is the next element in `arr` corresponding to the subsequent index; if `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` is incremented by 1. If `num` is greater than `mex`, `mex` is adjusted based on the value of `num`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes to `mex` occur.***
