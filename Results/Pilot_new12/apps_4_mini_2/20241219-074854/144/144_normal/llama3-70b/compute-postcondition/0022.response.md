To analyze the final state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's summarize what we've inferred from the loop's structure.

The loop iterates over the sorted list `arr` which corresponds to the original list `a`. The variable `mex` starts at 1 and increments whenever an element in `arr` equals `mex`. If an element in `arr` is greater than `mex`, the loop terminates early.

- After executing the loop for each element in `arr`, `mex` will be incremented for each occurrence of a number that is exactly equal to the current value of `mex`.
- If there are missing integers in the sequence (i.e., if certain values do not appear in `arr`), `mex` will remain equal to those missing integers after the loop exits.

Given that `arr` is sorted, the loop processes the elements in ascending order. When it encounters an element greater than `mex`, it exits, meaning `mex` will be the smallest missing positive integer not present in `arr`.

### Output State:

If the loop executes all iterations and `mex` increments for all valid elements, then `mex` will be equal to `n + 1`, where `n` is the maximum number in `arr`. If a missing integer was encountered, `mex` will reflect the smallest missing integer.

However, depending on the situation, `mex` could end at any integer representing the smallest positive integer not found in `arr`.

Thus, we can summarize as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers corresponding to `a`, and `mex` is the smallest positive integer that is not in `arr`, determined after processing all elements.**
