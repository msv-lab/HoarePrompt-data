Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers corresponding to `a`, `mex` is now 2 (incremented from 1), and the current value of `num` (the first element in `arr`) remains equal to `mex` (currently 2).**
