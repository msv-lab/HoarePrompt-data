The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible value of mex after allowing the operations specified in the problem description. The code sorts the array, initializes the `mex` to 1, and then iterates through the sorted array to find the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the array sequence.

The program handles potential scenarios as follows:
1. When presented with consecutive integers starting from 1, it successfully identifies the mex after the highest integer in the sequence, effectively accounting for all values present.
2. When faced with gaps in the integers (e.g., an input array like `[1, 2, 4]`), it recognizes that `mex` should be the next missing integer, which is correct as per the problem's requirements.
3. In cases where an array value exceeds the current `mex`, the break statement conveniently halts unnecessary iterations, optimizing the function's performance.

Additionally, the example cases provided in the problem description validate that the implemented logic produces the correct outputs:
- For the first input case (`1 3 3 3 6`), the output is correctly computed as `5`.
- For the second input case (`2 1`), the output correctly yields `3`.

Since every potential case discussed aligns with the prescribed problem mechanics, and no edge cases are overlooked, I conclude that the function operates correctly in all scenarios as outlined.

Correctness: **True**.
