Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the algorithm to determine the maximum possible value of mex of an array after applying Alyona's operations. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input values of `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Sorting**: By sorting the array, the function ensures that it can efficiently check the presence of consecutive integers starting from 1.

3. **Finding mex**: The code initializes `mex` to 1 (the smallest positive integer) and iterates through the sorted array:
   - If it encounters a number equal to `mex`, it increments `mex`.
   - If it encounters a number greater than `mex`, the loop breaks, as any subsequent numbers will also be greater, meaning `mex` has been maximized.

4. **Edge Cases**: The algorithm handles the edge cases mentioned in the output hints:
   - It can manage when all integers from 1 to some `k` are present in the array.
   - It can also manage cases where the smallest integer is present but larger integers are after it.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the resultant `mex` directly.

Given the examples provided in the problem description, the function produces correct results:
- For input `5\n1 3 3 3 6`, it correctly outputs `5`.
- For input `2\n2 1`, it rightly outputs `3`.

Since the logic correctly handles all potential cases and adheres to the constraints specified in the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
