Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where `n` is 1, which represents the player being at the root of the tree and already at the exit. The game states that Amr starts at the root and can move based on the rules defined; however, the program's algorithm assumes that `n` will always be greater than 1 when it enters the loop. 

According to the problem description, if `n` equals 1, Amr does not visit any nodes because he is already at the exit. Therefore, the correct output should be `0` for the input `1 1`, but the program would not correctly account for this scenario due to the lack of handling for `n = 1`. 

For example, with `h = 1` and `n = 1`, the expected output should be `0`, but the code would skip the loop entirely and print `ans`, which remains `0`, leading to no output indicating the condition is unhandled. Thus, there are cases where the output will not match the problem's specification.
