The values of `h` and `n` are updated by the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes input from the user and splits it into two integers. The precondition states that `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^h inclusive. Since the initial values of `h` and `n` were variables defined within their ranges, we don't know their specific values post-execution, but they will be assigned based on user input.

Therefore, the Output State reflects this uncertainty:

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^h inclusive, both updated by user input.**
