The expression `ans += n // 2` implies that `ans` will be incremented by the integer division of `n` by 2. Given that `n` must be greater than 2, `n // 2` will produce a value of at least 1. The value of `ans` remains unchanged before this operation, but will increase based on the value of `n // 2`. 

Other variables (`h` and `ans`) retain their states but are not directly modified by this operation besides `ans`. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is unchanged, and `ans` is now increased by `n // 2`.**
