The value of `ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1`. The value of `n` is even and greater than 1, so `n // 2` is guaranteed to be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. This means `ans` will be updated to `n // 2 - 1`, effectively becoming a positive integer as well (greater than or equal to 0). The states of the other variables remain unmodified.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is greater than 1 and is even, `ans` is updated to `n // 2 - 1`**
