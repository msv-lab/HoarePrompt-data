To derive the output state after the execution of the while loop, we'll analyze the provided loop code step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive.
   - `n` is between 1 and \(2^h\) inclusive, where the minimum possible value for `n` is 1 and the maximum is \(2^{50}\) (this implies that `n` can be quite large).
   - `ans` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues while `n > 1`.
   - In each iteration of the loop, `n` is halved using integer division (`n //= 2`), which reduces the value of `n` exponentially until it becomes less than or equal to 1.
   - When `n` is even, `ans` is updated by adding \(n // 2 - 1\), and when `n` is odd, it is updated by \(n // 2\).

3. **Final Conditions**:
   - After the loop has executed, `n` will be reduced to 1 (the last state of `n` when it can no longer satisfy `n > 1`).
   - The value of `ans` will have been updated several times depending on the parity of `n` during the iterations. Each adjustment contributes to the total value of `ans`.

4. **Determining Output State**:
   - Since `n` starts at a value based on \(2^h\) and is halved until it reaches 1, we can conclude that `n` will be exactly 1 upon exiting the loop.
   - The exact final value of `ans` depends on how many times and in what manner `n` was updated through integer division.
   - Itâ€™s important to note that `h` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution, holding values between 1 and 50.

Thus, taking the above into consideration and summarizing the final states of `h`, `n`, and `ans`, we conclude:

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is 1, `ans` is the sum of contributions from each iteration derived from the original value of `n` based on its parity during division**.
