After executing the code `n //= 2`, the variable `n` is updated to its integer division by 2. Given that the initial state says `n` is greater than 2, the new value of `n` will be at least 1 (since the smallest integer greater than 2 is 3, and 3 // 2 = 1). The value of `ans` remains unchanged after this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is updated to `n // 2`, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is now `n // 2`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
