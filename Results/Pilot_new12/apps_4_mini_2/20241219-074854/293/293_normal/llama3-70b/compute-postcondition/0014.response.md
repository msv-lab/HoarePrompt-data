According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is now `n // 2`. This means that `n` must currently be at least 3 in order for `n // 2` to be greater than 1 (since `2 // 2` equals 1).

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, the initial value of `n` must have been at least 6 (to ensure that after halving it, it still remains greater than 1). So the current value of `n` must be at least 3 after the division.

State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` must be at least 3, and `ans` remains unchanged**
