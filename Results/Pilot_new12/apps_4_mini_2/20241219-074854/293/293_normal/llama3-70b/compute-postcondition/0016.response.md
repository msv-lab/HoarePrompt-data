The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `n // 2`, where `n` is at least 3. Since `n` is at least 3, `n // 2` will be at least 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` must be at least 3, and `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` must be at least 3, and `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2`**.
