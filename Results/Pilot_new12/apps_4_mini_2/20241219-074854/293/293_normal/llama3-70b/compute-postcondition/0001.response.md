The value of `ans` is initialized to 0. The previous values of `h` and `n` are not affected by this assignment, so it does not change their conditions. Therefore, the output state captures the initial conditions for `h` and `n`, and also notes that `ans` has been set.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^h inclusive, `ans` is 0.**
