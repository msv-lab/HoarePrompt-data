The function `func` accepts two parameters: `h` and `n`. `h` is an integer that must be in the range of 1 to 50 inclusive, and `n` is an integer that must be in the range of 1 to 2^h inclusive. The output of the function is not specified, but based on the constraints, it likely involves processing the values of `h` and `n` in some way. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers, `h` and `n`, with specified ranges; however, the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, h (an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive) and n (an integer between 1 and 2^h inclusive). The specific return value is not specified.**
