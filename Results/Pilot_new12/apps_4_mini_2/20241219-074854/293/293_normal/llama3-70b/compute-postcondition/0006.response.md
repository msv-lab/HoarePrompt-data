`ans` is updated by adding the value of `n // 2` to it. Given that `n` is an odd number greater than 1, `n // 2` will be an integer equal to `(n - 1) / 2`. Therefore, this means `ans` becomes `ans` + `(n - 1) / 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and `ans` now holds the new computed value.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an odd number greater than 1, `ans` is the new value equal to `ans + (n - 1) // 2**.
