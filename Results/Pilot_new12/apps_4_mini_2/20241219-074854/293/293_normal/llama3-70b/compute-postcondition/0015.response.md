The variable `ans` is updated by adding the integer division of `n` by 2, subtracting 1. The variable `n` must be at least 3, so `n // 2` will be at least 1. The value of `ans` remains unchanged except for the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is at least 3, and `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is at least 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`**.
