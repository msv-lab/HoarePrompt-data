The code `ans += n // 2 - 1` computes the new value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `n // 2 - 1`. The variable `n` must be greater than 2 as per the initial state. The initial value of `h` remains between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `ans` is changed by the operation.

The expression `n // 2 - 1` divides `n` by 2 using integer division and then subtracts 1 from the result. Since `n` must be greater than 2, the minimum value of `n // 2` will be 1 (if `n` is 3), making `n // 2 - 1` equal to 0 or more depending on the value of `n`.

Other variables remain unchanged, so the final state can be expressed as follows:

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 2, and `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`**.
