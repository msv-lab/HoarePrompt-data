The given code snippet `n //= 2` performs an integer division of `n` by 2, effectively halving the value of `n`. Based on the initial state and the operation performed:

- `h` remains an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive.
- `n` was previously stated to be at least 3, so after the operation, `n` becomes `n // 2`, which will be at least 1.
- `ans` remains unchanged for now, since there is no condition affecting it directly with the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `ans` remains unchanged.**
