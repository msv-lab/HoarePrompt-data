The function reads two integers, `h` and `n`, from user input, where `h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive and `n` is between 1 and \(2^h\) inclusive. It processes `n` in a loop, reducing it by half until `n` equals 1, during which it calculates a cumulative sum `ans` based on whether `n` is even or odd at each step. After the loop concludes, the function outputs the final value of `ans`, which represents the total contributions calculated from `n` during the iterations. The function does not return a value but prints `ans` directly. Note that it does not handle the case where `n` is 1, which means it anticipates that `n` will always be greater than 1 upon entering the loop.
