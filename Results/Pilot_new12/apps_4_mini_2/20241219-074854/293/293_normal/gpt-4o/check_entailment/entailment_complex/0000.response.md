The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of nodes visited before finding the exit in the maze-like structure described in the problem statement.

### Key Issues:

1. **Path Traversal Logic**:
   - The program constructs the path to the exit using `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)`, which correctly represents the binary path based on the index of the leaf node `n`. However, it only counts the number of commands corresponding to this path (which is equal to `h`). 

2. **Correct Counting of Visited Nodes**:
   - According to the problem description, Amr visits nodes based on the prescribed command string "LRLRLRL...". The way it is described implies that he follows alternating left and right commands sensibly depending on whether the node has already been visited or not. This program does not account for skipping commands and the implications of those rules, notably:
     - The need to skip commands if a node has already been visited.
     - The handling of returning to the parent node after two consecutive skipped commands.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The `visited_count` simply equals `h` at the end of the for loop, and this does not encapsulate the expected behavior based on the required algorithm. The output misses the complexity of moving back if necessary and incrementally counting all the visited nodes instead of just counting the levels traversed in reaching the leaf node.

### Conclusion:
Since the logic for counting the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit does not follow the requirements as laid out in the problem specification, the program does not meet these needs correctly.

Thus, the overall correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
