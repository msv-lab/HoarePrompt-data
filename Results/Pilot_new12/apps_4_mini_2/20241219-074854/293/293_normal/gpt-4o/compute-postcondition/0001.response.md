The variables `h` and `n` are both assigned values from `input`, which is processed by `map(int, ...)` to convert the split string input into integers. The previous constraints of `h` and `n` remain valid, but their specific values are now dependent on the provided input. 

Assuming valid input is received where `h` and `n` adhere to the constraints `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}`, we conclude that:

- `h` will now hold the first integer from the input.
- `n` will hold the second integer from the input.

Since we cannot know the specific values without input, we represent `h` and `n` generically as input integers.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50, `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^{h}, `input` is the method sys.stdin.read, and `h` and `n` are now assigned values from the input as integers.**
