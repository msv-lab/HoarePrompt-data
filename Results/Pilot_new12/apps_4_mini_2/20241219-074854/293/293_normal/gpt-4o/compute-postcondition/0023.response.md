Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 5; `path` remains unchanged; `current_level` is 1; if `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is either 9 (if it was 4) or 13 (if it was 6); otherwise, if `direction` is not '0', then `current_node` is either 10 or 14.***
