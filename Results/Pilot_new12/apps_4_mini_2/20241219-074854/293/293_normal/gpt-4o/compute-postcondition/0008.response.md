The `visited_count` variable is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` is 0, thus it becomes 1 after the code executes. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 1; `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1` zero-padded to length `h`; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 0**
