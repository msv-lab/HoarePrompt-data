The `current_level` variable is assigned the value of 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The states of the other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is equal to \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 0; `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1`, zero-padded to length `h`; `current_level` is 0.**
