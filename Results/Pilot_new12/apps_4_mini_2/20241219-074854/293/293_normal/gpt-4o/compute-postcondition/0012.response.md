The line of code updates `current_node` by assigning it the value of `2 * current_node + 2`. Given the initial state where `current_node` is 0, we can calculate the new value of `current_node`:

```
current_node = 2 * 0 + 2 = 2
```

The other variables (`h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`, `direction`) are not affected by this line of code and retain their initial state.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 1; `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1` zero-padded to length `h`; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 2; and `direction` is not equal to '0'.**
