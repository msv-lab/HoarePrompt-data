The value of `current_node` is updated through the expression `2 * current_node + 2`. The previous value of `current_node` can either be 4 or 6, resulting in the following calculations:

1. If `current_node` is 4, then:
   - `current_node = 2 * 4 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10`
   
2. If `current_node` is 6, then:
   - `current_node = 2 * 6 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14`

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects both possible scenarios for `current_node`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 5; `path` remains unchanged; `current_level` is 1; `current_node` is either 10 or 14.**
