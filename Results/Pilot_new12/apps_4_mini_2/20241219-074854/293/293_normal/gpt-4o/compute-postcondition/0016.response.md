The value of `current_node` is updated by the expression `2 * current_node + 1`. Given that the initial state mentions `current_node` is set to either 1 or 2 based on the value of `direction`, we need to clarify its value:

- If `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is set to 1. 
- If `direction` is not '0', then `current_node` is set to 2.

Assuming both scenarios, the values of `current_node` will either be updated to 3 (if it was originally 1) or 5 (if it was originally 2). The other variables remain unaffected.

Considering these two possibilities, we derive the two potential output states:
1. If `current_node` was initially 1, after the operation it becomes 3.
2. If `current_node` was initially 2, after the operation it becomes 5.

Thus, the output state will reflect these changes with the respective scenarios.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 3; `path` remains unchanged; `current_level` is 1; if `direction` is '0', `current_node` is 3; otherwise, `current_node` is 5.**
