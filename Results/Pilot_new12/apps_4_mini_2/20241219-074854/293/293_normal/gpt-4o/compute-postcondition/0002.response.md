The variable `total_leaves` is assigned the value \(2^h\). The value of `h` is still within the range from 1 to 50, therefore `total_leaves` will always be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to \(2^{50}\). The value of `n` remains unchanged, and it is still an integer in the range from 1 to \(2^h\). 

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is equal to \(2^h\).**
