The variable `current_node` is assigned the value `2 * current_node + 1`. The previous value of `current_node` is 0. Therefore, the new value becomes `2 * 0 + 1 = 1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 1; `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1` zero-padded to length `h`; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 1.**
