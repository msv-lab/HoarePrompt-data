The value of `current_node` is updated using the expression `2 * current_node + 2`. Initially, if `direction` is '0', `current_node` is set to 1; otherwise, `current_node` is set to 2. Since the specific value of `current_node` is not provided in the initial state, we will analyze both possibilities.

1. If `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is initially 1:
   - Calculating the new value: `current_node = 2 * 1 + 2 = 4`

2. If `direction` is not '0', then `current_node` is initially 2:
   - Calculating the new value: `current_node = 2 * 2 + 2 = 6`

Thus, the output state's information varies based on the value of `direction`. In either case, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 3; `path` remains unchanged; `current_level` is 1; if `direction` is '0', `current_node` is 4; otherwise, `current_node` is 6.**
