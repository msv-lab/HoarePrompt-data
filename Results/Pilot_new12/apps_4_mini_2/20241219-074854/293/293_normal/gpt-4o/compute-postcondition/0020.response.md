The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `visited_count` is 4, after execution, `visited_count` becomes 5. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 5; `path` remains unchanged; `current_level` is 1; `current_node` is either 4 or 6 depending on the next value of `direction`.
