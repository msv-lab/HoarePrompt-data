Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 1; `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1` zero-padded to length `h`; `current_level` is 0; if `direction` is '0', `current_node` is set to 1; otherwise, `current_node` is set to 2 and `direction` is not equal to '0'.***
