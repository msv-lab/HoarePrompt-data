The function `func_1` does not accept any direct parameters; instead, it relies on global variables or other means to use `h` and `n`. The constraints specify that `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}. Based on this information, we can infer the function's behavior regarding its output.

Since there is no output description provided in your request, we cannot determine specific return values or the cases based on the constraints given. Assuming typical behavior for similar functions, we might anticipate outcomes based on the values of `h` and `n`, but without precise details of the expected output, we cannot present specific cases.

Thus, the incomplete functionality can be described generically as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but relies on global variables or specific variables `h` and `n`, with `h` being an integer between 1 and 50, and `n` an integer between 1 and 2 raised to the power of `h`. The return value or specific behavior of the function is not specified.**
