The variable `visited_count` is assigned the value of `0`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Hence, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the updated value for `visited_count`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is equal to \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 0**.
