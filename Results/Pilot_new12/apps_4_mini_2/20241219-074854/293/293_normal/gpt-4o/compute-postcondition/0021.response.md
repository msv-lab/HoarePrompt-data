The statement `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` updates the value of `current_node`. The previous value of `current_node` could either be 4 or 6. 

If we assume `current_node` is 4:
- The new value of `current_node` would be `2 * 4 + 1 = 9`.

If we assume `current_node` is 6:
- The new value of `current_node` would be `2 * 6 + 1 = 13`.

However, unless informed otherwise, we have to represent both possibilities.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer in the range from 1 to 50; `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 2^h; `total_leaves` is equal to 2^h; `visited_count` is 5; `path` remains unchanged; `current_level` is 1; `current_node` is either 9 (if it was 4) or 13 (if it was 6).**
