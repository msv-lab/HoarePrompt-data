The function reads two integers, `h` and `n`, from the standard input, where `h` is constrained between 1 and 50 and `n` between 1 and 2 raised to the power of `h`. It calculates the total number of leaves in a binary tree represented by `h`. The function then constructs a binary path corresponding to `n-1` and traverses this path in the binary tree, incrementing a count of visited nodes. Finally, it prints the total number of visited nodes, which equals `h`, indicating how many levels were traversed in the process. The function does not return a value nor use explicit parameters but relies on standard input for its operation.
