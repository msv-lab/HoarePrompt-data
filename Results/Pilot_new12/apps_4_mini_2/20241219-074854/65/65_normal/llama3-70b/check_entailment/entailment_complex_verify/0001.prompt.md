You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if max_color_count <= k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of balloons exceeds the number of friends multiplied by the maximum number of different color distributions allowed.

Consider the edge case:
Input:
```
5 2
aabbb
```
In this case, there are 5 balloons and 2 friends. The color frequencies are:
- 'a': 2
- 'b': 3

Here, balloon color 'b' cannot be distributed without making one of the friends upset, because there are 3 balloons of color 'b' and only 2 friends to assign them to. This means at least one friend will inevitably get multiple balloons of the same color, leading to the output "NO".

However, the current program incorrectly calculates that since the maximum color count (3 for 'b') is greater than the number of friends (2), it will output "NO", which is correct. 

But now consider: 
Input:
```
4 2
abcd
```
In case there are 4 different colors, we can assign them to friends without any of them getting the same color. The program recognizes the maximum color occurrence is 1 (since each color appears only once), which is less than the number of friends, and returns "YES".

Another case:
Input:
```
3 3
aaa
```
In this case, Kefa has 3 friends, and he can choose to give no balloons to one friend while giving the same colored balloons to the other 2 friends without upsetting them.

So there are configurations that can lead to incorrect logic where their evaluations do not cover all unique or non-unique color situations properly for the constraints set by the number of friends. 

Thus, the answer for this implementation is "False" because it may not accurately handle edge cases where the balloon count vastly exceeds the ability of friends to distribute without causing upset friends.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of baloons, k is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the baloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, where the keys are the unique characters from `s` and the values are the counts of those characters.
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if (max_color_count <= k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `k` is a positive integer, and `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`. If the maximum frequency value `max_color_count` from `color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, if `max_color_count` is greater than `k`, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines if the maximum frequency of any color of balloons, represented by the string `s`, is less than or equal to the number of friends `k`. It accepts two integers (n and k) and a string (s) representing the colors of the balloons. After processing, if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to k, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, and it assumes valid input where n is the length of s, which should be non-empty and composed of lowercase letters. Edge cases, such as an empty input for `s` or characters not being lowercase letters, are not explicitly handled in the code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
