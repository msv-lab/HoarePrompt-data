You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if max_color_count <= k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly accounts for all scenarios described.

The problem states that Kefa has `n` balloons of different colors and `k` friends. Each friend should not receive two balloons of the same color. The program should output "YES" if it is possible to distribute the balloons without upsetting any friend, and "NO" otherwise. 

Let’s break down the program:

1. It counts the occurrences of each color of balloon using a dictionary.
2. It then checks the maximum count of any single color of balloon (`max_color_count`).
3. If this maximum count is less than or equal to the number of friends (`k`), it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Now, let’s consider some edge cases that could prove the program incorrect:

1. **Case with just one color exceeding friends:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     3 1
     aaa
     ```
   - Expected output: "NO" (since one friend cannot take more than one balloon of color 'a').
   - Actual output: "NO" (program works correctly here).

2. **Case with multiple colors and enough friends:**
   - Input:
     ```
     5 3
     abcde
     ```
   - Expected output: "YES" (each friend can take one balloon, no duplicates).
   - Actual output: "YES" (program works correctly here).

3. **Case with colors distributing evenly among friends:**
   - Input:
     ```
     6 2
     aabbcc
     ```
   - Expected output: "YES" (first friend can get two of any color).
   - Actual output: "YES" (program works correctly here).

4. **Case with `n = k`:**
   - Input:
     ```
     3 3
     abc
     ```
   - Expected output: "YES" (each friend can get one unique balloon).
   - Actual output: "YES" (program works correctly here).

5. **Case with more friends than required duplications**: 
   - Input:
     ```
     4 2
     aabb
     ```
   - Expected output: "YES" (since two friends can receive one of each color).
   - Actual output: "YES" (program works correctly here).

However, a counter-example demonstrating the failure of the program can be drawn considering the breakdown of colors:

- **A failing case depending on implementation logic**: 
   - Input:
     ```
     4 2
     aaaa
     ```
   - Expected output: "NO" (as all balloons are the same color but more than one friend).
   - The current logic: It will correctly identify "NO" as it sets `max_color_count` to 4, which exceeds the `k` value of 2.

After thorough checking for potential edge cases, it appears that the program behaves as expected in handling distribution rules laid out in the description based on test inputs considered from the lower limits to given constraints.

Correctness: **True**. The program properly handles scenarios where duplicate colors exceed the number of friends, handling the dictionary properly to gather counts and checking against `k` accordingly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of baloons, k is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the baloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, where the keys are the unique characters from `s` and the values are the counts of those characters.
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if (max_color_count <= k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `k` is a positive integer, and `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`. If the maximum frequency value `max_color_count` from `color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, if `max_color_count` is greater than `k`, the output is 'NO'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
