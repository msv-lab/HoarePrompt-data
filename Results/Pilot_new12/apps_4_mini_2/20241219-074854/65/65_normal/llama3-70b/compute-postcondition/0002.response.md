The variable `color_count` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The states of `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged variables along with the new initialization of `color_count`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string of length `n`, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `color_count` is an empty dictionary**.
