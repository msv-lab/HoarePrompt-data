Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `k` is a positive integer, and `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`. If the maximum frequency value `max_color_count` from `color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, if `max_color_count` is greater than `k`, the output is 'NO'.***
