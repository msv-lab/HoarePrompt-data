The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input after converting them to integers. The value of `s` remains unchanged. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of balloons, and `k` is also updated based on the input, represented as another positive integer. The values of `n` and `k` after this assignment are now determined by the user input but still remain positive integers. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the balloons, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer**
