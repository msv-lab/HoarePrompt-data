According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` (where `n` is at least 2), the loop will execute for the characters at indices 0 through n-1. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `c` is currently the second character of `s`. 

To execute one more time, the iteration needs to move to the next character in the string. The current character for `c` (the second character) suggests that when we increase the index, `c` will take the value of the third character in the string (if it exists). 

For the loop to execute again, there must still be characters left in the string `s`. Since the length of `s` is at least 2 after the last iteration, we know that when `c` updates to the third character, `s` must be at least 3 characters long.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: 

- Update `c` to be the third character of `s`.
- The string `s` must have a length of at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at least 3, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is the third character of `s`**
