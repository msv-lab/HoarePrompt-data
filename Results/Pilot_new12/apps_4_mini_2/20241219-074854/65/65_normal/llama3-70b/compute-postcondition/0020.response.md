The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console. The execution of this statement does not change any of the variables or their values in the current state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and indicates that a value has been printed.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `max_color_count` is the maximum frequency value from `color_count`, and 'YES' has been printed.**
