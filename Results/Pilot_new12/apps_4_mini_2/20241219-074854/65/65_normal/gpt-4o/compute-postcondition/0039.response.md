Functionality: **The function reads two integers, `n` (number of balloons) and `k` (number of friends), followed by a string `s` representing the colors of the balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color in `s` and checks if any color count exceeds `k`. If no color exceeds `k`, it prints 'YES', indicating that the balloons can be evenly distributed among friends. If any color exceeds `k`, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to distribute them fairly. The function does not return a value; instead, it directly prints the results. Edge cases to consider include cases where all colors are the same, ensuring that `k` is not zero, and ensuring `n` falls within the specified range.**
