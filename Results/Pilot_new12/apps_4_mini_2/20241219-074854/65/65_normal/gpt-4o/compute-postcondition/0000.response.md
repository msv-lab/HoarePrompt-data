The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input, where `input()` accepts a line of input and `map(int, input().split())` converts the split input values into integers. The variable `n` represents the number of balloons, and `k` represents the number of friends. The previous values of `n` and `k` were valid integers within the specified range, but their exact values are now determined by user input. The string `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of balloons as determined by input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is a positive integer representing the number of friends as determined by input (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons.**
