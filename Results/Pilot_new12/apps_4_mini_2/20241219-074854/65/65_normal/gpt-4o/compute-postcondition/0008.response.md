Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters, and `color` is the first character in `s`. If `color` is in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is increased by 1. If `color` is not in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is initialized to 1.***
