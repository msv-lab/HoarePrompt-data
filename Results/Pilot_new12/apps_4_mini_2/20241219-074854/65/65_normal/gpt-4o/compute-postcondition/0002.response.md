The code initializes an empty dictionary named `color_count`, which will be used to hold the count of different colors represented by the characters in the string `s`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and no values are modified because the dictionary is being created anew.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons, `color_count` is an empty dictionary {}**
