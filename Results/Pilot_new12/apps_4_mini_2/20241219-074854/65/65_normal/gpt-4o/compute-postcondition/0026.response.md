The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_count` is a dictionary with at least two entries; `count` is the value of the second entry in `color_count`; `if count ≤ k` is true; `can_distribute` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
