Correctness: **False** 

The program incorrectly checks if the maximum number of identical colored balloons is within the limit of `k` friends. The logic fails in cases where the total number of balloons `n` exceeds `k` multiplied by the number of distinct colors that can be distributed without exceeding the limit per friend.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 2
aabbcc
```
In this case, there are 6 balloons distributed among 2 friends, and they can get one balloon of each color. However, because each color can go to each friend only once, it should not be possible to evenly distribute all balloons without exceeding the limit for some colors, yet the program would print "YES".

Thus, there exist scenarios where the program does not work correctly based on the problem description. The program fails to account for the distribution limit relative to both the total number of balloons and the distinct colors, leading to an incorrect output in certain cases.
