You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program in the context of the given problem description, we need to understand the requirements thoroughly.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Kefa has `n` balloons of different colors, represented as a string `s`.
2. Kefa has `k` friends. 
3. Each friend can only receive one balloon of each color; receiving two balloons of the same color will upset them.
4. The program should determine whether it's possible to distribute all the `n` balloons to `k` friends without upsetting any friend.

### Code Analysis:

- The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, along with the string `s`, which represents the colors of the `n` balloons.
- It counts how many balloons there are of each color using a dictionary.
- The program checks if any color has more occurrences than `k`. If so, it sets `can_distribute` to `False` because one friend's limit has been exceeded.
- Finally, it prints "YES" if all balloons can be distributed without upsetting any friend; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Single Balloon with One Friend:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     1 1
     a
     ```
   - Output: "YES" (Correct)

2. **More Balloons than Friends with Unique Colors:**
   - Input:
     ```
     3 2
     abc
     ```
   - Output: "YES" (Correct)

3. **More Balloons of a Single Color than Friends:**
   - Input:
     ```
     5 1
     aaaaa
     ```
   - Output: "NO" (Correct)

4. **Exactly the Same Number of Balloons and Friends but One Color:**
   - Input:
     ```
     3 3
     aaabbb
     ```
   - Output: "YES" (Correct)

5. **More Balloons of Different Colors than Friends:**
   - Input:
     ```
     7 2
     aabbccdd
     ```
   - Output: "NO" (Correct; each color is repeated and friends can't take more than 2)

### Testing for Other Edge Cases

6. **More Friends than Balloons, All Unique Colors:**
   - Input:
     ```
     4 6
     abcd
     ```
   - Output: "YES" (Correct; the excess friends would not receive balloons)

7. **More Balloons than Friends of One Color:**
   - Input:
     ```
     8 4
     aaaabbbb
     ```
   - Output: "NO" (Correct; more than 4 of color 'a' cannot satisfy the distribution)

### Conclusion Based on Analysis

After running through the above scenarios, the code correctly implements the described logic and handles edge cases effectively. I could not find an input case where it fails to comply with the problem description. Therefore, the logic appears satisfactory in all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of baloons (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), k is a positive integer representing the number of friends (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the baloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `color_count` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `s` to the number of occurrences of that character, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase letters, and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `color_count` is a dictionary containing the counts of each character in `s`, `can_distribute` is False if any count exceeds `k`, otherwise `can_distribute` is True.
    if can_distribute :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`color_count` is a dictionary containing the counts of each character in `s`. If `can_distribute` is True, it indicates that no count in `color_count` exceeds `k`, and 'YES' has been printed. If `can_distribute` is False, it indicates that at least one count in `color_count` exceeds `k`, and 'NO' has been printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
