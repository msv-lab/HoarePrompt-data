You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function and see if it meets all the requirements specified.

The program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each color in the balloon string and checks if any color appears more times than the number of friends \( k \). If a color appears more than \( k \) times, it concludes that it's impossible to distribute these balloons without upsetting a friend.

Now let's consider a few potential cases:

1. **All unique colors**: If all balloons are of different colors and \( k \) is less than \( n \), the program should return "YES". For instance:
   - Input: `3 2` with balloon colors `abc` should correctly output "YES".

2. **More colors than friends**: If one color appears more than \( k \) times, regardless of other colors, the output should be "NO". For instance:
   - Input: `5 2` with balloon colors `aaabb` should output "NO". The program handles this correctly by checking if any color count exceeds \( k \).

3. **Edge cases with minimum inputs**:
   - Input: `1 1` with balloon color `a` should output "YES" since there’s only one balloon and one friend.

4. **Edge case with maximum input constraints**:
   - Input: `100 50` with balloon colors that alternate between two colors (like `abab...` for a total of 100 characters), should output "NO" as both colors will have 50 counts each, which means each friend's count will match, and one left over would upset a friend.

The only potential issue arises when checking if handling the case where a color count is exactly equal to \( k \). The current logic does not account correctly for scenarios in which multiple balloons of the same color equal \( k \) should be correctly distributed among the friends.

Thus, while the program covers common cases and edge cases generally, it doesn’t fully encapsulate scenarios where the total balloons get distributed when counts reach \( k \) specifically. 

Given this analysis, I conclude that there could be cases where the program might behave incorrectly, leading to:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers, `n` (number of balloons) and `k` (number of friends), followed by a string `s` representing the colors of the balloons. It counts the occurrences of each color in `s` and checks if any color count exceeds `k`. If no color exceeds `k`, it prints 'YES', indicating that the balloons can be evenly distributed among friends. If any color exceeds `k`, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to distribute them fairly. The function does not return a value; instead, it directly prints the results. Edge cases to consider include cases where all colors are the same, ensuring that `k` is not zero, and ensuring `n` falls within the specified range.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
