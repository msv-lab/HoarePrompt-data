The variables `x` and `y` are reassigned the values obtained from `input`, which will be processed by the `map(int, ...)` function to convert the input values into integers. Since the constraints state that `y` is less than `x` and both are integers within certain bounds, the new values will overwrite the initial ones while still satisfying the condition `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. 

Other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values assigned to `x` and `y`, along with the valid condition that still holds. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer resulting from user input, `y` is an integer resulting from user input, such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000.**
