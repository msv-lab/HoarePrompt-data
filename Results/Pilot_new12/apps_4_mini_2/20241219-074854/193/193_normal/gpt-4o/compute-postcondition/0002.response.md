The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with the constraint that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not return any output based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `x` and `y`, adhering to the specified constraints. It does not provide a return value as per the given details. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, both integers, with constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but does not return any output.**
