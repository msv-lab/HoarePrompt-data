The code calculates and prints the result of the expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\). The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, but the expression computes a value based on their difference.

Given the constraints that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), the value \(x - y\) is guaranteed to be a positive integer. Let's denote \(d = x - y\), which is positive.

The expression simplifies further:
- \((x - y) // 2\) computes the integer division of \(d\) by 2.
- \((x - y) \% 2\) computes the remainder of \(d\) when divided by 2, which will be 0 if \(d\) is even and 1 if \(d\) is odd.

These calculations will generate a specific integer result, which is returned by the print statement.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` were not provided, we keep them in their constraints while noting that there's an output based on the calculated result.

Output State: **`x` is an integer resulting from user input, `y` is an integer resulting from user input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output is the integer value of \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\)**.
