Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate as it points out the key flaw in the program's logic concerning the maintenance of a non-degenerate triangle. The program's formula, which simplifies to `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, fails to account for cases where simply decrementing sides might lead to configurations that no longer satisfy the triangle inequality, specifically when reducing one side while keeping others longer. 

The annotations confirm that the input constraints (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000) ensure that `x` and `y` will always be valid integers, but this validation alone does not resolve the potential issue of forming a valid triangulated structure throughout the modification process, especially in crucial edge cases (like x=4, y=3). Thus, the concern that the program can lead to incorrect assumptions in certain configurations directly supports the conclusion that the program ultimately cannot guarantee correctness across its entire input domain.
