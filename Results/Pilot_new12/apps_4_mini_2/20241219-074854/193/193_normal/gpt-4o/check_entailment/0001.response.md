Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly account for all scenarios described in the problem. The formula used, `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, calculates the number of operations as half of the difference plus one if the difference is odd. However, this formula does not accurately reflect the requirement to maintain a valid non-degenerate triangle during the operations.

For instance, consider the input case `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The difference is `6 - 3 = 3`, and the expected moves to reach `(3,3,3)` would be:
1. (6, 6, 6) -> (6, 6, 3)
2. (6, 6, 3) -> (6, 4, 3)
3. (6, 4, 3) -> (3, 4, 3)
4. (3, 4, 3) -> (3, 3, 3)

In total, it takes 4 seconds, whereas the program would compute `3`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to handle the requirement of maintaining the triangle's validity during the entire transformation process.
