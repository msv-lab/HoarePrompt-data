To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the function and how it processes the input.

The function calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to modify an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to `y`. The given formula in the code, 

```python
(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2
```

is intended to provide the number of moves required to reduce each of the triangle's sides from `x` to `y`. 

### Breakdown of the Formula:
1. `(x - y) // 2`: This calculates how many full moves of 2 units can be made to reduce the side from `x` to `y`.
2. `(x - y) % 2`: This checks if there's an additional 1 unit reduction needed (i.e., if the difference between `x` and `y` is odd).

### Validity Check against Problem Description:
- **Starting Point:** The starting triangle has sides of length `x` (the maximum side length).
- **Ending Point:** The aim is to reduce the sides to length `y` such that the triangle remains non-degenerate.

### Validation of Cases:
Considering edge cases, the function does work correctly for the following scenarios:
- For the difference `(x - y)`, if even, the formula directly computes half the difference.
- If odd, it accounts for the additional second needed.

The program processes input constrained by `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`, implying further constraints are safely managed without the code needing to handle invalid inputs explicitly due to the given rules.

### Example Validations:
1. **Input:** `6 3` 
   - Actual Moves: (6,6,6) -> (6,6,3) -> (6,4,3) -> (3,4,3) -> (3,3,3) = 4 moves
   - Calculated: `((6-3) // 2) + ((6-3) % 2) = (3 // 2) + (3 % 2) = 1 + 1 = 2` — Actually this is incorrect because it simplifies down without proper consideration of non-degenerate triangle aspect.
   
2. **Input:** `8 5`
   - Moves: (8,8,8) -> (8,8,5) -> (8,5,5) -> (5,5,5) — 3 moves
   - Again calculated incorrectly from the program logic leads to confusion.
  
### Conclusion:
The program miscalculates moves as it does not properly account for the exact finite-step evolution toward maintaining triangle integrity and may omit necessary steps leading to negative or inappropriate states during transformations.

Thus, there are instances where the program does not yield valid outputs based on both problem constraints and examples provided.

Correctness: **False**
