You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break it down.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of seconds required to modify the sides of an initial equilateral triangle with side length `x` into a triangle with side length `y`. The steps must maintain the property that the sides form a non-degenerate triangle (i.e., positive area) throughout the process. 

The program calculates the number of seconds needed using the formula:
```python
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```
This can be broken down as follows:
1. `(x - y) // 2` computes how many full side-length decreases of `2` can be performed, effectively counting how many full second operations can be done when decrementing two sides at once.
2. `(x - y) % 2` checks if there is an odd adjustment needed, which requires an additional operation to decrement one side by `1`.

However, we must consider a critical aspect related to maintaining the non-degenerate property of the triangle. 

For example, with starting sides of length `x = 5` and target sides of `y = 3`:
- Initial triangle: `(5, 5, 5)`
- A valid path could be: 
   1. `(5, 5, 5)` to `(5, 5, 3)` (1 second)
   2. `(5, 5, 3)` to `(3, 5, 3)` (1 second)
   3. `(3, 5, 3)` to `(3, 3, 3)` (1 second)

So, we took a total of 3 seconds, matching the target. 

However, let's examine the case when `x` is just one more than `y`, for example:
- For `x = 4` and `y = 3`:
   - The output of the program would be `((4 - 3) // 2 + (4 - 3) % 2)`, which gives `0 + 1 = 1` second.
   - Possible steps could be: 
     1. `(4, 4, 4)` → `(4, 4, 3)` 
     2. After this, it's not possible to decrement the sides further without violating the non-degenerate triangle condition. A triangle of sides `(3, 4, 3)` is not valid.

Since the program does not consider carefully the conditions required to maintain a non-degenerate triangle, it could produce incorrect results for certain values of `x` and `y`, especially for edge cases.

Thus, we conclude:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to accurately calculate the number of operations needed while maintaining the structure of a non-degenerate triangle in all cases. For example, for inputs `4 3`, it produces incorrect results; it neglects that a triangle cannot have two sides equal to `3` and one side greater than `3` in the steps suggested.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, x and y, provided via user input, with the condition that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. It calculates the result of the expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\) and prints this result to the console. However, the function does not return any values or handle invalid input cases where x and y do not meet the specified constraints. The output represents half the difference between x and y, rounded up if the difference is odd, indicating a specific computation based on the input values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
