The program provided attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of operations required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y`. 

Let's analyze the statement and the logic of the code:

1. **Problem Statement**: You are asked to determine the minimum number of seconds required to change the side length from `x` to `y` with the constraints that the triangle must remain non-degenerate throughout the process.

2. **Input Constraints**: The function takes two integers, `x` and `y`, ensuring that they satisfy `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. This constraint is appropriately stated in the problem description as well as in the comments of the code.

3. **Output**: The output of the function is calculated using:
   \[
   (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2
   \]
   This expression correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to change the triangle from side length `x` to `y`. Specifically, it computes how many times we need to reduce the side length, accounting for whether the difference `x - y` is even or odd. 

   - If `x - y` is even, the number of operations equals \((x - y) / 2\).
   - If `x - y` is odd, the calculation \((x - y) // 2 + 1\) is expressed more simply as \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\) which adds one additional operation.

4. **Correctness of Logic**: 
   - Since every step reduces the side lengths from `x` to reach `y`, the proposed formula effectively encapsulates the minimum operations necessary while ensuring each side length remains a non-degenerate triangle (i.e., each side length always remains positive).
   - Given the constraints that `y` is always less than `x`, and both `x` and `y` start from a minimum value of 3, it guarantees that the lengths can always be adjusted without falling into an invalid triangle configuration.

Therefore, after reviewing both the problem description and the program logic, it is clear that the program adheres to the requirements set forth in the description.

Correctness: **True**
