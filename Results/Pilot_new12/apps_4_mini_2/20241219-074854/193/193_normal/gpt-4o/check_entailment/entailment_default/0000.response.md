The code provided calculates the number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle with side length \( x \) into one with side length \( y \). It does this using the formula \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\), which effectively calculates the number of modifications required to reduce each side of the triangle evenly until they reach the desired length.

Let's analyze this:

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to transform a triangle of side length \( x \) into one of side length \( y \) with the rule that at no point can the triangle degenerate into a non-degenerate one. An equilateral triangle remains non-degenerate as long as all sides are positive.

2. **Calculation Explanation**:
   - The difference \( (x - y) \) gives the total length difference that needs to be adjusted.
   - Dividing this by 2 gives the number of full reductions that can be made across two sides simultaneously. The modulo operation accounts for cases where the reduction cannot evenly be made (if the difference is odd, we will need an extra move).

3. **Output Hints**: The hints explain that the function calculates the required seconds based on the difference between side lengths and do not mention handling cases that fall outside the specified bounds. Given that \( x \) and \( y \) must always satisfy \( 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 \), it appears that valid inputs are always adhered to in the function.

4. **Edge Cases**: The only potential edge cases (at the edges of input values) are already handled by the constraints. For example, when \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 3 \), the calculation will correctly yield 1 (since \( (4 - 3) // 2 + (4 - 3) \% 2 = 0 + 1 = 1\)). Since \( 3 ≤ y < x \), the function will never encounter any illogical situations that would produce an invalid triangle configuration.

Since the function behaves correctly for all specified conditions and yields accurate results according to the problem description, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
