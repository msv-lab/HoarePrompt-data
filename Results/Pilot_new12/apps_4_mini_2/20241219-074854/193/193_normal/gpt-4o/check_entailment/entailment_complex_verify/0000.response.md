Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate as it highlights the shortcomings of the program. The program, while functioning correctly under some circumstances, fails to consistently maintain the non-degenerate triangle condition as outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` does not take into account the requirement that the triangle must remain valid (non-degenerate) throughout the operations. 

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program computes an output based solely on the difference between `x` and `y`, without considering the implications of those modifications on a triangle's validity. As a result, for cases where `x` and `y` are very close (such as 4 and 3), the program could output a value that leads to operations which would result in an invalid triangle.

Thus, the conclusion that the program does not meet the requirements satisfactorily holds true, leading to a final assessment of **False**.
