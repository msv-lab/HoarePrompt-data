The provided program computes the absolute difference between the two lengths \( x \) and \( y \) (start and target side lengths of an equilateral triangle). However, this approach does not align with the problem description, which explicitly states that the operations must ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate and reduces each side appropriately to match the target equilateral triangle of side length \( y \).

The operations that Memory can perform are not simply based on the absolute difference between \( x \) and \( y \). Instead, he must ensure that after each operation, the triangle remains valid and retains the properties of a triangle (meaning the lengths must satisfy the triangle inequality). For instance, when reducing side lengths one by one, he cannot just reduce one side to \( y \) without also managing the other two sides accordingly, which means multiple adjustments may be required, and the sequence of operations is important.

For example, consider \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \):
- The correct sequence based on the problem statement requires moving from \( (6, 6, 6) \) down to \( (3, 3, 3) \), taking each step carefully to always keep the triangle valid.
- The program incorrectly concludes that 3 operations are needed simply because it computes \( |6 - 3| \).

This discrepancy indicates that the program fails to meet the problem requirement in multiple cases, resulting in incorrect outputs for the sequences of operations required to arrive at \( y \).

Correctness: **False**.
