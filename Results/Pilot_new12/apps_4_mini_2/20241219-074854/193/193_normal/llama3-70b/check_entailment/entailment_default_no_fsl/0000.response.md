Correctness: **False**

The provided program only calculates the absolute difference between the two side lengths (x and y) and outputs that value. However, according to the problem description, obtaining the target triangle requires more than just calculating the difference between x and y. The program assumes that the minimum number of operations is equal to the difference in lengths, which is incorrect. 

For example, consider the inputs `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The correct sequence of operations is (6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3), which takes a total of 4 seconds, not 3 (the absolute difference).

Therefore, the program does not adequately account for the necessary operations to transition from one equilateral triangle side length to another while ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate, thus leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
