The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input received from `map(int, input().split())`. The constraints state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`, but do not specify exact initial values for `x` and `y`. They both get replaced by the values provided as input, which must satisfy the given constraints. Therefore, the updated values of `x` and `y` are now specific integers provided via the input from the user, while maintaining the conditions that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`. 

Output State: **`x` is a specific integer, `y` is a specific integer, with the condition that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100000 still valid.**
