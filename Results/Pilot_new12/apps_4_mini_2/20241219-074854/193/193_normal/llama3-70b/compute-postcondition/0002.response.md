The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000. After executing the function, the specific output is not directly provided, but we know it operates under the stated constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `x` and `y` within the specified range constraints without specifying its return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, both integers, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000.**
