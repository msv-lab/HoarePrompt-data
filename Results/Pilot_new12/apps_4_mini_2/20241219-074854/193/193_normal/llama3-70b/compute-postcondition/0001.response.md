The `print` function outputs the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the condition that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100000\), it directly follows that the value of \(x - y\) is positive, hence the output of `abs(x - y)` will simply be \(x - y\).

The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged in this operation, and the state does not introduce any new variables. The impact is solely in the expression being printed which evaluates to a specific non-negative integer.

Output State: **`x` is a specific integer, `y` is a specific integer, 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100000; the output printed is equal to `x - y`.**
