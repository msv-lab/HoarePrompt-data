To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step and consider potential edge cases that could arise.

The problem requires calculating the maximum points Polycarp can earn given:
- `n` tasks, each consisting of `k` subtasks.
- Each subtask takes a specific amount of time to solve, detailed in the list `t`.
- An additional point is awarded for completing all subtasks of a task.

The implemented function `func_1(n, k, M, t)` does the following:
1. Calculates the total time required to complete all subtasks for a task.
2. Iterates through the possible number of complete tasks Polycarp can finish within the time `M`.
3. For each complete task, it calculates the time used and points earned, then checks how many additional subtasks can be solved with the remaining time.
4. It accounts for the maximum number of subtasks that can be attempted based on time constraints and limits the subtasks solved to the possible remaining tasks.

### Potential Problems

1. **Max Points Calculation Issue**:
   - The logic for calculating `subtasks_solved` takes the total remaining time for subtasks and does not correctly account for the fact that once all `n` tasks have been considered, not every complete task can equate to earning the same number of subtasks afterward.

2. **No Account for Zero Time**:
   - If `M = 0`, the code should handle this case and return `0` immediately without attempting any further calculations.

3. **Performance**:
   - The use of multiple loops may become inefficient for the upper limits of `M` (e.g. `2*10^9`), but thatâ€™s more about efficiency than correctness.

#### Testing Specific Cases

Identifying cases where the program might not behave as expected:

- **Case 1**: With `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `M = 0`, `t = [1]`
   - Expected output is `0` since no tasks can be completed.
   - The program would compute `complete_tasks = 0`, meaning no full tasks are completed and check how many subtasks can be taken with `M = 0`, which it should return as `0` if it correctly handles early exits.

- **Case 2**: Complex distribution
   - Consider `n = 3, k = 3, M = 10`, and subtasks of times `[1, 1, 1]`, this should result in `10` points since Polycarp can fully complete three tasks and earn 4 extra points. But if the program wrongly calculates the remaining time, it may yield points incorrectly.

### Final Evaluation

After assessing specific potential edge cases, I find that the potential logic flaw can lead to the program not always returning the correct score across varying inputs.

Therefore, considering these issues and the inconsistency in how various edge cases are handled, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program may not correctly account for all situations described in the problem, particularly with how subtasks are calculated and how zero time is handled. A specific case where the incorrect handling of `M` leads to inaccuracies has been identified.
