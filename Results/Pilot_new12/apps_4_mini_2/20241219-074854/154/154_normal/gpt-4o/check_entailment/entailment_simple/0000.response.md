Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program starts by correctly reading the input values, including the number of tasks `n`, the number of subtasks `k`, the available time `M`, and the times required for each subtask.

2. **Total Time Calculation**: It computes the total time needed to solve all subtasks of a task by summing up the list `t`, which corresponds to the time for each subtask. This is essential for determining how many tasks can be fully completed within the available time.

3. **Loop Through Complete Tasks**: The program iterates through the number of complete tasks that Polycarp can solve (from 0 up to `n`). For each possible number of complete tasks, it calculates:
   - The `time_used` for fully completing those tasks.
   - If `time_used` exceeds `M`, it breaks out of the loop as further checks would not be valid.

4. **Points Calculation**: For every complete task, it correctly calculates the points earned, which is the product of `complete_tasks` and `(k + 1)`.

5. **Remaining Time and Subtasks Solved**: The program then uses the remaining time after completing the fully solved tasks to attempt solving additional subtasks of the remaining tasks. It iterates through the times required for each subtask, calculating how many additional subtasks can be solved with the remaining time. 

6. **Points Update Logic**: The program updates the maximum points using the simplest method of keeping track of the best score between completed tasks and additional subtasks.

7. **Final Return Value**: The total points computed via the logic perfectly reflects the scoring system outlined in the problem statement, ensuring that it can handle various combinations of completed tasks and additional subtasks.

Overall, the implementation is comprehensive, correctly adheres to the problem description, and efficiently calculates the maximum score based on defined conditions. There are no edge cases or errors in the logic observed that would break the requirements stated in the problem description. Thus, the program is indeed correct.
