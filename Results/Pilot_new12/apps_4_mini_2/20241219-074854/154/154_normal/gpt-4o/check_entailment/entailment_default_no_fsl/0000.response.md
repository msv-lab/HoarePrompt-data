Correctness: **True**

The provided program adheres to the problem description and successfully computes the maximum points Polycarp can earn given the constraints. The function `func_1` correctly considers all possible scenarios for completing full tasks and solving additional subtasks within the available time `M`.

Here's a breakdown of how the code meets the requirements:

1. **Complete Tasks Calculation**: The program iterates over the number of possible complete tasks Polycarp can solve (`complete_tasks`), from 0 up to `n`. For each potential number of complete tasks, it calculates the total time taken and checks if it exceeds `M`. 

2. **Subtasks Calculation**: For each completed task scenario, it calculates the remaining time and determines how many additional subtasks can be solved with that remaining time. It correctly accumulates the points for the solved subtasks and also ensures not to exceed the total possible subtasks available.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The function effectively handles edge cases:
   - When `M` is very small (e.g., `M = 0`), it would calculate to zero points, which is correct.
   - It handles the maximum constraints on `n` and `k` well within the given problem scope, ensuring the loops do not push beyond valid bounds.

4. **Correctness Against Provided Examples**: The output hints confirm that the logic handles the scenarios presented in the examples correctly by accurately calculating the points based on tasks completed and subtasks solved.

Since there are no identified edge cases where the program fails to adhere to the requirements, and it can handle all provided scenarios correctly, the conclusion is that the program's logic is sound and complete.

Thus, the correct output is confirmed: 
Correctness: **True**.
