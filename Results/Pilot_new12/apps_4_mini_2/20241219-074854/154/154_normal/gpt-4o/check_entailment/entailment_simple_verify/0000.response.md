Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program performs as intended based on the problem description. The program calculates the maximum points Polycarp can earn by iterating over potential complete tasks, accurately computing the total time spent and remaining time for subtasks. The annotations further confirm that the program maintains the necessary constraints and handles edge cases appropriately, such as insufficient time and various task configurations. The logic within `func_1` effectively ensures that points are maximized within the given time limit, validating the correctness of the program's output.
