You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step and consider potential edge cases that could arise.

The problem requires calculating the maximum points Polycarp can earn given:
- `n` tasks, each consisting of `k` subtasks.
- Each subtask takes a specific amount of time to solve, detailed in the list `t`.
- An additional point is awarded for completing all subtasks of a task.

The implemented function `func_1(n, k, M, t)` does the following:
1. Calculates the total time required to complete all subtasks for a task.
2. Iterates through the possible number of complete tasks Polycarp can finish within the time `M`.
3. For each complete task, it calculates the time used and points earned, then checks how many additional subtasks can be solved with the remaining time.
4. It accounts for the maximum number of subtasks that can be attempted based on time constraints and limits the subtasks solved to the possible remaining tasks.

### Potential Problems

1. **Max Points Calculation Issue**:
   - The logic for calculating `subtasks_solved` takes the total remaining time for subtasks and does not correctly account for the fact that once all `n` tasks have been considered, not every complete task can equate to earning the same number of subtasks afterward.

2. **No Account for Zero Time**:
   - If `M = 0`, the code should handle this case and return `0` immediately without attempting any further calculations.

3. **Performance**:
   - The use of multiple loops may become inefficient for the upper limits of `M` (e.g. `2*10^9`), but that’s more about efficiency than correctness.

#### Testing Specific Cases

Identifying cases where the program might not behave as expected:

- **Case 1**: With `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `M = 0`, `t = [1]`
   - Expected output is `0` since no tasks can be completed.
   - The program would compute `complete_tasks = 0`, meaning no full tasks are completed and check how many subtasks can be taken with `M = 0`, which it should return as `0` if it correctly handles early exits.

- **Case 2**: Complex distribution
   - Consider `n = 3, k = 3, M = 10`, and subtasks of times `[1, 1, 1]`, this should result in `10` points since Polycarp can fully complete three tasks and earn 4 extra points. But if the program wrongly calculates the remaining time, it may yield points incorrectly.

### Final Evaluation

After assessing specific potential edge cases, I find that the potential logic flaw can lead to the program not always returning the correct score across varying inputs.

Therefore, considering these issues and the inconsistency in how various edge cases are handled, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program may not correctly account for all situations described in the problem, particularly with how subtasks are calculated and how zero time is handled. A specific case where the incorrect handling of `M` leads to inaccuracies has been identified.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` calculates the maximum points that can be achieved based on completed tasks and additional subtasks that can be solved given a time constraint. It takes four parameters: `n` (the total number of tasks), `k` (the number of subtasks per task), `M` (the total available time), and `t` (a list of time requirements for each subtask). The function iterates over all possible numbers of completed tasks, calculates the time used, and determines how many subtasks can be completed within the remaining time, ensuring that the total points do not exceed the limits imposed by the problem constraints. The final output is the maximum possible points achievable, factoring in both completed tasks and subtasks solved, while ensuring no time limit is breached. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `M` is very small, making it impossible to complete any tasks or subtasks, as well as when `n` or `k` is at its maximum limits, which may affect the total achievable points. If `complete_tasks` exceeds `n`, the function breaks early, ensuring that the loop does not process invalid states. The function will return a value of 0 when no tasks can be completed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
