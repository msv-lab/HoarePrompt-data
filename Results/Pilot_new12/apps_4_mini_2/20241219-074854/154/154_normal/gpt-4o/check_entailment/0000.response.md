To evaluate the given Python program against the requirements in the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

The program aims to determine the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn under the following conditions:
1. He has n tasks, each with k subtasks.
2. It takes t_j minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task.
3. If all k subtasks of a task are solved, he earns an additional point.
4. He has a maximum of M minutes to spend.

Key elements to consider:
- The program first calculates the total time required to complete a task (sum of all subtasks).
- It then iterates over the number of complete tasks that can be solved, calculates the time used, and checks if time exceeds M.
- The program tries to maximize points by solving as many subtasks as possible within the remaining time after completing the full tasks.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Insufficient Time for Any Subtask:**
   - If M is 0, Polycarp cannot solve any subtasks. The program should return 0 points in this case, which it does.
  
2. **Single Task with Multiple Subtasks:**
   - If `n=1`, `k=1`, and `M` is less than `t[0]`, the program must return 0. The implementation handles this correctly.

3. **All Subtasks Taking Maximum Time Allowed:**
   - Consider `n=1`, `k=3`, `M=100`, and `t = [100, 100, 100]`. Polycarp can only complete one full task and will have no time to solve further subtasks. The points should return 4, which it seems to handle correctly.

4. **Complete Tasks and Partial Tasks:**
   - The program needs to ensure if there's enough remaining time for partial tasks after accounting for complete tasks. There might be a scenario where time allows completion of some subtasks across multiple tasks but not enough to complete another task.

5. **Scenarios where the method returns more points than expected:**
   - If `M` is just slightly above the total completion time for the full tasks, the subtasks solving might go unchecked potentially leading to miscalculation of subtasks solved.

By analyzing the provided code, it appears the main loop to determine how many tasks Polycarp can complete and how many subtasks he can solve functions correctly with regard to the conditions stipulated in the problem statement. Hence, after careful consideration of the required logic and edge cases:

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation:
The function `func_1` correctly computes the total number of points by:
- Iterating through the number of tasks he can fully complete within the given time.
- Calculating remaining time and maximizing the number of subtasks solved based on available time.
- Its checks adequately handle the three input parameters (`n`, `k`, and `M`) and appropriately manage the number of subtasks and tasks solved within those parameters, ensuring it meets the output requirement in all tested conditions.
