You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the given Python program against the requirements in the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

The program aims to determine the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn under the following conditions:
1. He has n tasks, each with k subtasks.
2. It takes t_j minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task.
3. If all k subtasks of a task are solved, he earns an additional point.
4. He has a maximum of M minutes to spend.

Key elements to consider:
- The program first calculates the total time required to complete a task (sum of all subtasks).
- It then iterates over the number of complete tasks that can be solved, calculates the time used, and checks if time exceeds M.
- The program tries to maximize points by solving as many subtasks as possible within the remaining time after completing the full tasks.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Insufficient Time for Any Subtask:**
   - If M is 0, Polycarp cannot solve any subtasks. The program should return 0 points in this case, which it does.
  
2. **Single Task with Multiple Subtasks:**
   - If `n=1`, `k=1`, and `M` is less than `t[0]`, the program must return 0. The implementation handles this correctly.

3. **All Subtasks Taking Maximum Time Allowed:**
   - Consider `n=1`, `k=3`, `M=100`, and `t = [100, 100, 100]`. Polycarp can only complete one full task and will have no time to solve further subtasks. The points should return 4, which it seems to handle correctly.

4. **Complete Tasks and Partial Tasks:**
   - The program needs to ensure if there's enough remaining time for partial tasks after accounting for complete tasks. There might be a scenario where time allows completion of some subtasks across multiple tasks but not enough to complete another task.

5. **Scenarios where the method returns more points than expected:**
   - If `M` is just slightly above the total completion time for the full tasks, the subtasks solving might go unchecked potentially leading to miscalculation of subtasks solved.

By analyzing the provided code, it appears the main loop to determine how many tasks Polycarp can complete and how many subtasks he can solve functions correctly with regard to the conditions stipulated in the problem statement. Hence, after careful consideration of the required logic and edge cases:

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation:
The function `func_1` correctly computes the total number of points by:
- Iterating through the number of tasks he can fully complete within the given time.
- Calculating remaining time and maximizing the number of subtasks solved based on available time.
- Its checks adequately handle the three input parameters (`n`, `k`, and `M`) and appropriately manage the number of subtasks and tasks solved within those parameters, ensuring it meets the output requirement in all tested conditions.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 45 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and 45 (inclusive), M is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9, and t is a list of k integers where each integer t[j] is between 1 and 1,000,000 (inclusive).
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        
        if time_used > M:
            break
        
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        
        remaining_time = M - time_used

                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 45; `complete_tasks` is between 0 and `n`; `k` is an integer between 1 and 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` is between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is the maximum points achievable based on the number of completed tasks and the subtasks solved, which cannot exceed `(n * k) + (n - complete_tasks) * k`; `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`; `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`; `subtasks_solved` is updated to the minimum of the previous `subtasks_solved` over each iteration and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`; `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used` and will be non-negative if the loop terminates without exceeding `M`.
    return max_points
    #The program returns the maximum points achievable based on the number of completed tasks and the subtasks solved, which cannot exceed `(n * k) + (n - complete_tasks) * k`.
