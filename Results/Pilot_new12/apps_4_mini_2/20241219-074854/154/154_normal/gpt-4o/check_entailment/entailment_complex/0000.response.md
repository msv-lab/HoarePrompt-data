To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its implementation against the problem description.

### Analysis of the Problem Description:
1. **Inputs**: We have `n` tasks, each containing `k` subtasks. Each subtask takes a specific `t[j]` minutes to complete.
2. **Scoring**:
   - For each completed subtask, Polycarp earns 1 point.
   - If he completely solves a task (all `k` subtasks), he receives an additional bonus point (totaling to `k + 1` points for a completed task).
3. **Time Constraint**: Polycarp has a total of `M` minutes to maximize his points.

### Breakdown of Program Logic:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly captures the input and initializes required variables: `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, and sets up a loop to check different counts of complete tasks that can be solved.
  
2. **Loop over Complete Tasks**: 
   - It begins iterating through all possible counts of complete tasks from 0 to `n`:
     - It calculates the total time used for completing a specific number of tasks.
     - It checks if that time exceeds `M` and breaks out if it does.
     - It calculates points earned from the completed tasks.
     - It calculates how many remaining subtasks can be completed given the remaining time, iterating through each subtask time.

3. **Subtask Calculation**:
   - It counts how many subtasks can be completed with the remaining time, taking care not to exceed the capacity defined by the remaining tasks left to solve. It respects the constraint ensuring it does not exceed the number of possible remaining tasks to calculate potential points correctly.

4. **Returning the Maximum Points**:
   - The algorithm maximizes points across different possible combinations of complete tasks and solved subtasks.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- If `M` is zero, the program should return 0 as no tasks can be completed, which aligns with the requirements.
- If all task times `t[j]` are greater than `M`, the program should subsequently yield maximum points consistent with the constraints imposed.

### Conclusion:
The logic flows according to the problem description, evaluating every possible scenario relating to the limits on time and number of tasks and subtasks to solve. The program appropriately computes the maximum points without breaching any conditions or constraints specified in the problem description.

Thus, the program is correct based on its definitions and how it adheres to the problem specification.

Correctness: **True**
