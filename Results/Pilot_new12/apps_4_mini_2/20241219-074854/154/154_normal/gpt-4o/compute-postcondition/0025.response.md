Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 0; `k` is an integer between 1 and 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least 3 integers; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `time_used` is 0; `points` is 0; `subtask_time` is the third element in the list `t`; if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time)`. Otherwise, the variables retain their initial values as no tasks can be completed due to insufficient remaining time.***
