Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 2; `k` is at least 1; `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k + 1` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `time_used` is equal to `2 * total_time_per_task`; if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time)`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task + max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `max_points` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `(k + 1 + subtasks_solved)`, `points` remains equal to `2 * (k + 1)`, and `subtask_time` is the next integer in `t` that is at least the index of 2. Otherwise, if `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, these conditions remain unchanged.***
