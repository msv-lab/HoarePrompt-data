The variable `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the value of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`. Given that `remaining_time` is equal to `M - total_time_per_task` and that `subtask_time` is the first element in the list `t`, we can express `max_subtasks_for_this_task` as `(M - total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`. The states of all other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 1, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to M - total_time_per_task, `subtask_time` is the first element in t, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to (M - total_time_per_task) // subtask_time.**
