Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 1; `k` is between 1 and 45; `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`; `points` is equal to `k + 1`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `(M - total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`; and `remaining_time` is equal to `(M - total_time_per_task) - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` if there is enough remaining time for at least one subtask; otherwise, `subtasks_solved` remains 0 and `remaining_time` stays as `M - total_time_per_task`.***
