The variable `max_points` is initialized to 0. The other variables remain unchanged as there are no operations involving them in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 45 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 (inclusive), `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` is between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, and `max_points` is 0.
