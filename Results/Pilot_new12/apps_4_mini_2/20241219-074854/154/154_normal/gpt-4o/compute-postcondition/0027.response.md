The variable `subtasks_solved` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and the calculated value `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. The value of `subtasks_solved` could change depending on the values of `n`, `complete_tasks`, and `k`. The other variables remain unaffected, so we need to express the updated state with the new value of `subtasks_solved`.

Given the conditions:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 45.
- `complete_tasks` is 0.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 45.
- The expression `(n - complete_tasks) * k` simplifies to `n * k` since `complete_tasks` is 0.

Since `subtasks_solved` is assigned the minimum of its previous value and `n * k`, the output state reflects that:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 0; `k` is an integer between 1 and 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `time_used` is 0; `points` is 0; `subtasks_solved` is `min(subtasks_solved, n * k)`; `remaining_time` is equal to the initial `M` minus the total time spent on completed subtasks, which is less than or equal to `M`.**
