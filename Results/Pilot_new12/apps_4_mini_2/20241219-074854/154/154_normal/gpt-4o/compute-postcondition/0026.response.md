Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 0; `k` is an integer between 1 and 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `time_used` is 0; `points` is 0; `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks solved across all elements in `t`; `remaining_time` is equal to the initial `M` minus the total time spent on completed subtasks, which is less than or equal to `M`.**
