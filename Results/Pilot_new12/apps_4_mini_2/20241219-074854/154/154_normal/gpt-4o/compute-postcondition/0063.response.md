Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `time_used` is equal to `2 * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_points` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `(k + 1 + subtasks_solved)`, `points` is equal to `2 * (k + 1)`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`, and `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`. The current value of `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.***
