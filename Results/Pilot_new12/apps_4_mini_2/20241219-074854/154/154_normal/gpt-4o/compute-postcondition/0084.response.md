Functionality: **The function `func_1` calculates the maximum points that can be achieved based on completed tasks and additional subtasks that can be solved given a time constraint. It takes four parameters: `n` (the total number of tasks), `k` (the number of subtasks per task), `M` (the total available time), and `t` (a list of time requirements for each subtask). The function iterates over all possible numbers of completed tasks, calculates the time used, and determines how many subtasks can be completed within the remaining time, ensuring that the total points do not exceed the limits imposed by the problem constraints. The final output is the maximum possible points achievable, factoring in both completed tasks and subtasks solved, while ensuring no time limit is breached. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `M` is very small, making it impossible to complete any tasks or subtasks, as well as when `n` or `k` is at its maximum limits, which may affect the total achievable points. If `complete_tasks` exceeds `n`, the function breaks early, ensuring that the loop does not process invalid states. The function will return a value of 0 when no tasks can be completed.**
