The variable `subtasks_solved` is assigned the value `0`, which means that regardless of its previous value, it is now explicitly set to `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that `subtasks_solved` is updated directly and has become `0`, the output state incorporates this change, while retaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 2; `k` is between 1 and 45; `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `time_used` is equal to `2 * total_time_per_task`; `subtasks_solved` is 0; `max_points` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `(k + 1 + subtasks_solved)`; `points` is equal to `2 * (k + 1)`; `remaining_time = M - time_used`.**
