Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is updated to `M - (M // t[0]) * t[0]`, `subtasks_solved` is set to the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved for the current task, `subtask_time` is equal to `t[0]`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `M // t[0]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
