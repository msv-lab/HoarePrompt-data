The variable `time_used` is calculated as `complete_tasks` multiplied by `total_time_per_task`. The initial state indicates that `complete_tasks` is 0, and `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in list `t`, which remains unchanged. Since `complete_tasks` is 0, the value of `time_used` will also be 0 regardless of the value of `total_time_per_task`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, and `time_used` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `time_used` is 0**.
