Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 2; `k` is between 1 and 45; `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `time_used` is equal to `2 * total_time_per_task`; `points` is equal to `k + 1`; `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `(n - 1) * k`; `max_points` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `(k + 1 + subtasks_solved)`; `remaining_time` is unchanged.**
