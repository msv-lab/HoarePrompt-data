Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 0; `k` is an integer between 1 and 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is 0; `time_used` is 0; `points` is 0; `subtask_time` is the second element in the list `t`; if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `remaining_time` is decremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `complete_tasks`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, `time_used`, `points`, `subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` remain unchanged.***
