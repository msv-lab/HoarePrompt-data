According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `complete_tasks` and the value of `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `complete_tasks` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `complete_tasks` is 1 and `n` is between 1 and 45. For the loop to execute one more time, `complete_tasks` will increase by 1, resulting in a new value of 2. Since `n` can be at least 2 for the loop to execute again (specifically, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2). 

Thus, to ensure the loop can continue, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 2; `k` is between 1 and 45; `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`; `points` is equal to `k + 1`; `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `(n - 1) * k`; `max_points` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `(k + 1 + subtasks_solved)`; `remaining_time` is unchanged.**
