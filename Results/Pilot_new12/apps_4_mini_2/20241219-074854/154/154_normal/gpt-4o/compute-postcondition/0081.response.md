Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45; `complete_tasks` is between 0 and `n`; `k` is an integer between 1 and 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` is between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is the maximum points achievable based on the number of completed tasks and the subtasks solved, which cannot exceed `(n * k) + (n - complete_tasks) * k`; `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`; `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`; `subtasks_solved` is updated to the minimum of the previous `subtasks_solved` over each iteration and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`; `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used` and will be non-negative if the loop terminates without exceeding `M`.**
