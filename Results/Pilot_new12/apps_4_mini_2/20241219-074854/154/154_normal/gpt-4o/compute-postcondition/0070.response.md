Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 2; `k` is at least 1; `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k + 1` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `time_used` is equal to `2 * total_time_per_task`; `subtasks_solved` is equal to its previous value plus `max_subtasks_for_this_task + max_subtasks_for_this_task`; `max_points` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `(k + 1 + subtasks_solved)`; `points` is equal to `2 * (k + 1)`; `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used - max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`; `subtask_time` is the next element in `t`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
