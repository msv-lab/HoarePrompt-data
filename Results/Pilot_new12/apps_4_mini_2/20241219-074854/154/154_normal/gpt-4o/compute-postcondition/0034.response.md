In the given code, `remaining_time` is calculated as the difference between `M` and `time_used`. The initial conditions state that `M` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9) and `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, which is the sum of the elements in `t`. This means that `remaining_time` will be the remaining time after the subtasks have been completed and their associated time has been accounted for.

Since `remaining_time` is assigned the value of `M - time_used`, the new value of `remaining_time` will be `M - total_time_per_task`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9, `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `subtasks_solved` is min(subtasks_solved, n * k), `remaining_time` is equal to M - total_time_per_task.**
