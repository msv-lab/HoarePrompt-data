The `remaining_time` variable is assigned the value of `M - time_used`. The values of `M` and `time_used` will determine the exact value of `remaining_time`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. 

Since `M` is a non-negative integer with constraints (0 <= M <= 2·10^9) and `time_used` is currently 0, the value of `remaining_time` will be equal to `M`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to `M`.**
