Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 1; `k` is between 1 and 45; `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k + 1` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`; `points` is equal to `k + 1`; if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. Otherwise, `subtasks_solved` remains 0 and `remaining_time` stays as `M - total_time_per_task`.***
