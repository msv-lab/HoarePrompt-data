The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the current loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9, `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is min(subtasks_solved, n * k), `remaining_time` is equal to the initial M minus the total time spent on completed subtasks, which is less than or equal to M, and we break out of the current loop or if statement.
