`points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The value of `complete_tasks` is 0, so `points` becomes `0 * (k + 1)`, which equals 0. The values of `n`, `complete_tasks`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`, and `time_used` are not affected by this specific assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `time_used` is 0, `points` is 0.**
