The expression `max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)` updates the value of `max_points`. The previous value of `max_points` is 0, and the new value is determined by the maximum of the previous `max_points` and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. Since `subtasks_solved` is capped at `n * k`, `points + subtasks_solved` will evaluate to `points + min(subtasks_solved, n * k)` but explicitly depends on the actual values of `points` and `subtasks_solved`.

Therefore, assuming no other operations affect these variables, the possible outcomes for `max_points` will depend on the current values:

1. If `points + subtasks_solved` (which is `points + min(subtasks_solved, n * k)`) is less than or equal to the current `max_points` (0), `max_points` remains 0.
2. If `points + subtasks_solved` is greater than 0, `max_points` will be updated to this new non-negative integer value.

Since no specific values for `points` and `subtasks_solved` are provided, I will express the output state in terms of their relationship.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 0; `k` is an integer between 1 and 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `max_points` is either 0 or points + subtasks_solved; `time_used` is 0; `points` is 0; `subtasks_solved` is min(subtasks_solved, n * k); `remaining_time` is equal to the initial M minus the total time spent on completed subtasks, which is less than or equal to M.**
