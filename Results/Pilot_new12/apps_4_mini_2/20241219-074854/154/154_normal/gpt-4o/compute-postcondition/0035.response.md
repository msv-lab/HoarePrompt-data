The value of `subtasks_solved` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `subtasks_solved` depended on the minimum of itself and `n * k`, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `remaining_time` is equal to M - total_time_per_task.**
