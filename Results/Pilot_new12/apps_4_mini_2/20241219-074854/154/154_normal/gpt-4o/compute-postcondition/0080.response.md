The variable `max_points` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. The values for `points` and `subtasks_solved` are known from the initial state details. We are also informed that `max_points` can currently hold some previous value. Therefore, we first evaluate `points`, which is equal to `2 * (k + 1)`, and `subtasks_solved` is updated to `min(subtasks_solved, (n - 2) * k)`. 

After running the code:
- `max_points` becomes `max(max_points, 2 * (k + 1) + subtasks_solved)` 

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 2; `k` is at least 1; `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `time_used` is equal to `2 * total_time_per_task`; `subtasks_solved` is updated to min(`subtasks_solved`, (n - 2) * k); `max_points` is updated to max(`max_points`, 2 * (k + 1) + subtasks_solved); `points` is equal to `2 * (k + 1)`; `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`; `subtask_time` is not applicable.**
