The variable `total_time_per_task` is assigned the sum of all the integers in the list `t`. The variable `t` contains `k` integers, each between 1 and 1,000,000. The value of `total_time_per_task` will therefore depend on the specific values in `t`. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 (inclusive), `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer `t[j]` is between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`.**
