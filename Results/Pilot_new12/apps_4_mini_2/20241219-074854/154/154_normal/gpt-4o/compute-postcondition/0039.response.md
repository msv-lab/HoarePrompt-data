To update the output state, we first need to identify how many subtasks can be solved. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{max\_subtasks\_for\_this\_task} = \frac{M - \text{total\_time\_per\_task}}{\text{subtask\_time}} \]

After calculating this value, `subtasks_solved` will be incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. 

Now, let’s break it into parts with the initial state provided:

1. `remaining_time` = `M - total_time_per_task` (this is already defined).
2. `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`.
3. Thus, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` can be determined, which will be a non-negative integer since `M` is always greater than or equal to `total_time_per_task` under valid conditions of our scenario.

Given these calculations and changes, the new value of `subtasks_solved` will be the previous value incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 1, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `subtasks_solved` increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `remaining_time` is equal to M - total_time_per_task, `subtask_time` is the first element in t, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to (M - total_time_per_task) // subtask_time.**
