Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `complete_tasks` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= M <= 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, and `time_used` is 0. If `time_used` is greater than `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.***
