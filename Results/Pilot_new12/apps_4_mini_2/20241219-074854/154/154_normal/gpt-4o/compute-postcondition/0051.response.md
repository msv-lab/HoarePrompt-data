Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 1; `k` is between 1 and 45; `M` is between 0 and 2Â·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k + 1` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`; `points` is equal to `k + 1`; if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `remaining_time` is equal to `R - (MST * ST)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `subtasks_solved` has increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.***
