The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. 

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 45 (inclusive).
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 (inclusive).
- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
- `t` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer `t[j]` is between 1 and 1,000,000 (inclusive).

After executing the function body, it returns the maximum points achievable based on the number of completed tasks and the subtasks solved, which cannot exceed \((n * k) + (n - complete\_tasks) * k\).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and t, and returns the maximum points achievable based on the number of completed tasks and the subtasks solved, limited by a specified formula.**
