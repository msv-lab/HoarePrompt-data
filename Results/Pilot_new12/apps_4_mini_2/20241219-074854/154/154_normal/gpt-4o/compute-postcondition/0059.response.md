The variable `points` is updated with the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. Here, `complete_tasks` is 2, and `k` is between 1 and 45, so the value of `points` will be computed as `2 * (k + 1)`, which depends on the value of `k`. The other variable states remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 45; `complete_tasks` is 2; `k` is between 1 and 45; `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9; `t` is a list of at least `k` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`; `time_used` is equal to `2 * total_time_per_task`; `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `(n - 1) * k`; `max_points` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `(k + 1 + subtasks_solved)`; `remaining_time` is unchanged if `time_used` is less than or equal to `M`; `points` is equal to `2 * (k + 1)`.
