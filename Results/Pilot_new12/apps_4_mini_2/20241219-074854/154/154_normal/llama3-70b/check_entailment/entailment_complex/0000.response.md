To determine the correctness of the provided annotated program based on the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the code and compare its functionality against the requirements stated in the problem description.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. **Inputs**: 
   - n (number of tasks), k (number of subtasks per task), M (total time available).
   - t (a list of k integers representing the time required to complete each subtask).

2. **Output**: 
   - The maximum number of points Polycarp can achieve within the given time M, where he earns 1 point for each completed subtask and an extra point for completing all k subtasks in a task.

### Annotations in the Code:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads n, k, M, and the list t (which are declared in the function comments).

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - A DP table `dp` is created to keep track of the maximum number of subtasks solved for every possible time from 1 to M using the available subtasks.
   - Each `dp[i][j]` entry represents the maximum number of subtasks solved using the first `i` subtasks with j minutes available.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - For each subtask `i`, it checks every possible time `j` from 1 to M.
   - It maintains the value from the previous DP entry if the current time `j` does not allow for the completion of subtask `i`.
   - If the time allows, it updates the DP table with the maximum value between not using the subtask or using it (increasing the count of solved subtasks).

4. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum points by summing the maximum number of subtasks solved under the full time `M` across all subtasks and adds 1 point for each full task completed (determined by whether the maximum number of subtasks solved matches the number of subtasks available).

### Analysis of Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates how many subtasks can be completed given the time constraints and correctly implements the logic to include the extra point for fully solving a task.
- **Overall Structure**: The dynamic programming approach is appropriately used here, and it correctly tracks how many tasks can be completed based on the time spent.
- **Points Calculation**: The final points calculation correctly accounts for the possible full solutions of the tasks.
  
Given these considerations, the program adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description:

- The input is properly gathered and formatted.
- The logic for calculating the maximum points based on the available time and subtasks follows the conditions provided.
- The final output meets the requirement of reporting the maximum points Polycarp can earn.

### Conclusion:
The provided annotated program meets the problem description as it accurately implements the logic required to compute the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the provided time constraints. 

Correctness: **True**
