To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to check whether the algorithm accurately calculates the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn given `n` tasks, `k` subtasks per task, and `M` minutes of time using provided subtask durations.

### Analysis of the program:

1. **Understanding Inputs:**
   - The program reads integers `n`, `k`, and `M`. 
   - It reads `k` integers representing the time `t_j` for solving each subtask.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - The program utilizes a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
     - `i` represents the index of the subtasks considered (from `1` to `k`).
     - `j` represents the total available time (from `0` to `M`).
   - The idea is to fill this table so that `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved using up to `j` minutes considering the first `i` subtasks.

3. **Update Logic:**
   - The program counts the number of subtasks solved if the same time is used from the previous step (`dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`).
   - If enough time remains for the subtask `i`, it considers solving the subtask and updates the DP table accordingly.

4. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The program sums the maximum points from `dp[i][M]` for all `i`, adding `1` point for each complete task solved (where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`).

### Issues Identified:

1. **Task Completion Logic:**
   - The program currently does not correctly account for the maximum number of tasks Polycarp can complete fully. The addition of extra points does not take into account whether the total time spent on subtasks allows for forming complete tasks first.
   - It also does not track how many complete tasks are solvable under the time `M`.

### Test Case to Highlight Issues:
- Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3 4 10
1 2 3 4
```
Expected Output:
Polycarp can complete all subtasks of the first task (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes) and would earn `4 (subtasks) + 1 (bonus) = 5 points`.
He cannot solve any more subtasks from the second and third task because he has no minutes left.

The program, however, is structured to simply count subtasks, resulting in a different point calculation because it does not ensure tasks are fully completed (it focuses on maximizing individual subtasks instead).

### Therefore:

Correctness: **False**

The program cannot guarantee a correct solution as it improperly accumulates subtasks that can be completed without ensuring that full tasks are counted first, leading to incorrect point values being assigned for certain scenarios as demonstrated.
