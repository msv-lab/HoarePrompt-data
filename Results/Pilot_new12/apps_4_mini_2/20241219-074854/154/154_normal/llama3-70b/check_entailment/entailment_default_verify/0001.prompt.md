You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to check whether the algorithm accurately calculates the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn given `n` tasks, `k` subtasks per task, and `M` minutes of time using provided subtask durations.

### Analysis of the program:

1. **Understanding Inputs:**
   - The program reads integers `n`, `k`, and `M`. 
   - It reads `k` integers representing the time `t_j` for solving each subtask.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - The program utilizes a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
     - `i` represents the index of the subtasks considered (from `1` to `k`).
     - `j` represents the total available time (from `0` to `M`).
   - The idea is to fill this table so that `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved using up to `j` minutes considering the first `i` subtasks.

3. **Update Logic:**
   - The program counts the number of subtasks solved if the same time is used from the previous step (`dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`).
   - If enough time remains for the subtask `i`, it considers solving the subtask and updates the DP table accordingly.

4. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The program sums the maximum points from `dp[i][M]` for all `i`, adding `1` point for each complete task solved (where `dp[i][M]` equals `i`).

### Issues Identified:

1. **Task Completion Logic:**
   - The program currently does not correctly account for the maximum number of tasks Polycarp can complete fully. The addition of extra points does not take into account whether the total time spent on subtasks allows for forming complete tasks first.
   - It also does not track how many complete tasks are solvable under the time `M`.

### Test Case to Highlight Issues:
- Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3 4 10
1 2 3 4
```
Expected Output:
Polycarp can complete all subtasks of the first task (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes) and would earn `4 (subtasks) + 1 (bonus) = 5 points`.
He cannot solve any more subtasks from the second and third task because he has no minutes left.

The program, however, is structured to simply count subtasks, resulting in a different point calculation because it does not ensure tasks are fully completed (it focuses on maximizing individual subtasks instead).

### Therefore:

Correctness: **False**

The program cannot guarantee a correct solution as it improperly accumulates subtasks that can be completed without ensuring that full tasks are counted first, leading to incorrect point values being assigned for certain scenarios as demonstrated.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes inputs regarding a maximum item selection problem, where it receives an integer `n`, an integer `k`, a non-negative integer `M`, and a list `t` of `k` integers. It computes a dynamic programming table `dp` that tracks the maximum number of items that can be selected given a maximum weight capacity from `1` to `M`. After populating the table, it prints the sum of selected items for the full capacity `M` as well as the count of exact full selections that equal the total number of items selected. The function does not return values; it only prints results, and it assumes valid input as described, but does not handle cases where the inputs may be out of bounds or invalid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
