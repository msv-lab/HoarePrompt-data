You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the implementation and see if it meets the criteria.

The problem is about determining the maximum points Polycarp can earn given the time constraints. He earns points by solving subtasks, and solving all subtasks of a task yields additional points.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads integers `n`, `k`, and `M`, followed by a list of integers representing time requirements for each subtask.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: The program initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks Polycarp can complete using `j` minutes with the first `i` subtasks considered.
3. **Double Loops**: 
   - The outer loop iterates over each subtask.
   - The inner loop iterates over available minutes.
   - The innermost logic checks if the task can be completed in the current amount of time and updates the DP table accordingly.
4. **Output Calculation**: The program sums the points from tasks that were completely solved and adds them to the points from subtasks solved according to the DP results.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Minimum Input Values**: What if `n = 1`, `k = 1`, and `M = 0`? The output should logically be `0`, as no subtasks can be completed.
2. **Maximum Time**: What if `M` is much larger than the total time required to complete all subtasks for all tasks? This case should yield maximum points, i.e., `n * (k + 1)`.
3. **Insufficient Time**: If `M` is less than the time required for the first subtask, do we get the correct output?
4. **Uneven Distribution of Subtask Times**: If `t` values are disparate, it could lead to complex decision-making on how many subtasks to complete across different tasks.

### Potential Failure Case:
Let’s take an example:
Input:
```
1 3 5
2 2 2
```
Expected output: Polycarp can only complete 2 subtasks (total time spent = 4) but not the entire task for the extra point; thus, he should earn `2` points.

Expected output for this input is `2`, since he can't complete all three subtasks or earn an extra point. However, if the logic in the program does not handle this correctly, it could yield a higher or incorrect total.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the logic and considering potential edge cases and the implementation of the DP approach, I did not find any direct issues with the algorithm that would yield an incorrect outcome based on all examined scenarios.

**Correctness:** **True**. 

The reasoning is clear in covering situations from minimal to sufficient time allocations, and the DP table is properly maintained to reflect maximum points earnable under the constraints outlined.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, M is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2·10^9, and t is a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `dp[k][1...M]` contains the maximum number of items that can be chosen for capacities ranging from 1 to `M` using all `k` items, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of items that can be chosen with the first `i` items and a total capacity of `j`.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
