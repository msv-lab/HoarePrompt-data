Based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code, it appears that the program is logically sound in its approach to solving the given problem. The program accurately implements a dynamic programming strategy to maximize the number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time constraints.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values and the list of required solving times, which matches the problem description.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program initializes a DP table (`dp`), where each entry keeps track of the maximum number of subtasks completed for various time limits.
   - The nested loops ensure that all subtasks are considered against possible remaining time, correctly updating the DP table based on whether the current subtask can be completed within the remaining time.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - After populating the DP table, the program correctly calculates the total possible points earned by summing up subtasks completed and the extra points for fully completed tasks.

### Annotations:
The annotations provide clear state information before and after the main loop execution, indicating that the inner logic of tracking subtasks is functioning as expected. The correctness of indexing and availability checks is crucial for ensuring the total points calculation reflects the maximum achievable under provided constraints.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment deemed the program correct, arguing that it handles various scenarios correctly, including edge cases. In light of the logic detailed in the annotated version and the program's adherence to the problem's requirements, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**.
