The variable `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. Since `j` is 1, this effectively means that `dp[i][1]` will take the value from `dp[i][0]`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `t`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `j` is 1, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][0]`.**
