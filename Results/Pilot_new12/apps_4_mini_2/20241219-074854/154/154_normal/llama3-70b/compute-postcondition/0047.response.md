Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `i` is 1, `j` is 3; if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[1][3]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0][3 - t[0]] + 1`, while `dp[1][2]` remains unchanged.***
