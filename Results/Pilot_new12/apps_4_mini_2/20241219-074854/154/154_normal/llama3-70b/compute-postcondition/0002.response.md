The operation `t.sort()` modifies the list `t` by sorting its elements in ascending order. The previous state of `t` is not specified in terms of its content, only that it consists of `k` integers each ranging between 1 and 1,000,000. Since sorting changes the order of the elements in `t`, we can't restate the exact values after the sorting without knowing the original order of `t`. However, we can confirm that `t` is now sorted. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the sort operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2Â·10^9 inclusive, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000.**
