The statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` indicates that the value at position `j` in the `i`-th list of the `dp` array is being updated to the value at position `j - 1` in the same list. This means that the specific values for `i` and `j` will determine what is in `dp[i][j]` after execution. 

The impact on the program is limited to the specific element of the `dp` array being assigned a new value. The other variables remain unchanged, namely `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `j`, which was stated as `M + 1`. 

Since no values are specified for `i` and `j`, we cannot calculate the exact output for `dp[i][j]`, but it will hold the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `j` is `M + 1`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
