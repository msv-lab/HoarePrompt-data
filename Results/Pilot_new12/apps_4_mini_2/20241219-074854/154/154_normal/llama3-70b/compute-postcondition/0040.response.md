According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. The variable `j` will start at 1 and go until `M`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since `M` is at least 1, the loop can execute again.

For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `M` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 2, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
