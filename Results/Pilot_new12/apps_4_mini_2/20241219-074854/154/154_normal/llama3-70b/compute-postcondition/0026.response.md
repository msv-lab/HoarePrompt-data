The given code assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. Since `j` is `M + 1`, we can represent the operation as `dp[i][M + 1] = dp[i][M]`. The previous values of the affected variables `dp` are not specified, but `dp[i][j]` is now equal to the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `dp[i][M + 1]` is now equal to `dp[i][M]`, while the conditions for `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `j` is `M + 1`, and `dp[i][M + 1] = dp[i][M]`.**
