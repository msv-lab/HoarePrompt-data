According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `M`. The loop executes for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `M`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `M + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must reset to 1 for the next iteration, which means that in the subsequent iteration, `j` will increase from 1 up to `M`. Thus, you need to adjust `j` to reflect the next starting value. 

Since `j` must be less than or equal to `M` to further execute the loop, no change is needed for `M` or any other variables because `M` is already set at least to 1, and it does not need to be modified to satisfy the loop's conditions. 

State: **`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `j` is 1**
