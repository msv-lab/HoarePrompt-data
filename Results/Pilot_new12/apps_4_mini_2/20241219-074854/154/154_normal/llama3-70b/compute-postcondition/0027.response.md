The code snippet `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of its current value or the value of `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

Given that:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive,
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive,
- `M` is at least 1,
- `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000,
- `j` is `M + 1`,
- `dp[i][M + 1] = dp[i][M]` (which implies that the last column is initialized the same as the column just before it)

Based on this code, we can deduce that:
- The value at `dp[i][j]` may be updated based on the maximum operation involving `dp[i][j]` itself and a calculation that uses values from the previous iteration `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` plus 1. 

Since the actual values of `dp`, `i`, and `t` are not provided, we cannot specify exact numbers but can express that the values of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` will affect the output.

The output does not provide numerical values but indicates that the state of the dynamic programming table would include these outputs depending on the values of `i`, `j`, and the list `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `j` is M + 1, and `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of its previous value or `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.**
