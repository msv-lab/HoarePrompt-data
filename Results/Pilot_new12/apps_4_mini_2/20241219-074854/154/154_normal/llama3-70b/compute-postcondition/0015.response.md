The line of code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. Since `j` is currently 1 (as stated in the initial state), this means that `dp[i][1]` will be assigned the value of `dp[i][0]`. 

Assuming that `dp` is a 2D array defined for the values of `i` and `j`, the rest of the parameters such as `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State reflects that `dp[i][j]` becomes equal to `dp[i][j-1]`, and specifically, `j` is updated at the index of 1.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `j` is 1, `dp[i][1]` is equal to `dp[i][0]`.**
