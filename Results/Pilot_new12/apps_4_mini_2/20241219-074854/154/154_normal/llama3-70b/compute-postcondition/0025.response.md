According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 1 to `M + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, it is implied that the loop has reached `j = M`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `M + 1`. 

However, since `j` must be within the defined range, we need to ensure that `M` allows for this increment. As `M` is at least 1, the loop can execute for `j = 1` to `M`, and the next increment would be `M + 1`.

Thus, we need to adjust `j` to be `M + 1` to account for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `j` is `M + 1`**
