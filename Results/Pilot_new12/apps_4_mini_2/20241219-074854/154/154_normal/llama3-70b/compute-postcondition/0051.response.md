The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

1. `n`: an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive.
2. `k`: an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive.
3. `M`: a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2·10^9.
4. `t`: a list of `k` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000.

The function's output is dependent on the specified conditions involving these parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`, which adhere to the specified constraints. The specific output behavior based on these parameters is not described in the provided constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 45), k (an integer between 1 and 45), M (a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2·10^9), and t (a list of k integers each between 1 and 1,000,000).**
