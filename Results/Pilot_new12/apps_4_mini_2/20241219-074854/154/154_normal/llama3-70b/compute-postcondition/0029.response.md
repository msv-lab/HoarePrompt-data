According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `M` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `M + 1`, which means it has exceeded the upper limit for the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be set back to 1. Additionally, since the loop runs from 1 to `M`, `M` must remain at least 1 for the loop to execute at all since `M` is specified to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `j` is 1**
