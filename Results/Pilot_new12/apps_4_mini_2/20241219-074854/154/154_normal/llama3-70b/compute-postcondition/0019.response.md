According to the code, the for loop will iterate over `i` starting from 1 up to `k` (inclusive). The loop will execute `k` times in total. At the end of the last iteration, `i` corresponds to one of the values between 1 and `k`. To allow for one more execution of the loop, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `k + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` has to be between 1 and `k`, therefore, `k` needs to be at least `k` (which is already true as per the given state). 

Thus, the new state needs to reflect that `i` has been incremented to `k + 1`, while all other variables can remain unchanged.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `dp[1][1...M]` contains the maximum number of items that can be chosen with capacities from 1 to `M`, and `i` is `k + 1`**
