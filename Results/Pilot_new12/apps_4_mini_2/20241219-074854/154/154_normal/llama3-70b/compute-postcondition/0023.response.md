The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the maximum of its current value and the value from the previous row and column (`dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]`) incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected, but the outcome of the update depends on the current values of `dp[i][j]`, `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]`, and the specific element at `t[i - 1]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.**
