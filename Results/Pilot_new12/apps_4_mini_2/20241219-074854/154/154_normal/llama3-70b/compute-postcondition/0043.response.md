Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 2, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[1][2]` is updated to the maximum of the previous `dp[1][2]` and `dp[1][1] + 1`, while `dp[1][1]` remains unchanged.***
