Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `i` is 1, `j` is `M`, and `dp[1][1...M]` contains the maximum number of items that can be chosen for capacities ranging from 1 to `M`. After all iterations, `dp[1][j]` holds the maximum items that can be chosen with capacity `j` considering the first item `t[0]`.**
