Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, and `dp[1][1...M]` contains the maximum number of items that can be chosen with capacities from 1 to `M` given the first item with weight `t[0]`. The value of `dp[1][j]` for `j` in the range 1 to `M` reflects whether the item with weight `t[0]` is included in the selection based on its weight and the current capacity, while `dp[0][j]` remains 0 for all `j`.**
