Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and dp[1][j] is now equal to dp[1][j - 1]. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to the first element of `t`, which is `t[i - 1]`.***
