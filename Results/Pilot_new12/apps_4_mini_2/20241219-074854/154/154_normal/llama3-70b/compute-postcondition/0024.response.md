Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.***
