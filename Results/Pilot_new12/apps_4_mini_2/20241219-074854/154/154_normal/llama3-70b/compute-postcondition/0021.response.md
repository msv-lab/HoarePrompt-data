The statement `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value from the previous column in the `dp` array at the same row `i` to the current cell at row `i` and column `j`. This means that the number of items that can be chosen with a capacity represented by `j` without the item at position `i` is taken from the number of items that can be chosen with a capacity represented by `j-1`. 

Since only the value of `dp[i][j]` is being updated in this operation, and no other variables are affected, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `dp[1][1...M]` is updated with `dp[i][j]` taking the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`, `j` remains 1.**
