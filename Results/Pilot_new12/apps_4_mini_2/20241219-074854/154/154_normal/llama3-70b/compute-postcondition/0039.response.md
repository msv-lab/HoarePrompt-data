Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `i` is 1, `j` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[0]`, then `dp[1][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[1][j]` and `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[1][j]` remains unchanged.***
