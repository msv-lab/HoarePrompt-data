The code snippet initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, filled with zeros. Given the initial state, the dimensions of `dp` depend on the values of `k` and `M`. As `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k + 1` ranges from 2 to 46. The variable `M` can range from 1 to 2·10^9, thus `M + 1` ranges from 2 to 2·10^9 + 1. The list is filled such that each row is a collection of zeros.

The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` remain unaffected, but `dp` now holds a 2D list of dimensions `(k + 1)` by `(M + 1)` with all elements initialized to zero. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2·10^9 inclusive, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `dp` is a list of 0s with dimensions (k + 1) by (M + 1)**.
