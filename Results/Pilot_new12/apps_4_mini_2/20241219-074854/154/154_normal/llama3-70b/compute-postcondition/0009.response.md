Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[0][j - t[0]] + 1`, with `i` set to 1.***
