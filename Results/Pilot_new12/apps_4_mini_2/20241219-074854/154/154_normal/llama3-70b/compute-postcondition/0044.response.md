According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the limit set by `M`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `M` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3 for the next iteration. 

Since `j` must be less than or equal to `M` for the loop to execute, the conditions indicate that `M` must be at least 3 for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 3, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, `i` is 1, and `j` is 3**
