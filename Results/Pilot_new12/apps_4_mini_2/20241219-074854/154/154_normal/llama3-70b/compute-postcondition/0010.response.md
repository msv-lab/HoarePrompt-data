To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions surrounding the variables involved, particularly `j` and `M`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is within the range of `1` to `M`, and the loop executes for each value of `j` starting from `1` up to `M`. The loop will terminate once `j` exceeds `M`. 

Since `i` is set to `1` in the previous iteration (based on the context), this is not directly relevant to the current `j` loop, which depends solely on the value of `j`.

Now consider the maximum value of `j` which is `M`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must allow `j` to be incremented, meaning `j` must be less than `M`, which signifies we need to prepare for the next value of `j`.

Therefore, if `j` is currently `M`, to allow the loop to execute again, we need to increment `j` to `M + 1`, and the loop should terminate at that point since `j` will exceed `M`.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `j` would be `M + 1`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 45 inclusive, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, j is M + 1**
