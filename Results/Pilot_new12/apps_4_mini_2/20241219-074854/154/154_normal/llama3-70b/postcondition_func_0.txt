The function processes inputs regarding a maximum item selection problem, where it receives an integer `n`, an integer `k`, a non-negative integer `M`, and a list `t` of `k` integers. It computes a dynamic programming table `dp` that tracks the maximum number of items that can be selected given a maximum weight capacity from `1` to `M`. After populating the table, it prints the sum of selected items for the full capacity `M` as well as the count of exact full selections that equal the total number of items selected. The function does not return values; it only prints results, and it assumes valid input as described, but does not handle cases where the inputs may be out of bounds or invalid.
