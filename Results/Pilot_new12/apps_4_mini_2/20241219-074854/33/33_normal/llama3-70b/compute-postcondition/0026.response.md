According to the code, the loop will iterate `n` times. The state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 50. At the end of the last iteration, since we are currently on an iteration and have not yet completed all `n` iterations, we can infer that the loop has executed a certain number of times and still has iterations left.

The loop is set to execute for `n` iterations, and after the last iteration, the loop counter (represented as `_`) is implicitly understood to increase. If the loop has already executed, say `k` times where `k < n`, for the loop to continue, it must execute again with `k + 1`. 

Since `n` is between 1 and 50, and we do not know the exact value of `k`, we know that `n` should still be greater than `k`. But rather than explicitly calculating `k`, we can infer that the state must simply reflect the remaining iterations. Thus, to execute one more time, `n` remains the same, but we should acknowledge that we've completed another iteration.

Thus, we require to express that one additional iteration is executed, bringing the loop closer to completion.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50;** (remains unchanged as the value of n is constant), and since the loop has executed one more iteration, we now note that the loop must execute a total of `n - 1` iterations left. However, we do not know the current iteration number, so we do not need to declare that specifically. 

In conclusion, no additional variables were changed. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50**
