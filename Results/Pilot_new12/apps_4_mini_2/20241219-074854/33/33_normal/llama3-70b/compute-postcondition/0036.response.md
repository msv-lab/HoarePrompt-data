Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value. If `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, then `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and the program execution is terminated. If `curr_lat` is within the valid range, there are no changes to `curr_lat`, and the program proceeds with further operations.***
