The `exit()` function stops the execution of the program, but it does not change the values of any variables. Thus, all previous states of the variables remain the same. The output state will indicate that the execution stopped due to the exit command.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or another value, `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and program execution has exited.**
