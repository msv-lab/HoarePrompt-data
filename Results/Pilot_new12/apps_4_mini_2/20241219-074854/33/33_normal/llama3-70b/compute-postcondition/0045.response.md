The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the current value of `t` (that is the first input value) to an integer. The value of `t` will remain within the bounds of an integer, as it was initially set to the first input value. Other variables have not been affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is set to the second input value; `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
