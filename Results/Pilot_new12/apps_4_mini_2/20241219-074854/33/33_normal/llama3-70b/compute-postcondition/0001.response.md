The variable `curr_lat` is assigned the value `90`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 50, but the assignment to `curr_lat` does not affect `n`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `curr_lat` while retaining the information about `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90**
