Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `curr_lat`.***
