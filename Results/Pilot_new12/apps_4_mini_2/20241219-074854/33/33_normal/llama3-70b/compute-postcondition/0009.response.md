The code `curr_lat -= t / 111.195` modifies the value of `curr_lat` by subtracting `t / 111.195`. The variable `curr_lat` starts at 90, and the value of `t` is an integer, but it is unspecified. Therefore, we cannot calculate the new exact value of `curr_lat` without knowing the value of `t`. 

The other variables remain unchanged, and the constraints on `n` and `dir` still hold since they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90 - (t / 111.195), `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'South'**.
