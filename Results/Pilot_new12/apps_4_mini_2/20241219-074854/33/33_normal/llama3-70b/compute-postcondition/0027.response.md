The variables `t` and `dir` are assigned values based on the input split into two parts. Since the values of `t` and `dir` are determined by user input, their exact values cannot be specified. The variable `n` remains unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an input value; `dir` is an input value**
