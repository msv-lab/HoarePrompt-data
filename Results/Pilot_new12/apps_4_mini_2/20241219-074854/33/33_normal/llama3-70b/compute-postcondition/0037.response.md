The code snippet simply prints 'NO'. Since the values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` are not affected by the print statement, they remain unchanged. The conditions related to `curr_lat` also remain valid as no changes are made to its state. Therefore, the output state indicates the unchanged values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value; `curr_lat` remains unchanged within its valid range.**
