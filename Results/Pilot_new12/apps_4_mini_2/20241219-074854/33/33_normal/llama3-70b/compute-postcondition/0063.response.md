Functionality: **The function takes an integer input `n` representing the number of journey parts, where each part includes a distance `t` and a direction `dir` that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". It calculates a cumulative latitude `curr_lat` starting from 90 degrees, adjusting it based on the distances for the specified directions. It only modifies `curr_lat` for "North" and "South" directions, while "West" and "East" directions are ignored. The function checks if `curr_lat` remains within the bounds of -90 to 90 degrees, printing 'NO' and exiting if it exceeds these limits or if it reaches the boundary values (-90 or 90) without the appropriate direction. After processing all journey parts, it prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` equals 90, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not handle invalid or malformed inputs, which could lead to exceptions if not controlled.**
