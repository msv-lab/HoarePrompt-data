Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value. If `curr_lat` equals 90 and `dir` is not 'South', `curr_lat` remains unchanged, the output is 'NO', and the program has exited. If `curr_lat` equals -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the execution exits and all variable values remain preserved. Otherwise, if `curr_lat` is within the valid range, it remains unchanged.***
