Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, and `dir` is not equal to 'South', the output is 'NO'. If `curr_lat` is within the range of -90 to 90, no additional action is taken. The current value of `curr_lat` is -90, and `dir` is not equal to 'North'.***
