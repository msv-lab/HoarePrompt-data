The `continue` statement is utilized to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, there are no variables being modified or returned as a result of the execution of this `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that any loop containing this `continue` statement is advanced to its next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is set to the second input value; `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
