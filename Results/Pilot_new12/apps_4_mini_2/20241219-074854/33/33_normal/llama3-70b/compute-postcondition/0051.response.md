The code snippet `print('NO')` will simply output the string 'NO' to the console without affecting any of the pre-existing variables. The values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged as no operations that modify these variables are present in the code provided. Therefore, the output state reflects only the unchanged initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or another value, `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
