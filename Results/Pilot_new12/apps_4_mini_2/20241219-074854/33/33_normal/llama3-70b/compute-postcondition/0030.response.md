The variable `curr_lat` is decremented by the value of `t / 111.195`. The value of `t` is not provided in the initial state or preconditions. Since `n` is constrained to the range of 1 to 50 but doesn't directly affect `curr_lat` or `t`, the state of those variables remains unknown except for their defined ranges. 

The state of the affected variable `curr_lat` changes, but we cannot determine its specific initial value or the result after the decrement since `t` is unspecified. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value; `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value; `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195**.
