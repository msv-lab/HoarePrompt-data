The code `exit()` does not change the values of any variables, but it terminates the program execution. The values of the variables `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain as they were before the exit call. Therefore, the Output State reflects that the program was terminated, but the state of the variables is unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value; `curr_lat` is unchanged; the program execution is terminated.**
