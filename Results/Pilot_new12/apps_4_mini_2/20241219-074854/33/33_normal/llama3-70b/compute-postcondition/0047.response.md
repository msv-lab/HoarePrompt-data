The value of `curr_lat` is modified by subtracting `t / 111.195`. The variable `t` is an integer, and since the initial state of `curr_lat` remains unchanged, we denote the updated value of `curr_lat` as `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)`. The initial states of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` are unaffected outside of this calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is set to the second input value; `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)`**.
