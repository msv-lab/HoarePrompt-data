The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since the initial state provided does not indicate the context of a loop, we must assume that it is being executed within a loop. In this case, the values of `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged as the execution of `continue` does not affect these variables directly.

Thus, the Output State remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
