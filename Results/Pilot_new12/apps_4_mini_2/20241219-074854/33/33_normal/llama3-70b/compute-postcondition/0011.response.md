The command `continue` causes the program to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. This does not affect any variable directly, but it indicates that the loop will continue running without changes to the current state of variables.

The values of `n`, `curr_lat`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them, and we simply continue to the next loop iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is not equal to 'South'.**
