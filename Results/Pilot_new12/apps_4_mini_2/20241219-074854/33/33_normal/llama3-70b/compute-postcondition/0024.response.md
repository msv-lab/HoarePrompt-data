The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately, resulting in no change to the values of any variables, including `n`, `curr_lat`, and `dir`. However, since the program is exiting, the result of the program will not proceed any further.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is currently 90; `dir` is not equal to 'South'; the output of the program is 'NO', and the program has terminated.**
