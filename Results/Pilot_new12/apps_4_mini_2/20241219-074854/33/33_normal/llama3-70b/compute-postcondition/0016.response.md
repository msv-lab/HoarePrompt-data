The execution of `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. No variables are altered in this process, but the program no longer continues beyond this point. Therefore, the output state maintains the original values of all variables since no computation is performed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, `dir` is not equal to 'South', and the output is 'NO'.**
