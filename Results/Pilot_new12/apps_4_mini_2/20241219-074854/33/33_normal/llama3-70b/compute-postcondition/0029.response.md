The variable `curr_lat` is being updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The values of `n` and `dir` are not directly affected by this operation.

Since `t` is an integer and can take any value, the exact change in `curr_lat` depends on the value of `t`. The range of `n` does not impact the calculation in this context.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value; `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value; `curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195.**
