The `print('NO')` statement is executed, which outputs the string 'NO'. The other variables are not affected by this statement. 

Given that `dir` is not equal to 'South', `curr_lat` remains at its current value, which is either less than -90 or greater than 90.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90, `dir` is not equal to 'South', and the output is 'NO'.**
