The variable `curr_lat` is updated based on the equation `curr_lat += t / 111.195`. The variable `t` is an integer, but its specific value is not provided, so we treat it as a variable in the calculation. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90, and the operation alters this value. 

Thus, after the execution, the new value of `curr_lat` will be `90 + t / 111.195`. The conditions on `n`, `curr_lat`, and `dir` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is equal to 90 + t / 111.195, `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'North'**
