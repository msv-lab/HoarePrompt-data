In the given initial state, `t` is assigned the value `int(t)`, which converts the input value of `t` to an integer. The values of `n` and `dir` remain unaffected. Since `t` can be any input value prior to conversion, it will now specifically be an integer after this execution. 

Therefore, the output state recognizes that `n` remains an integer within the range of 1 to 50, while `t` is now defined as an integer, and `dir` remains unchanged as an input value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value**.
