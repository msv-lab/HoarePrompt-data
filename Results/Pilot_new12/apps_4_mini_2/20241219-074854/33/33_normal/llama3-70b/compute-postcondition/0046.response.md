The variable `curr_lat` is updated by adding the value of `t / 111.195` to its previous value. The variable `n` maintains its value within the defined range, `t` is a variable representing an integer, and `dir` has been assigned a value from the input. The status of `curr_lat` has changed, but the other variables remain unaffected. The new value of `curr_lat` will reflect the addition of `t` divided by 111.195 to its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is set to the second input value; `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195**
