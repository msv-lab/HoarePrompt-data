The values of `t` and `dir` are assigned the result of splitting the input string. However, without knowing the input provided, the specific values assigned to `t` and `dir` cannot be determined. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string**.
