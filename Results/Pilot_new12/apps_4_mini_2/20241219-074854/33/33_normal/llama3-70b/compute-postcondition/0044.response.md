The line `t, dir = input().split()` takes an input and splits it into two values. The first value is assigned to `t`, and the second value is assigned to `dir`. Since we don't know the exact values of the input, we can indicate that `t` and `dir` are now set to the input values. The value of `n` and `curr_lat` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50; `t` is set to the first input value; `dir` is set to the second input value; `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
