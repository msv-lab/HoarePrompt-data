The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. Therefore, none of the variables `n`, `t`, `dir`, or `curr_lat` will change, and the output will also remain the same. The state of the variables does not change, except that the program will stop execution, reflected in the output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is an input value; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; the output is 'NO', and the program has exited.**
