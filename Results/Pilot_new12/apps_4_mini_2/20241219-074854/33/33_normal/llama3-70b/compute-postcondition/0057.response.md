The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. Since `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the condition specified in the initial state is met, leading to this output. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that 'NO' was printed, and details of the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or another value, `curr_lat` is unchanged; 'NO' printed.**
