According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, this guarantees that the loop will execute at least once as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `curr_lat` does not affect the loop execution itself. 

Before the loop starts, `n` can be any integer within the specified range, and since the loop does not depend on any other variable, there are no adjustments needed to ensure the loop executes.

Thus, the state can remain as is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90**
