The code executes an `exit()` function, which stops the execution of the program. Therefore, no variables have their values changed, and the program does not continue to run. No specific values are returned; instead, the program halts execution altogether.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or another value; `curr_lat` is unchanged; 'NO' printed; program execution halted.**
