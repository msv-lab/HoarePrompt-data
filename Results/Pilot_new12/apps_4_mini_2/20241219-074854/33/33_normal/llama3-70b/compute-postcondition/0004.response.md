The value of `t` is assigned the result of `int(t)`, which converts `t` from a string format to an integer. Since `t` could be a string representation of any integer, the actual integer value of `t` becomes tangible after this conversion. The states of the other variables `n`, `curr_lat`, and `dir` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input string**.
