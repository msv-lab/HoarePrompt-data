The code checks the value of `curr_lat` and prints 'YES' if it is equal to 90; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 

Since `curr_lat` can change based on user inputs, we must consider the following scenarios:
- If `curr_lat` is exactly 90, it will print 'YES'.
- If `curr_lat` is any value other than 90 (including but not limited to -90, 0, or any other integer within the range), it will print 'NO'.

The variables `n`, `curr_lat`, `t`, and `dir` remain defined as per the initial state provided.

Thus, based on the values described:
- If `curr_lat` is exactly 90, we note that the last valid direction must be 'South' to satisfy the rules.
- If `curr_lat` is not 90, at least a 'NO' will be printed without an explicit mention of last direction due to input conditions impacting `curr_lat`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is currently within the bounds of -90 and 90 resulting in either 'YES' or 'NO' based on its value; last valid direction conditions apply based on recent latitude values.**
