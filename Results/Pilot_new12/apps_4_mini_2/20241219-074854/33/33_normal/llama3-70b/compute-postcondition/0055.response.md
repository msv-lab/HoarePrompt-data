The code `exit()` is a command that terminates the execution of the program immediately. Consequently, none of the variables will be altered, but we note the program has stopped running. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or another value, `curr_lat` is unchanged, and the output is 'NO'. The program has exited and no further execution will occur.**
