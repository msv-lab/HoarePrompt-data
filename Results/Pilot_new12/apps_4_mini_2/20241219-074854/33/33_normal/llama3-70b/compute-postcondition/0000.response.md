The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The constraints on `n` remain valid — it is still expected to be an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state includes the updated value of `n` based on external input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 (after input)**
