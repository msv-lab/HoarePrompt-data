The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but it relies on an internal logic that involves an integer `n`, where `n` is constrained to be between 1 and 50. Additionally, there are multiple parts of a journey described by pairs of values consisting of an integer `t_i` (with constraints of 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) and a string `dir_i`, which can be one of "North", "South", "West", or "East". 

Since the output is not explicitly described in the provided information, we infer that the function performs calculations or operations based on these journey parts and ultimately returns some result. However, without clear output details, we will only outline the function's parameters and constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) for the number of journey parts. Each journey part is described by an integer `t_i` (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) and a direction string `dir_i` which can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". The specific result of the function is not detailed.**
