Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is updated to 90 + t / 111.195 if `dir` is 'North', or updated to 90 - (t / 111.195) if `dir` is 'South'. Otherwise, `curr_lat` remains 90. `dir` is not equal to 'South'. The current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90.***
