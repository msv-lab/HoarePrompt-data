Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` < 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is set to the second input value. If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)`. Otherwise, `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
