Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is a latitude value that may change based on the inputs 't' and 'dir' received during the loop iterations, remaining within the bounds of -90 and 90. If `curr_lat` exceeds these bounds, 'NO' is printed, and the program exits. If `curr_lat` is 90, the last valid direction must be 'South' to avoid printing 'NO' and exiting. If `curr_lat` is -90, the last valid direction must be 'North' for the same reason. The values of 't' and 'dir' are determined by user input during each iteration of the loop.**
