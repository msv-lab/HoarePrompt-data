The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. As a result, none of the values of the variables are changed, but the execution stops. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is -90; `dir` is not equal to 'North'; output is 'NO' and the program has exited.**
