You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

-----Note-----

Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole. [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle all necessary conditions as specified in the problem description. Here is a potential test case that demonstrates this:

Consider the following input:

```
4
20000 South
1000 East
20000 North
1000 North
```

In this scenario:
1. Limak starts at the North Pole (90°).
2. He moves 20,000 kilometers South, which would place him at latitude -90° (the South Pole).
3. Next, he attempts to move 1,000 kilometers East. This is not allowed as per the constraints because he is at the South Pole and should only be able to move North.
4. The program would incorrectly process this and output 'YES' because it does not check for movement restrictions when at the poles for non-vertical travel (East/West).

Thus, the program fails to manage the conditions regarding movements allowed when at the North and South Pole and as such is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes an integer input `n` representing the number of journey parts, where each part includes a distance `t` and a direction `dir` that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". It calculates a cumulative latitude `curr_lat` starting from 90 degrees, adjusting it based on the distances for the specified directions. It only modifies `curr_lat` for "North" and "South" directions, while "West" and "East" directions are ignored. The function checks if `curr_lat` remains within the bounds of -90 to 90 degrees, printing 'NO' and exiting if it exceeds these limits or if it reaches the boundary values (-90 or 90) without the appropriate direction. After processing all journey parts, it prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` equals 90, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not handle invalid or malformed inputs, which could lead to exceptions if not controlled.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
