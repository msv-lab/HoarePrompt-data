To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program against the provided problem description, we need to assess whether it adheres to all specified requirements regarding Limak's journey.

**Key Conditions from the Problem Description:**
1. If Limak is at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude), he can only move South.
2. If Limak is at the South Pole (-90 degrees latitude), he can only move North.
3. The journey must end at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude).

**Program Review:**
1. The program initializes `curr_lat` to 90 degrees, representing the North Pole.
2. It reads `n` directions and distances, iterating through each instruction.
3. Based on the direction (`North`, `South`, `West`, `East`), it updates `curr_lat`:
   - `North`: increases latitude (which is incorrect because it should not be possible at 90 degrees).
   - `South`: decreases latitude (correct).
   - `West` and `East`: do not affect latitude, which is fine.
4. Each iteration checks whether the latitude exceeds the acceptable bounds (-90 to 90). If it does, it prints `'NO'` and exits.
5. It correctly verifies that if Limak is at 90 degrees, moving `South` should be enforced. If he is at -90 degrees, only movement `North` is allowed.
6. Finally, it checks if `curr_lat` is 90 degrees at the end of the journey to print `'YES'` or `'NO'`.

**Issue Identification:**
- The program allows Limak to move `North` even when he is at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude). This is incorrect according to the problem statement, where moving `North` from the North Pole is not allowed (it should effectively prevent any movement up from 90).
- Therefore, there are scenarios where the journey could report `'YES'`, even though Limak might have moved `North` incorrectly, violating the rules set out.

**Conclusion:**
The program incorrectly handles the conditions for movement at the North Pole by allowing `North` movement, which is against the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
