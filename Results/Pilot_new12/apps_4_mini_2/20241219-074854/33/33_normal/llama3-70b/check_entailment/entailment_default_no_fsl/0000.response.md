Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not adequately handle the "West" and "East" movements, which are to be ignored according to the problem description. However, it fails to account for scenarios where moving "South" or "North" is not possible, specifically when the position (latitude) is at either the North or South Pole.

For instance, if the input is:

```
2
15000 South
4000 East
```

In this scenario, Limak moves 15000 kilometers South, which is fine, but the subsequent movement of 4000 kilometers East is irrelevant because East movement does not change latitude. After the first movement, Limak does not check if he can still move further or if he ends his journey correctly at the North Pole. The program should handle that all directions which do not change latitude should lead to an immediate "NO" if made after reaching the bounds at -90 or 90.

Moreover, even though the program ignores "West" and "East" within the loop correctly, the logic should ensure any movement other than directional North or South immediately makes the journey invalid. Thus, the journey that contains invalid movements after reaching the poles needs to be caught explicitly.

The output should conform to the requirements strictly as outlined, maintaining "YES" or "NO" in relation to completion at the North Pole and compliance with direction constraints at the poles. The failure to impose this restricts the code from functioning correctly for all potential edge cases.
