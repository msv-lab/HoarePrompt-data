Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle all necessary conditions as specified in the problem description. Here is a potential test case that demonstrates this:

Consider the following input:

```
4
20000 South
1000 East
20000 North
1000 North
```

In this scenario:
1. Limak starts at the North Pole (90°).
2. He moves 20,000 kilometers South, which would place him at latitude -90° (the South Pole).
3. Next, he attempts to move 1,000 kilometers East. This is not allowed as per the constraints because he is at the South Pole and should only be able to move North.
4. The program would incorrectly process this and output 'YES' because it does not check for movement restrictions when at the poles for non-vertical travel (East/West).

Thus, the program fails to manage the conditions regarding movements allowed when at the North and South Pole and as such is incorrect.
