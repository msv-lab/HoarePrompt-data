Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Boundary Movement Restrictions**: 
   - The program does check if Limak is at the North or South Pole, but it does not properly enforce the movement restrictions. Specifically, if Limak is at the North Pole (curr_lat == 90), he must not move in any direction other than South. The program does check that if `curr_lat` is 90, the direction must be 'South' (which is a correct condition), but it only verifies that after he has moved South, rather than stopping him from trying to move North in the first place.

2. **Latitude Calculation**: 
   - The latitude adjustments are made using a conversion factor (t / 111.195), which is based on kilometers to degrees of latitude. This part may cause the `curr_lat` to incorrectly exceed the specified latitude bounds if large distances are added or subtracted, but this is less of a primary concern than the movement restrictions.

3. **Ignoring North/South Directions**: 
   - The `else: continue` statement means that if Limak moves East or West, no latitude change occurs and the program does not check any of the boundary conditions related to these actions. However, in the context of the problem description, these moves should not be allowed at the poles. Specifically, if Limak tries to move East or West while at the North Pole or South Pole, that situation should lead to an invalid journey.

4. **End Journey Condition**: 
   - The function prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` equals 90 after all movements, which is correct. Still, if the journey has included invalid moves or movements that violate the pole restrictions throughout the journey, reaching `curr_lat == 90` alone is not sufficient to determine whether Limak's journey description was valid.

Given these issues, the program does not adhere to the problem's conditions effectively for all cases. Therefore, the result is "NO", which indicates that the journey described may not be valid under the described constraints. 

In summary, the program fails to adequately handle the rules for movements when at the North or South Pole and does not enforce the specified movement direction restrictions strictly.
