You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze it based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The conditions that need to be satisfied in the journey are:
1. If Limak is at the North Pole (latitude = 90), he can only move South.
2. If Limak is at the South Pole (latitude = -90), he can only move North.
3. The journey must end at the North Pole (latitude = 90).

### Program Analysis

The implemented function is as follows:

- It starts by setting `curr_lat` to 90 (for North Pole).
- For each direction and distance, it adjusts `curr_lat` accordingly.
- It checks that `curr_lat` does not exceed the bounds of -90 to 90.
- If `curr_lat` is either -90 or 90, it checks that Limak does not move in a forbidden direction (if at North, he can only go South; if at South, he can only go North).
- Finally, after processing all directions, it checks if Limak ended up back at the North Pole.

### Edge Case Consideration

Here, I will illustrate a potential edge case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
20000 South
20000 South
40000 North
```

This input specifies:
1. Move 20000 km South (now at 0 latitude).
2. Move another 20000 km South (now at -20000 km latitude, which is invalid since it exceeds -90).
3. Move 40000 km North (but this would not help as Limak already broke the boundary in the 2nd step).

In this situation, even though the program checks if `curr_lat` goes out of bounds, let's specifically analyze how it handles the direction allowed at the poles:

The program won't terminate on the second command (which pushes the latitude invalidly) because it would not detect the violation until the third command. However, since the second command leads Limak out of bounds, the program would ultimately return "NO".

**Conclusion**

After considering various input cases, I've concluded that while the program does check directions at the poles and enforce bounds adequately, it might miss the opportunity to reject a series of commands before reaching a final invalid state especially through compounding movements. However, for the inputs provided in the examples, the logic does function as expected.

Therefore, while the program has its checks in place and works correctly for the examples, the edge cases identified show it may have flaws in complex chains of directions leading to invalid states not adequately caught in sequence.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be considered:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and for each part of the journey described by an integer t_i (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) and a string dir_i which is one of {"North", "South", "West", "East"}.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is a latitude value that may change based on the inputs 't' and 'dir' received during the loop iterations, remaining within the bounds of -90 and 90. If `curr_lat` exceeds these bounds, 'NO' is printed, and the program exits. If `curr_lat` is 90, the last valid direction must be 'South' to avoid printing 'NO' and exiting. If `curr_lat` is -90, the last valid direction must be 'North' for the same reason. The values of 't' and 'dir' are determined by user input during each iteration of the loop.
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer input `n` representing the number of journey parts, where each part includes a distance `t` and a direction `dir` that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". It calculates a cumulative latitude `curr_lat` starting from 90 degrees, adjusting it based on the distances for the specified directions. It only modifies `curr_lat` for "North" and "South" directions, while "West" and "East" directions are ignored. The function checks if `curr_lat` remains within the bounds of -90 to 90 degrees, printing 'NO' and exiting if it exceeds these limits or if it reaches the boundary values (-90 or 90) without the appropriate direction. After processing all journey parts, it prints 'YES' if `curr_lat` equals 90, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not handle invalid or malformed inputs, which could lead to exceptions if not controlled.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
