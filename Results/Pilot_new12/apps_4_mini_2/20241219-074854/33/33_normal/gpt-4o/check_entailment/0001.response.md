Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not properly address the movement limitations while at the North Pole or South Pole.

Here is an example that highlights one of the errors:

Example Input:
```
2
20000 South
20000 North
```

Expected Output: "YES" (because Limak first moves to the South Pole and then returns to the North Pole).

Actual Output of the program: "NO".

In this case, the program incorrectly evaluates the movement from South Pole to North Pole because it fails to check movement constraints correctly when Limak is at the poles.

Additionally, the program also has an issue with not allowing for movement North from any position at or above 20000 with smaller `t` values. This could lead to other invalid evaluations for various journey plans.

These issues make the correctness of the implementation False with respect to the problem description.
