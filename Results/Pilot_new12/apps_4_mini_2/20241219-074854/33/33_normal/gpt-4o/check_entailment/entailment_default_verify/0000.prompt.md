You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole. [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
    if position != 0:
        valid = False
    if valid:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided program is correct based on the problem description, let's analyze the code against potential edge cases and the rules specified.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. If Limak is at the North Pole (`position == 0`), he can only move South.
2. If Limak is at the South Pole (`position == 20000`), he can only move North.
3. The journey must end at the North Pole (`position == 0`).

### Code Walkthrough:

1. **Initialization**: The position is set to `0` (North Pole) and `valid` is initialized to `True`.
2. **Input Handling**: Each direction and distance are read, and the position changes based on the direction:
   - Moving North decreases the position.
   - Moving South increases the position.
   - Moving East or West does not alter the position.
3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - If moving North would result in a position less than `0`, it's invalid.
   - If moving South would exceed `20000`, it's invalid.
   - If Limak is at either pole, East or West movement is invalid.
4. **Final Check**: After processing all moves, it checks if Limak ends up at the North Pole (position `0`).

### Potential Flaws/Edge Cases:
1. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - If Limak starts at the North Pole (position `0`) and receives a command to move North, which should be disallowed, the code handles this as it checks `position - t < 0`.
   - If Limak starts at the South Pole (position `20000`) and receives a command to move South, which should be disallowed, it checks with `position + t > 20000`.

2. **Immediate Rejection**:
   - If any command is invalid based on the current position, it correctly sets `valid` to `False`.

3. **Ending Condition**: The final position is checked to ensure it returns to the North Pole.

### Test Cases:
- From the provided examples, the logic correctly identifies movements according to the stated rules:
  - Cases where Limak cannot move in a certain direction from a pole correctly yield `NO`.
  - Various sequences where he returns to the North Pole validate the logic as well.

### Edge Case Discovery:
While going through these computations, if we have a sequence where Limak tries to take an invalid step when further along his journey and effectively ends with non-pole positions (such as 4000 North after doing South moves), we note that all checks are conducted at each command, which prevents bad sequences.

The program logic appears sound, consistently checking the position against the movement constraints and final outcome.

Conclusively, I could not find any potential failure cases per the spoken and clarified logic of the journey limitations based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a series of movement commands defined by a number of instructions, where each instruction consists of a distance and a direction. It validates each movement based on defined constraints such as not allowing the position to fall below 0 or exceed 20000, and also restricts certain movements when at boundaries (0 or 20000). At the end of the command series, if the final position is 0 and all movements were valid, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. It ensures that the movements comply with the constraints throughout the execution, but it does not track or return the final Cartesian coordinates, just a validity message. Also, there is no handling for invalid input directions, meaning if an unsupported direction is provided, the function does not explicitly handle that case.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
