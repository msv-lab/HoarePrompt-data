The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer conversion of `t`, which comes from input and is represented as a split value. Given that `t` is required to be an integer and is bounded by the input constraints, the change impacts only the `t` variable. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `t_i` is an integer with 1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is True, `_` is equal to `n`, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is from input as a split value.**
