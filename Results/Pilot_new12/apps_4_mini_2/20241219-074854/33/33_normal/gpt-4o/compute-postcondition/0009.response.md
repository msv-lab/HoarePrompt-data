Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t_i` is an integer (1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6); `dir_i` is a string that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East"; `position` is 0; `valid` is False; `t` is an input integer assigned the value of int(input()); `dir` is an input string equal to 'North'; if `position - t` is less than 0, it indicates that `position` is less than `t`.***
