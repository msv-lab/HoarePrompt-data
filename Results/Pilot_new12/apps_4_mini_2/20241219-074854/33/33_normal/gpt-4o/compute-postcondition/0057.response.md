Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input string; if `dir` is 'North', then `position` is updated to `position - t`. If `position - t < 0`, then `valid` is set to False; otherwise, `valid` remains unchanged. If `dir` is 'South', then `position` is updated to `position + t`. If `position + t` exceeds 20000, then `valid` is set to False. If `dir` is not 'South', `position` remains unchanged. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East' and `position` is either 0 or 20000, then `valid` is set to False.***
