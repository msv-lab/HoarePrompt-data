Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t_i` is a list of integers with 1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6; `position` is between 0 and 20000 inclusive. If `position` is not equal to 0, `valid` is set to False, indicating that not all movements were valid based on the defined conditions.***
