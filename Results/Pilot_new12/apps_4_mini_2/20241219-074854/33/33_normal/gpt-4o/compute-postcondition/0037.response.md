The `valid` variable is assigned the value `False`, indicating that the condition previously represented by `valid` is no longer met. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `t_i` is an integer with 1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is False, `_` is equal to `n`, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is from input as a split value.**
