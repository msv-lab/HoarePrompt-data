Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t_i` is an integer with 1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6; if `dir` is 'North', then `position` is a negative value equal to `0 - t`, `valid` is now True, and `t` is an input integer; if `dir` is 'South', then `position` is equal to `t` and `valid` is now True; if `dir` is 'West' or 'East', then `position` is either 0 or 20000 and `valid` is now True; if `dir` is none of these, then `position` remains either 0 or 20000 and `valid` retains its original value of True. The current value of `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000.**
