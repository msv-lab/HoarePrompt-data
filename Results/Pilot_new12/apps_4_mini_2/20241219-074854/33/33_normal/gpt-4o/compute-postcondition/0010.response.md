The value of `position` is decremented by `t`. The value of `position` is initially 0, and since `t` is an input integer, it is positive and also must be less than or equal to 10^6. Thus, `position - t` will always be negative, confirming that `position` becomes negative after the operation.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected; `n`, `t_i`, `dir_i`, `valid`, and `dir` do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t_i` is an integer (1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6); `dir_i` is a string that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East"; `position` is a negative value equal to `0 - t`; `valid` is False; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input string equal to 'North'.**
