Functionality: **The function reads a series of movement commands defined by a number of instructions, where each instruction consists of a distance and a direction. It validates each movement based on defined constraints such as not allowing the position to fall below 0 or exceed 20000, and also restricts certain movements when at boundaries (0 or 20000). At the end of the command series, if the final position is 0 and all movements were valid, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. It ensures that the movements comply with the constraints throughout the execution, but it does not track or return the final Cartesian coordinates, just a validity message. Also, there is no handling for invalid input directions, meaning if an unsupported direction is provided, the function does not explicitly handle that case.**
