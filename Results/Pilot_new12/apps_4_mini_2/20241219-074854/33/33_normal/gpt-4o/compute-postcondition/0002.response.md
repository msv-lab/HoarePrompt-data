`valid` is assigned the value `True`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state remains consistent with the initial values except for the updated `valid`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `t_i` is an integer (1 <= t_i <= 10^6); `dir_i` is a string that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East"; `position` is 0; `valid` is True**.
