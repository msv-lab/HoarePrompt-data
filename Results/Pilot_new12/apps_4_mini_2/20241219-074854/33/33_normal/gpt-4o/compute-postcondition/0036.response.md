The value of `position` is incremented by `t`. Given that `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, and that the condition `position + t > 20000` is satisfied, the resulting value of `position` after this operation will be greater than 20000. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `t_i` is an integer with 1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6, `position` is greater than 20000, `valid` is False, `_` is equal to `n`, and `t` is an input integer, `position` is increased by `t`.**
