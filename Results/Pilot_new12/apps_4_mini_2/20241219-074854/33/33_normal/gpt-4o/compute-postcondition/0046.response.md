The value of `t` is converted to an integer, but since `t` is already assigned as an input integer from the initial state, its value does not change. The states of the other variables are unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input string; `position` remains unchanged; `_` is equal to `n + 1**
