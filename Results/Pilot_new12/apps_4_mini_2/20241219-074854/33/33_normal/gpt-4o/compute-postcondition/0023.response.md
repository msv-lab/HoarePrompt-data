Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t_i` is an integer (1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6); if `dir` is "South", then `position` is equal to `t` and `valid` is False. If `dir` is not "South" and is either "West" or "East", then `position` is either 0 or 20000 and `valid` is set to False; otherwise, `position` remains either 0 or 20000 and `valid` retains its original value of True.***
