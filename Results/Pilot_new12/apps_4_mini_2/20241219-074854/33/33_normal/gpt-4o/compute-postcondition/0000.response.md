The value of `n` is assigned from the result of `int(input())`, where `input()` will take an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` must still satisfy the original condition of being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50. The values of `t_i` and `dir_i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. So all previous conditions still hold.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `t_i` is an integer (1 <= t_i <= 10^6); `dir_i` is a string that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East"; `n` is now assigned the integer value from input.**
