Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t_i` is an integer (1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6); `dir_i` is a string that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East"; `position` is 0; `valid` is False; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input string that is not equal to 'North' and is currently 'South'. If `position + t` exceeds 20000, `valid` is set to False; otherwise, there is no else part to modify the state.***
