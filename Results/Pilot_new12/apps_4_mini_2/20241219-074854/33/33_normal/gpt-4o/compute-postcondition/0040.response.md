Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `t_i` is an integer with 1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6, and `_` is equal to `n`. If `dir` is 'South' and `position` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is set to False, and `position` is increased by `t`. If `dir` is not 'South', then `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is set to False, and if `dir` is 'West' or 'East' with `position` being either 0 or 20000, `valid` remains False; otherwise, there is no additional change to `valid` or `position`.***
