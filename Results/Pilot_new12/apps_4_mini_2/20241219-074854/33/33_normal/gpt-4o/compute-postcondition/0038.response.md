Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `t_i` is an integer with 1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is set to False, `_` is equal to `n`, `t` is an input integer, and `dir` is from input as a split value, if `position` is either 0 or 20000.***
