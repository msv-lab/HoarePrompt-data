Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t_i` is an integer with 1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, then `valid` is now True, and `position` could be updated based on the value of `dir`: if `dir` is 'North', then `position` becomes a negative value equal to `0 - t`; if `dir` is 'South', then `position` equals `t`; if `dir` is 'West' or 'East', `position` can be either 0 or 20000; if `dir` is none of these, `position` remains either 0 or 20000 and `valid` retains its original value of True.***
