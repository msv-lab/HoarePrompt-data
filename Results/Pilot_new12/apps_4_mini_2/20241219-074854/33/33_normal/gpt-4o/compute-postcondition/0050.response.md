The variable `valid` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `dir`, `position`, and `_`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input string; `position` remains unchanged; `_` is equal to `n + 1; `valid` is False.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input string; `position` remains unchanged; `_` is equal to `n + 1; `valid` is False.**
