Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input string. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, then `valid` is set to False and `position` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `position` is updated based on the direction and the value of `t`, while `valid` may change depending on the limits set by the conditions for 'North' and 'South', but remains unchanged for other directions unless `position` is 0 or 20000 with 'West' or 'East'.***
