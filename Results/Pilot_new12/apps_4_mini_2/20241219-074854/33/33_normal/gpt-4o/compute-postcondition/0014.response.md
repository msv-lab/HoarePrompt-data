The variable `valid` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State incorporates the updated value of `valid` while retaining all relevant conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t_i` is an integer (1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6); `dir_i` is a string that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East"; `position` is 0; `valid` is False; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input string that is not equal to 'North' and is currently 'South'; the current value of `position + t` is greater than 20000.**
