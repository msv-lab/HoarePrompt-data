The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it processes a series of instructions defined by two collections: a list of integers `t` representing the number of steps in each instruction and a corresponding list of strings `dir` indicating the direction of each instruction ("North", "South", "West", or "East"). The function returns a final position as a tuple of two integers, representing the net displacement from the origin in the Cartesian coordinate system based on the given instructions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of instructions about steps and directions, returning the final position as a tuple representing net displacement in the Cartesian coordinate system based on the provided moves.**
