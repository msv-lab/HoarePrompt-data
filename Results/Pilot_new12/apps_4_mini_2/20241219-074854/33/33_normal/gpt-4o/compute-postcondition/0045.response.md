The code snippet shown is reading input via the `input()` function and then splitting that input into two variables, `t` and `dir`. The values assigned to `t` and `dir` will depend on the actual input provided, which is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `t` is assigned from the input, it will be an integer (based on the context of the variable names and typical usage), but without a specific input given, we cannot definitively state its value. Similarly, `dir` will be a string from the input but we do not know its exact content.

Therefore, the impact on the program is that `t` now holds a value from the input and `dir` holds a string value from the input. All other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input string; `position` remains unchanged; `_` is equal to `n + 1`**
