According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs for a range of `n`, so for it to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, and since `_` indicates the current iteration of the loop, we know it was the last iteration. To execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, meaning the next value of `_` would be `n + 1`, and thus `n` must remain unchanged and be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `t_i` is an integer with 1 <= `t_i` <= 10^6; `position` remains unchanged; `_` is equal to `n + 1`**
