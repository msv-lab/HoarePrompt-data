Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is the maximum length of consecutive subarrays satisfying the condition `a[k] - a[i] = k - i` for all valid indices `i` and `j` with `0 <= i < n` and `i < j <= n`.**
