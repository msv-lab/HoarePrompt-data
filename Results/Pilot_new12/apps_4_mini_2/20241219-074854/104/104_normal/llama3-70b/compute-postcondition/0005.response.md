Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. The integers in list `a` from index `i` to `j-1` are consecutive, such that the difference between each successive element and `a[i]` is equal to the difference in their respective indices from `i` to `j-1`.***
