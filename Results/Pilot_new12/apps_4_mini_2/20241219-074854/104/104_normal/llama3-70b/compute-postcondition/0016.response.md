According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will start with `j` equal to 2 (since `1 + 1 = 2`) and will continue iterating while `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 (because if `n` is 1, `j` would start at 2 and terminate immediately without executing the loop). Therefore, we need to adjust the conditions as follows:

1. `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute at least once.
2. The initial value of `j` will be 2 when the loop starts.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_erase` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of n integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`**
