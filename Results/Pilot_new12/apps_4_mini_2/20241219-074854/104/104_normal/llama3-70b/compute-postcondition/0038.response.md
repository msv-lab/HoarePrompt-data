Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is the maximum length of consecutive subarrays satisfying the condition `a[k] - a[i] = k - i` for all `k` in the range from `i` to `n`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and if the loop does not execute, `max_erase` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
