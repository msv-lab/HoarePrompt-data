`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over a new input of space-separated integers. While `n` is a new input integer, its value determines the number of elements in `a`, but we don't know the specific values generated from the input for `a`. Therefore, the value of `a` changes to a list of integers based on the new input.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer where `1 <= n <= 100`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from the new input, where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`.**
