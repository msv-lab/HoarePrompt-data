Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers satisfying the condition `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds true, then `max_erase` is set to 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is 3.***
