Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `max_erase` remains unchanged, if the condition holds true where the difference between `a[k]` and `a[i]` equals the difference between `k` and `i` for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, then `max_erase` will be updated to the maximum value between its previous value and 0.***
