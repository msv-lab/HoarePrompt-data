Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_erase` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`. The current values of `a[i]` and `a[j]` are such that the difference between `a[k]` and `a[i]` is equal to the difference between `k` and `i` for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, meaning that the elements of `a` from index `i` to `j` form a consecutive sequence.***
