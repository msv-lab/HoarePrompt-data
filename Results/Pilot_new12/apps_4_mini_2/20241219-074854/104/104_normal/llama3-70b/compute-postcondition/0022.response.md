Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and the condition that all differences `a[k] - a[i]` equals `k - i` holds for `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, then `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1. If the condition does not hold, there are no changes made (no else part is defined).***
