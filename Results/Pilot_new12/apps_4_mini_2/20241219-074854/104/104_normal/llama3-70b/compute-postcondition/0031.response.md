Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `j - n - 1` if for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, the difference `a[k] - a[i]` is equal to `k - i`. If the condition is not satisfied, `max_erase` remains unchanged. Also, `i` is always equal to `n`.***
