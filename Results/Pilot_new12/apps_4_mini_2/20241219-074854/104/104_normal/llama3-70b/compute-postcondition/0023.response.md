According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The for loop iterates over `j`, starting from `i + 1` up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increase by 1. Since `j` is currently 3, it will become 4 in the next iteration. The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the next state will assume `n` is at least 4 to ensure the loop can continue executing.

Therefore, for `j` to be 4, the state will be adjusted as follows:
State: **If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4**
