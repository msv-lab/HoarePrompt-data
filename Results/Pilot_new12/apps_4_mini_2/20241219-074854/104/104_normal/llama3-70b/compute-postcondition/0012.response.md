To determine the output state after executing the given code, we analyze the code snippet:

`max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)`

In this scenario:
- `max_erase` is initially `1`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `j` is `3`.

Now, evaluating `j - i - 1`:
- Substitute the values: `j - i - 1 = 3 - 0 - 1 = 2`.

Next, we find the maximum between `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`:
- `max(max_erase, j - i - 1) = max(1, 2)`, which equals `2`.

Thus, `max_erase` is updated to `2`. 

The other variables remain unchanged, and we will summarize the existing state and updated value as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, max_erase` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**.
