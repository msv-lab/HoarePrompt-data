According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subarray starting from index `i`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `n + 1`.**
