According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index in the range and is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it `n + 1`, which means that the loop will not execute again since `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to run.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows: `i` will become `n + 1`, and there will be no change to `n` or `a` since they won't affect the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is the maximum length of consecutive subarray starting from index `1` where the elements satisfy the condition of `a[k] - a[i] = k - i`, for all `k` in the range from `1` to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`**.
