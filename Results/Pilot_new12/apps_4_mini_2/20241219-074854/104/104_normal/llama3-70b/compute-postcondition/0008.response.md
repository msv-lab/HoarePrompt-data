According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. In this case, `i` is also 0. The loop will execute again as long as `j` (which will be incremented) remains less than or equal to `n`. 

The next value for `j` will be 2, since the loop starts at `j = i + 1`, where `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 (greater than or equal to the new value of `j`).

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
