Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `i` must be less than `n`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`. If all elements from `a[i]` to `a[n]` are consecutive integers, `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `n - i`. Otherwise, there is no change to `max_erase`.***
