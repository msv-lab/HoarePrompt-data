The expression `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` updates `max_erase` by comparing its current value with the result of `j - i - 1`. Given that `j` is `1` and `i` is `0`, we calculate `j - i - 1` which gives us `1 - 0 - 1 = 0`. 

The `max` function will compare `max_erase` (which is `0`) and `0`. Therefore, the value of `max_erase` remains unchanged at `0`. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
