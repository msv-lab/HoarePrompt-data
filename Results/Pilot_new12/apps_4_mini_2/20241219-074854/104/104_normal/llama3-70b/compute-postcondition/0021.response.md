To analyze the code snippet given the initial state, let's go through it step by step. 

The initial values are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `max_erase` remains unchanged

The code executed is:
```
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```

1. We first calculate `j - i - 1`:
   - `j` is 3 and `i` is 1, so `j - i - 1` equals `3 - 1 - 1` which is `1`.
  
2. The `max` function compares `max_erase` with the result of `j - i - 1`:
   - The new value of `max_erase` will be the maximum of its current value (which is unchanged in this context and thus unknown but follows "remains unchanged") and `1`.

The output state will reflect that `max_erase` is now either its previous value or, if it was less than `1`, it is updated to `1`.

Since `max_erase` remains unchanged, we do not know the exact value, but let's denote it as `max_erase_previous` to clarify that the variable's derived output does not affect others.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 1; `j` is 3; `max_erase` is max(max_erase_previous, 1)**.
