The code `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)` updates the value of `max_erase`. The value of `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and since `i` is less than `n`, the expression `j - i - 1` can be simplified.

- Given that `j = n + 1`, we have:
  \[
  j - i - 1 = (n + 1) - i - 1 = n - i
  \]

- Therefore, the expression for `max_erase` becomes:
  \[
  max_erase = max(max_erase, n - i)
  \]

The states of the other variables `n`, `a`, `i`, and the unchanged value of `max_erase` from before remain valid.


Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `i` must be less than `n`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `max_erase` is updated to max(max_erase, n - i)**
