The `max_erase` is assigned the greater value between its current value and `j - i - 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `j` is 4, we can evaluate `j - i - 1`:

1. Calculate `j - i - 1`:
   - `j` is 4
   - `i` is 1
   - Thus, `j - i - 1` = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2.

Now, `max_erase` will be updated as follows:
- `max_erase` = `max(max_erase, 2)`.

Since we do not have the initial value of `max_erase`, we cannot determine its new value, but we know that it will either remain the same or increase to 2.

The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `max_erase` is updated to `max(max_erase, 2)`**.
