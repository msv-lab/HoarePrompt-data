Initial State: `n` is a new input integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0.

Analyzing the loop code, we understand that it iterates through `j` from `i + 1` to `n + 1`, and checks if the elements of `a` from index `i` to `j - 1` form a consecutive sequence. If they do, it updates `max_erase` to be the maximum between its current value and the length of that sequence minus 1.

After all iterations of the loop:
- `max_erase` will hold the maximum length of any consecutive subarray formed starting from the index `i`.
- `i` remains unchanged as the loop relies on the original value.
- `j` will equal to `n + 1` as it runs until that value.

If the loop did not execute because `n <= 1`, then `max_erase` remains 0 as its initial value, and `i` remains 0, while `j` reaches the value of 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is the maximum length of a consecutive subarray starting from index `i`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `n + 1`.**
