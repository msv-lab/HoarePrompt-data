According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop begins at `i + 1`, which is 2, and continues until `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, the starting value of `j` is 2, and the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is at least 2, the maximum value for `j` can be as high as 3 (if `n` equals 2), allowing the loop to run again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `i` is still 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. For the loop to still be valid, `n` must be at least 3 to ensure `j` does not exceed `n + 1`, which is 4 when `n` equals 3.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we conclude:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `max_erase` remains unchanged**.
