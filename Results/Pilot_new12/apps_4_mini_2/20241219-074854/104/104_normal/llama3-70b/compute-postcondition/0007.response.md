Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. If all integers in `a` from index `i` to `j-1` form a consecutive sequence such that each integer's value minus its index equals the difference between the value at index `i` and `i`, then the condition holds true for those indices; otherwise, the condition does not hold.***
