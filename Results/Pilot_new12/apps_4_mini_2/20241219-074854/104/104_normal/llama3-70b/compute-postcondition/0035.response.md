According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` and goes up to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the next value of `j` will be `n + 1` (as `j` is initialized to `i + 1`, which was `n + 1`). 

Since `j` starts at `n + 1`, the loop will execute one last time only if `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. However, as soon as `j` reaches `n + 1`, the loop will not execute again because the range will be empty.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, allowing `j` to reach a value less than or equal to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `i` must be less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `n + 1`.**
