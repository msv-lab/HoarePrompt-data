According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` ranging from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Since at the end of the last iteration, `i` is always equal to `n`, the next value of `j` will be `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `j` should be initialized to `n + 1` for the next iteration. However, since the loop only executes while `j` is less than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `n + 1`.

Since `j` is `n + 1` and `i` is `n`, the loop cannot execute again because `j` exceeds the valid range. The conditions for the loop state will satisfy the configuration:

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `n + 1`**
