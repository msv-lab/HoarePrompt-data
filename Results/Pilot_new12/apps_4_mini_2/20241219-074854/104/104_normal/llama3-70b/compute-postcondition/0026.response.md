Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is the maximum length of consecutive subarray starting from index `1` where the elements satisfy the condition of `a[k] - a[i] = k - i`, for all `k` in the range from `1` to `n`, and `j` is `n + 1`.**
