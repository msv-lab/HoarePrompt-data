Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is the maximum length of consecutive subarray starting from index `1`, `i` is equal to `n`, and for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`, the difference `a[k] - a[i]` is equal to `k - i`***
