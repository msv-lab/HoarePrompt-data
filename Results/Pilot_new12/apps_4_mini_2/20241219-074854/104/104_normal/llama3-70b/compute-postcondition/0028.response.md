According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which is initialized with the value of `i + 1` and iterates up to `n + 1`. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to `n + 1`. This means that the starting range for `j` becomes `range(n + 2, n + 1)`, which is an invalid range and results in the loop not executing as there are no valid values for `j`.

To enable the loop to execute, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `n + 1`, specifically, `i` should be `n`. This allows `j` to start from `n + 1` and iterate up to `n + 1`, which means the loop will execute for `j = n + 1`.

Additionally, `max_erase` is not relevant for the loop execution but should still be consistent with the given constraints on the values of `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, `max_erase` is the maximum length of consecutive subarray starting from index `1`, `i` must be equal to `n`**
