Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, if all integers in the range from `a[i]` to `a[j-1]` satisfy the conditions defined, then `max_erase` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 0, with `i` equal to `n` and `j` equal to `n + 1`.***
