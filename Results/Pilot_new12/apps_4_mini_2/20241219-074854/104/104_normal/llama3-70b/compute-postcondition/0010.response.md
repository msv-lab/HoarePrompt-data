Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where `1 <= n <= 100`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`. If the condition holds that all differences `a[k] - a[i]` for `k` in the range `i` to `j` equal their respective indices differences `k - i`, then `max_erase` is set to 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. Otherwise, the variables retain their original values.***
