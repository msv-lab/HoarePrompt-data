Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's an explanation of how it does so:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the array, and a list of integers `a` that is guaranteed to be strictly increasing and within the bounds given (1 to 1000).

2. **Core Logic**: The program calculates the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased by determining the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The way it does this is by calculating:
   - `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` for each pair of consecutive elements.
   This expression effectively counts how many integers exist between two consecutive elements, thus representing the maximum number of elements that could be erased while still allowing the array to be restored from the remaining elements.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If `n` is 1 (the smallest possible size for the array), there are no consecutive elements, and thus, `max_erase` remains 0, which correctly corresponds to the requirement to print `0` if it's impossible to erase any elements. 
   - The condition naturally takes care of arrays where elements are adjacent (e.g., [1, 2, 3, ...]), which would also lead to a correct calculation of the maximum erasures.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased, which meets the requirements of the problem description.

5. **Assumptions on Input Validity**: The problem states that valid input will be provided, and as such, the lack of additional error handling does not detract from the correctness of the program, as per the given assumptions.

In conclusion, the program successfully implements the logic needed to solve the problem as stated in the description, ensuring that all potential cases required by the problem description are correctly addressed.
