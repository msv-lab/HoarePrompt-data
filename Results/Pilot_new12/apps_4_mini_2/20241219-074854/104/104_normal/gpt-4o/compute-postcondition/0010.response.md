The code snippet provided simply prints the value of `max_erase`, which doesn't alter the state of any variables or perform any calculations. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged nature of the variables while confirming that `max_erase` can hold a specific positive integer value based on prior calculations.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `max_erase` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, with the value of max_erase printed.**
