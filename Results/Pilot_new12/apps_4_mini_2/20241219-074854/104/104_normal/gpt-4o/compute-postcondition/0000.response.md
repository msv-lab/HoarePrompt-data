The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is originally defined to be a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, this will remain valid unless an out-of-range value is provided as input. The other variables are not impacted.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of the input value provided (1 <= n <= 100), and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000.**
