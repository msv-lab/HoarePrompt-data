The variable `max_erase` is initialized to 0. The previous states of the other variables, `n` and `a`, remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers created from the input, where 1 <= `a[0]` < `a[1]` < ... < `a[n-1]` <= 1000; `max_erase` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers created from the input, where 1 <= `a[0]` < `a[1]` < ... < `a[n-1]` <= 1000; `max_erase` is 0.**
