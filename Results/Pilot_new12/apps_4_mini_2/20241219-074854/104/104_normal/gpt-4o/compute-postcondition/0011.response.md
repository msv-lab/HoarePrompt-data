The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where the elements satisfy the condition `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`. After executing the function body, it is specified that the function produces an output that adheres to the constraints of the input parameters. However, the exact details of the output are not provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and a list a of n integers (1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000), with no further specified return value from the provided information.**
