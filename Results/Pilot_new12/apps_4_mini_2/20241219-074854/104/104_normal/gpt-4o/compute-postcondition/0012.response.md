Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers that are strictly increasing and within the range of 1 to 1000. It calculates the maximum gap of consecutive elements in the list `a` that could be erased without affecting the order of the remaining elements. The result is the largest difference between adjacent elements in `a`, minus one. After the function completes, it prints this maximum gap, denoted as `max_erase`. The function does not explicitly return any value. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 1 (in which case there would be no gaps to calculate) and the function assumes valid input constraints without additional error handling for invalid input data.**
