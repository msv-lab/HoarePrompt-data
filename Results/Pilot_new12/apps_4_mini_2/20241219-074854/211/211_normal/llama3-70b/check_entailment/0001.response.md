Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains all zero elements. According to the problem description, if all elements in the array sum to zero, the output should be "NO". 

For instance, if the input is:
```
3
0 0 0
```
The prefix sum `prefix_sum[n]` will be `0`, and the program will correctly print "NO", which is expected.

However, the program fails when there are a combination of positive and negative elements that sum to zero but can be split into non-zero sum subarrays. Let's illustrate this with an example:

Input:
```
4
1 -1 1 -1
```

In this case, the cumulative prefix sums would be:
- `prefix_sum[1] = 1`
- `prefix_sum[2] = 0`
- `prefix_sum[3] = 1`
- `prefix_sum[4] = 0`

While this array can be split into non-zero subarrays (e.g., [1] and [-1, 1, -1]), the current logic does not handle such scenarios correctly and would return incorrect bounds or may miss finding a valid split.

Hence, since the program fails to account for potential splits resulting in non-zero sums for arrays that still result in a total of zero, the correctness is **False**.
