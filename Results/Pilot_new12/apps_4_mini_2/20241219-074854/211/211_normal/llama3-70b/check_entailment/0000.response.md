To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code in relation to the requirements.

The problem states that we need to split the array into several parts such that the sum of elements in each part is not zero. If it is not possible to satisfy this requirement, we should print "NO". 

Here are some key points to consider when reviewing the program:

1. **Checking for Total Sum of Zero**: The program starts by calculating the prefix sums and checks if the total sum of the array (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero. If it is, the output is "NO", which is correct according to the requirements since we cannot split an array that sums to zero into non-zero parts.

2. **Finding Valid Splits**: The program aims to identify valid splits when the total sum is not zero. It loops through the prefix sums and prints a split when the prefix sum at some point is non-zero and does not equal the total sum. The logic here seems flawed. While the intention is to find segments whose sums are not zero, it's not guaranteed that simply checking for non-zero prefix sums will yield valid segments.

### Potential Edge Case:
Consider the following input:
```
5
1 2 3 -6
```
The total sum of the array is `1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = 0`. According to the program, it will print "NO", which is correct, but if we modify it slightly to:
```
5
1 2 3 -5
```
The total sum is `1 + 2 + 3 - 5 = 1`, which is non-zero. The program would output "YES", but it might incorrectly split the array. The way segments are computed could lead to mistakes, as it merely checks prefix sums without ensuring the sums of the respective segments are non-zero.

### Conclusion:
Due to this flawed logic in determining valid splits, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all potential cases. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem requirements in certain scenarios, especially in cases with specific configurations of positive and negative numbers that might lead to zero as a sum across segments. 

Correctness: **False**.
