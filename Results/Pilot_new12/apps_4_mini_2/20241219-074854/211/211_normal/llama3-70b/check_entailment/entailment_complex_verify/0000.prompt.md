You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        k = 1

        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
        print(k, l, n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code in relation to the requirements.

The problem states that we need to split the array into several parts such that the sum of elements in each part is not zero. If it is not possible to satisfy this requirement, we should print "NO". 

Here are some key points to consider when reviewing the program:

1. **Checking for Total Sum of Zero**: The program starts by calculating the prefix sums and checks if the total sum of the array (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero. If it is, the output is "NO", which is correct according to the requirements since we cannot split an array that sums to zero into non-zero parts.

2. **Finding Valid Splits**: The program aims to identify valid splits when the total sum is not zero. It loops through the prefix sums and prints a split when the prefix sum at some point is non-zero and does not equal the total sum. The logic here seems flawed. While the intention is to find segments whose sums are not zero, it's not guaranteed that simply checking for non-zero prefix sums will yield valid segments.

### Potential Edge Case:
Consider the following input:
```
5
1 2 3 -6
```
The total sum of the array is `1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = 0`. According to the program, it will print "NO", which is correct, but if we modify it slightly to:
```
5
1 2 3 -5
```
The total sum is `1 + 2 + 3 - 5 = 1`, which is non-zero. The program would output "YES", but it might incorrectly split the array. The way segments are computed could lead to mistakes, as it merely checks prefix sums without ensuring the sums of the respective segments are non-zero.

### Conclusion:
Due to this flawed logic in determining valid splits, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all potential cases. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem requirements in certain scenarios, especially in cases with specific configurations of positive and negative numbers that might lead to zero as a sum across segments. 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array A, and A is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[j]` is equal to the sum of the first `j` elements of the list `a` for `j` in the range [0, n]. If the loop does not execute (if `n` is 0), `prefix_sum` remains a list of length 1 filled with zero.
    if (prefix_sum[n] == 0) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 1
        l = 1
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]:
                print(k, l, r)
                k += 1
                l = r
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is the count of valid `r` values found plus 1, `l` is equal to the last valid `r` where `prefix_sum[r]` was updated, if loop executed; if loop did not execute, `k` remains 1, `l` remains 1.
        print(k, l, n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). If `prefix_sum[n]` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, `k` is set to 1 and `l` is set to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes an input integer `n` that determines the number of elements in an integer list `A`. It computes the prefix sums for the elements of `A` and checks if the total sum of the elements (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero. If the sum is zero, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES' followed by a sequence of indices. The function then identifies valid indices `r` where the prefix sum is neither zero nor equal to the total sum, and it outputs the count of these indices along with the last valid `l` and the total count `n`. If `n` is 0, it defaults to an output indicating no valid sums. The function also effectively handles the maximum and minimum constraints on the input values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
