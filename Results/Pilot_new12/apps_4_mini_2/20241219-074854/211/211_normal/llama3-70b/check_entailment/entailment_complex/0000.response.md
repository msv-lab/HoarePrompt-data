The provided program attempts to split an array into several parts such that the sum of the elements in each new array is not zero, which aligns with the problem description. Let's analyze the critical parts of the implementation to determine its correctness.

### Breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads an integer `n` followed by a list of integers `a` with length `n`. This aligns with the input requirements of the problem description.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates a prefix sum for the array `A`. This means it retains the cumulative sum of elements from the start of the array to each index, which is useful for determining subarray sums quickly.

3. **Zero Check**:
   - The program first checks if the total sum of the array (`prefix_sum[n]`) is zero. If it is zero, it prints "NO". This is correct because if the total sum is zero, it is impossible to split the array into non-zero subarrays.

4. **Identifying Subarrays**:
   - If the total sum is not zero, the program prints "YES" and initializes the counter `k` for the number of subarrays and `l` for the start index of the current subarray.
   - It iterates through the prefix sum to find valid end indices `r` where the prefix sum does not equal zero and does not equal the total sum. The indices where these conditions are met define the end of a valid subarray.

5. **Output the Results**:
   - At the end of the loop, the program adds one last entry from the last valid `l` to the total length `n`, which corresponds to the entire array as a subarray when necessary.
   - It outputs `k`, `l`, and `n`, accurately reflecting the indices of the formed subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately follows the requirements of the problem description. It checks for the impossibility of splitting when the total sum is zero and implements logic to create non-zero subarrays properly. 

The critical condition that every identified subarray must not have a sum of zero is well-accounted for, given that the only time we have a potential zero-sum subarray is when either the entire array is zero or specific sections that would reduce the total cumulative sum to zero.

Hence, we conclude that the program is correctly designed to meet the problem description for all valid inputs described:

Correctness: **True**
