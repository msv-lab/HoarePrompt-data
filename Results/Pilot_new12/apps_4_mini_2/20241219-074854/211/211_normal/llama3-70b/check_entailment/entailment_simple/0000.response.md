Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Output of Subarrays**: 
   - The requirement is to provide subarrays such that the sum of each is not zero. However, the program does not guarantee that the ranges it prints (l_i, r_i) correspond to subarrays whose sums are non-zero. In fact, it stops printing ranges if it encounters non-zero prefix sums which may lead to some subarrays being printed that have zero sums.

2. **Incorrect Counting and Output**:
   - The program initializes `k = 1`, which creates an off-by-one error in determining how many valid subarrays are formed. At the end of the loop, when it outputs `print(k, l, n)`, it might not accurately reflect the number of non-zero sum subarrays leading to incorrect output.

3. **Final Subarray Handling**: 
   - The final subarray output `print(k, l, n)` might print ranges that do not correspond to a valid division as per the given conditions. There might be cases where intermediate sums are zero and interrupt subarray formation.

Overall, the program does not consistently resolve the problem conditions as outlined in the problem description, particularly regarding the splitting of the array into parts that have a non-zero sum. In specific cases (especially those with interspersed zeros), it could print valid output while failing to comply with the sum condition, which means it does not guarantee correctness. Hence, the conclusion is that the implementation is flawed and does not fully comply with the requirements.
