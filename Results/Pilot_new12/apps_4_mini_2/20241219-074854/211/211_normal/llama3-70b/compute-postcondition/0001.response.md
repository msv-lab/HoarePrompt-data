In this scenario, `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping integers to the inputs received from a split string input. The variable `n` has a specific valid range (1 to 100), but its specific value is not stated. The result of the input will affect the list `a`, which will contain the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers from user input.**
