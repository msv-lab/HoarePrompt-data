The statement `prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]` updates the value of `prefix_sum` at the index `i + 1` based on the current value of `prefix_sum` at index `i` and the value of `a[i]`. The variable `i` is set to `n`, which is an integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Therefore, `i + 1` will range from 2 to 101 depending on the value of `n`.

The values of `prefix_sum[i]` and `a[i]` will determine the new value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]`. The other variables, including `n` and `i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to n, and `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`.**
