According to the code, the loop execution depends primarily on the value of `n`. Since `n` is given to be an input integer and is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100, we know the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n - 1`. The `prefix_sum` list is initialized to be of length `n + 1`, which is appropriate for holding the cumulative sums if necessary within the loop.

Thus, `n` needs to be validated to ensure it meets the conditions specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and at the start of the loop:
- `i` should be initialized to 0 as it will be the starting index.
- `prefix_sum` is to be unchanged as its purpose will be defined within the loop body (assuming it is correctly initialized to contain n + 1 zeros).

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros**
