The code assigns the value of `r` to `l`. The value of `r` is given as 3, thus `l` will now also be 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `r` is 3; `k` is increased by 1; `l` is 3.**
