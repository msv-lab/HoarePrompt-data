The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as the parameters are described in the context of the array `A`. Instead, it operates with an input defined as `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in the array) and `A` (a list of integers). The parameter `n` must be between 1 and 100, and each integer in list `A` must satisfy the condition that it lies within the range of -1000 to 1000. 

The output of the function is not provided in the prompt. However, the function is expected to process the list `A` based on its contents and potentially return a result based on the operations performed on those integers in the list.

Functionality: **The function implicitly accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array A, and a list A containing n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The specific return value is not defined in the prompt.**
