The statement `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console, but it does not affect the numerical values or states of any variables. The values of `n`, `i`, and `prefix_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[j]` is equal to the sum of the first `j` elements of the list `a` for `j` in the range [0, n], and the current value of `prefix_sum[n]` is equal to 0. The output is 'NO'.**
