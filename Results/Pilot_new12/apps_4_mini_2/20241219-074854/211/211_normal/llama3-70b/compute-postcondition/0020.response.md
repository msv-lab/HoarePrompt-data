The code assigns the value of `r` to `l`. Therefore, the value of `l` becomes equal to the value of `r`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state must reflect the updated value of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 1; `l` is equal to `r` (1).**
