The code assigns the value of `r` to `l`. Since `r` is equal to `2`, `l` will now also be `2`. Other variables remain unaffected. The output state will reflect the updated value of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is 3, `l` is now 2, `r` is 2, `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
