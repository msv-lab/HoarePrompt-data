The code snippet `print('YES')` outputs the string 'YES'. The initial variable states remain unchanged, as `n`, `i`, and `prefix_sum` are unaffected by the print statement. The other information about the variables stays valid since no operations alter their values or states.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[j]` is equal to the sum of the first `j` elements of the list `a` for `j` in the range [0, n]. The value of `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0; 'YES' is printed.**
