The code snippet executes a print statement, outputting the current values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. The values of these variables remain unchanged after the execution. The conditions provided indicate that `k` is 2, `l` is 1, and `r` is 2, all of which are directly printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`. The output printed is: k = 2, l = 1, r = 2.**
