Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[j]` is equal to the sum of the first `j` elements of the list `a` for `j` in the range [0, n]. If the loop does not execute (if `n` is 0), `prefix_sum` remains a list of length 1 filled with zero.**
