According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `i` is equal to `n - 1`, it indicates that `r` has taken values from 1 up to `n`. Since `r` is currently 2 and is set to maintain that value for this iteration of `r`, we need to examine the potential end state.

At the end of the last iteration, `r` is equal to 2, and it will increment by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `r` needs to increment and become 3. Since `r` is incremented and must still be within the limits of `1` to `n`, `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `r` is 3**
