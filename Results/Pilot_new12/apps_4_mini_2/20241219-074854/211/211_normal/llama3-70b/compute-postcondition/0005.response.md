According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` relative to `n`. The loop will iterate while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` has to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for executing the loop again requires that `i` is less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `prefix_sum[1]` which is equal to `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`, where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1**
