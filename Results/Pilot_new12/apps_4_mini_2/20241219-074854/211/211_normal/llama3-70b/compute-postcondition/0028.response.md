The provided code attempts to print the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. However, there is no prior assignment or definition for `k` and `l` in the given initial state. The initial state indicates that `n`, `i`, and `r` are defined, but since `k` and `l` are not initialized, they will likely lead to a NameError if executed.

Since no variable values were assigned to `k` or `l`, and `r` retains its value of `3`, we can note that the output pertaining to `k` and `l` is unknown while `r` is clearly defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `r` is 3; `k` and `l` are not defined.**
