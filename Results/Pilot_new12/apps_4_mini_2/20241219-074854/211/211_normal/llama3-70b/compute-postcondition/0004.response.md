To simulate the execution given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we start with:

Initial State: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.

The code provided is:
```
prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
```

Now we analyze the impact of this line of code:

1. The variable `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1` evaluates to 1.
2. `prefix_sum[i]` translates to `prefix_sum[0]`, which is the first element of the `prefix_sum` list and is initialized to 0.
3. The variable `a[i]` translates to `a[0]`. The exact value of `a[0]` is not contextualized in the initial state, so we must consider it as a value that is derived from the input not specified in the precondition.
4. Thus, the assignment updates `prefix_sum[1]` to `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`.

After executing the code, we retain the information that `n` is still an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and we need to specify what `prefix_sum[1]` is specifically equal to.

The output state after this code snippet execution should indicate the value that `prefix_sum[1]` has acquired based on `a[0]` (although we cannot define `a[0]` specifically without further context).

Conclusively, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except `prefix_sum[1]` which is equal to `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`, where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0**.
