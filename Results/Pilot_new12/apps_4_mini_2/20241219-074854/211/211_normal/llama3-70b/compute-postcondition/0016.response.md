According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1 since the range for `r` starts at 1 and ends at `n + 1`. Given that `n` is an input integer within the range [1, 100], it will always be valid. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, so it doesn't impact the execution of the loop. The `prefix_sum` being a list of length `n + 1` and containing valid sums ensures that all required elements are present for the loop body to potentially process. The fact that `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0 indicates that there is at least some sum present in the list.

At the point right before the loop starts, `k` and `l` are set to 1, and 'YES' is printed, which are just states with predefined values. The loop expects `r` to start from 1; thus `r` will be 1 at the outset of the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 1**
