The variable `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to be equal to the sum of `prefix_sum[i]` and `a[i]`. Given that `n` is an input integer with the condition (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `n` must be greater than 1, `i` can range from 1 to `n-1`. The initial conditions indicate that `prefix_sum` has valid values based on previously set conditions.

Before executing the code:
- `prefix_sum[0]` is 0.
- `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `prefix_sum[0] + a[0] = 0 + a[0] = a[0]`.

After executing the code, we only know the value of `prefix_sum[i]` where `i` has changed as per the executed line. Therefore, `prefix_sum[i + 1]` will reflect the case:
- `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is equal to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`, which we cannot define exactly without knowing the value of `a[i]`.

Thus, in terms of the state after execution, it will depend on the existing values of `prefix_sum` from previous indices and `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is in the range [1, n-1], `prefix_sum` is updated with `prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`.**
