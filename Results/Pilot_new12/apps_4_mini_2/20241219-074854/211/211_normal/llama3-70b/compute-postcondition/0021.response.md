Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is set to 2, `l` remains equal to `r` (1), if `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.***
