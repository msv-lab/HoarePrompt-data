The code initializes the `prefix_sum` variable as a list containing `n + 1` zeros. Since `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 100, `prefix_sum` will be a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers from user input, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**
