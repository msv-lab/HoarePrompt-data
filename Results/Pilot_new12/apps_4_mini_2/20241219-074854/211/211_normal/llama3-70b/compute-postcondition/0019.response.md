The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` was 1, so after the execution, the new value of `k` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 1; the output of the print statement is 1 1 1.**
