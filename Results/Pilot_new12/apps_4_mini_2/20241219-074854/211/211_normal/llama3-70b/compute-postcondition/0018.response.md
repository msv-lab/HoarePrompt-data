The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs the current values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. Since the variables `k`, `l`, and `r` have been defined in the initial state, their values are:

- `k` is 1
- `l` is 1
- `r` is 1

This output does not change the values of these variables, nor does it affect other variables. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 1 1 1.**
