Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is 1. The value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not 0 and the value of `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.***
