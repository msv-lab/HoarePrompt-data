To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop control variables and their relationships.

1. The loop iterates over the range `1` to `n + 1`, which means it will execute for values of `r` from `1` to `n`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `r` must be equal to `1` since `l` remains equal to `r`, and we can infer `l = 1`.
3. We also know that `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `0` and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`, which must hold true for the loop to execute again.
4. In the next iteration, `r` will increment by `1` due to the loop control defined by the `for r in range(1, n + 1)` construct.
5. Therefore, the new value of `r` will be `2`.
6. For the loop to potentially execute again, we need to ensure that `r` is still within the specified range, meaning `r` should be less than or equal to `n` (which is initially true as `r` is starting from `1`).

Following this reasoning:

- We keep `n` as is since it remains the same for subsequent iterations.
- `r` is updated to `2`.
- The conditions regarding `prefix_sum[r]` remain unchanged while maintaining `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to `0` and `prefix_sum[2]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.

State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, `k` is set to 2, `l` is equal to 1, `r` is 2, `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to 0 and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
