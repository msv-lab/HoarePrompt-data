Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential edge cases correctly. Specifically, consider the case where the array consists entirely of non-zero numbers that sum up to zero. For example, the input:

```
3
1 1 -2
```

In this case, the total sum is `0`, so the program moves to the second part where it checks for non-zero elements. It will output "YES" and divide the array into `A[1]` and `A[2]`, which are both non-zero, but `A[3]` will simply be excluded without considering the possibility of creating multiple valid subarrays.

The program incorrectly assumes that if the overall sum of the array is `0`, it can still split the array into parts such that each part's sum is non-zero without verifying all combinations. This means the program may fail to output `NO` in situations where splitting isn't valid. 

Thus, the program fails for this input case, showcasing that it does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case.
