You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Program:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential edge cases correctly. Specifically, consider the case where the array consists entirely of non-zero numbers that sum up to zero. For example, the input:

```
3
1 1 -2
```

In this case, the total sum is `0`, so the program moves to the second part where it checks for non-zero elements. It will output "YES" and divide the array into `A[1]` and `A[2]`, which are both non-zero, but `A[3]` will simply be excluded without considering the possibility of creating multiple valid subarrays.

The program incorrectly assumes that if the overall sum of the array is `0`, it can still split the array into parts such that each part's sum is non-zero without verifying all combinations. This means the program may fail to output `NO` in situations where splitting isn't valid. 

Thus, the program fails for this input case, showcasing that it does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a positive integer n, representing the number of elements in an integer list A, which contains n integers ranging from -1000 to 1000. It calculates the sum of the elements in A. If the total sum is non-zero, it prints 'YES', '1', and the total number of elements n. If the total sum is zero, it looks for the first non-zero element in A. If a non-zero element is found, it prints 'YES', '2', '1', and the index of the non-zero element (1-based), followed by the indices from the next element to n. If all elements in A are zero, it prints 'NO'. In summary, the function outputs whether a valid non-zero sequence can be established from the list A, handling both scenarios where the sum is zero or non-zero. Additionally, it contains a potential edge case where if all elements are zero, it explicitly prints 'NO', which may not have been adequately highlighted in the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
