Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem in every potential case. While it correctly identifies when the total sum of the array is non-zero and, in that case, outputs the entire array as one valid partition, it fails to address the cases where splitting is necessary when the sum is zero and the array contains non-zero elements. 

Consider the case where the array has elements such that they can form multiple valid non-zero subarrays but do not meet the criteria effectively. For instance, an input like `4\n1 -1 2 -2` would lead the total sum to be `0`. The current implementation would not find a valid way to split even though it could have been split into multiple non-zero subarrays like `[1]` and `[-1, 2, -2]`. 

Thus, the program doesn't always achieve valid partitions as required by the problem for all possible inputs leading to outputs that do not satisfy the provided constraints. Therefore, there are cases where it can fail to produce a valid output, making it incorrect.
