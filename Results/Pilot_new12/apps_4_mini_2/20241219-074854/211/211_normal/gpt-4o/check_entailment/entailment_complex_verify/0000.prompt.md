You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    if total_sum != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the given program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic for splitting the array A while adhering to the constraint that the sum of the elements in each new array must not be zero.

Here's the breakdown:

1. The program first checks if the total sum of the array A is non-zero. If it is non-zero, it outputs "YES", indicates that there is one segment consisting of the entire array, which indeed satisfies the condition.

2. If the total sum is zero, the program attempts to find a non-zero element in the array A so that it can split it into two segments: one including elements up to that non-zero index, and the other including the remaining elements. This is executed inside a loop that checks each element.

3. If all elements are zero, it outputs "NO".

However, there is a potential flaw in the implementation:

- The code only checks for total sum = 0 and then looks for a non-zero element to create two segments. But if the total sum of non-zero elements can be zero, it might end up proposing a split that results in zero-sum subarrays. For example, if the array consists of elements where pairs cancel each other out (e.g., 3, -3), the program could still return "YES" with an invalid configuration.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the case where the input is:
```
4
3 -3 5 -5
```
- The total sum is zero.
- The first non-zero element is `3` at index 1. The program would then output:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 4
```
- However, the new segments `A[1...1]` (which is 3) and `A[2...4]` (which is -3 + 5 - 5 = -3) are not valid as both segments satisfy the zero-sum condition.

Thus, the program is not accounting for all potential cases where a split could lead to subarrays summing to zero despite individual elements being non-zero.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array A, and A is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies -1000 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if (total_sum != 0) :
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_sum` is equal to 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). If at least one element in `A` is not 0, it would print 'YES' followed by '2', '1', and the index of the non-zero element. If all elements in A are 0, it will print 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, and `total_sum` is the sum of elements in `A`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, then "1" is printed followed by the value of `n`. If `total_sum` is equal to 0, then if at least one element in `A` is not 0, it prints 'YES' followed by '2', '1', and the index of the non-zero element. If all elements in `A` are 0, it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer n, representing the number of elements in an integer list A, which contains n integers ranging from -1000 to 1000. It calculates the sum of the elements in A. If the total sum is non-zero, it prints 'YES', '1', and the total number of elements n. If the total sum is zero, it looks for the first non-zero element in A. If a non-zero element is found, it prints 'YES', '2', '1', and the index of the non-zero element (1-based), followed by the indices from the next element to n. If all elements in A are zero, it prints 'NO'. In summary, the function outputs whether a valid non-zero sequence can be established from the list A, handling both scenarios where the sum is zero or non-zero. Additionally, it contains a potential edge case where if all elements are zero, it explicitly prints 'NO', which may not have been adequately highlighted in the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
