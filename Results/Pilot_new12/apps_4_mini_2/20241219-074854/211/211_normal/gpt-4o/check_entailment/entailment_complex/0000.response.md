To evaluate the correctness of the annotated Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code's behavior.

### Problem description requirements:
1. The function must split an array `A` into several non-empty subarrays such that the sum of each new subarray is not zero.
2. If it is impossible to split `A` as defined (e.g., all elements are zero), the function should print "NO".
3. If a valid split is possible, it should print "YES", the number of subarrays, and provide the indices (1-based) of these subarrays.
4. For valid outputs, the index ranges should cover the entire array and must not overlap (each new array's starting point follows directly after the previous one).

### Program behavior analysis:
1. The program calculates the total sum of the elements in the array `A`.
2. If `total_sum` is not zero, it prints "YES", "1", and the range "1 n", which means the entire array is one single valid subarray.
3. If `total_sum` is zero, it checks for the first non-zero element:
   - If such an element is found, it effectively splits the array into two parts: from the start to that first non-zero element and from the next element to the end of the array. Both these parts will have non-zero sums.
   - If the array consists of all zeros, it outputs "NO", which is the correct behavior because it is impossible to create valid subarrays under these conditions.

### Edge cases:
- The program correctly identifies when the array contains all zeros and outputs "NO".
- It appropriately identifies when the total sum of the array is not zero and handles that case.

### Conclusion on correctness:
1. **For inputs with a non-zero total sum**: The program works correctly by treating the whole array as a valid subarray.
2. **For inputs with a zero total sum but at least one non-zero element**: The program finds a way to split the array into two valid segments, thus fulfilling the requirement.
3. **For inputs with all elements zero**: The program correctly outputs "NO".

All edge cases and provided scenarios in the problem have been considered and appropriately handled by the program. 

Thus, the implementation meets the problem's requirements adequately.

### Final statement:
Correctness: **True**
