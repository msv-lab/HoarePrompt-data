The `print` function outputs the string 'YES' to the console, but it does not change any variable values or states. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the console output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of the first element of `A`, A[0], is not 0, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
