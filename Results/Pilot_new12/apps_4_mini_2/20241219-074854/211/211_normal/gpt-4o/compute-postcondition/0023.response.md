According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop can execute again for the second time if `n` is greater than 1. In preparation for the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1 to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2**
