Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1. If `A[1]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, printed output is '1', '2', '3', and `n` is unchanged, with a break occurring from the most internal loop or if statement.***
