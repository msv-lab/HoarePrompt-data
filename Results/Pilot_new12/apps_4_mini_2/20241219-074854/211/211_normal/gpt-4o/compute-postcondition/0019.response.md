The code will print the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. The current value of `i` is 1, so the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 2. Therefore, the output will be `'1', 2`.

The variable `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed; printed output is '1', 2.**
