According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. The current state shows that `total_sum` is equal to 0 before the loop starts, which does not affect the execution of the loop. However, we should note that `i` needs to be initialized, and since it will start from 0 during the first iteration of the loop, it is essential to reflect this.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
