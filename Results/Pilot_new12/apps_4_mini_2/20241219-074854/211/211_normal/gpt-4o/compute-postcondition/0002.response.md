The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `A`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, and `A` contains `n` integers, `total_sum` is calculated as the total of all integers in `A`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of elements in `A`.**
