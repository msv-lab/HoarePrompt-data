The code prints '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. Given that the initial state states that `i` is 0, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of the first element of `A`, A[0], is not 0, and '1 1' is printed to the console.**
