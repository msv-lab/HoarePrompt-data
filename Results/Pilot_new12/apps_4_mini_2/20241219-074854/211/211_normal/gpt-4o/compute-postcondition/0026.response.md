The code prints the string '1' followed by the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` equals 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and '3' has been printed to the console.**
