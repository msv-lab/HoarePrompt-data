The `print` statement outputs the string '2' to the console. The variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` remain unaffected, and the message 'YES' was already printed prior to this code execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and 'YES' has been printed; '2' has been printed.**
