The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed to the console, '3' has been printed to the console, and `4`, `n` has been printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
