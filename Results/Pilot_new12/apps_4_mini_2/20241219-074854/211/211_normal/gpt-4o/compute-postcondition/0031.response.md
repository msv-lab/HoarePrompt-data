Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, and `total_sum` is the sum of elements in `A`. If `total_sum` is not equal to 0, then "1" is printed followed by the value of `n`. If `total_sum` is equal to 0, then if at least one element in `A` is not 0, it prints 'YES' followed by '2', '1', and the index of the non-zero element. If all elements in `A` are 0, it prints 'NO'.***
