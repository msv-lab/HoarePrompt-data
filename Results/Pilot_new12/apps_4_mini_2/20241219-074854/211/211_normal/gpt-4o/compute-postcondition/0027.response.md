In the given code snippet, `print(i + 2, n)` is executed. Here, the variable `i` is initially 2, and `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100. The `print` function outputs the values of `i + 2` and `n`. 

Calculating the values:
- `i + 2` becomes `2 + 2`, which is `4`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer between 1 and 100.

The other variables in the initial state (`A`, `total_sum`, and the printed messages) are not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and '3' has been printed to the console. The values printed to the console are `4` and `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed to the console, '3' has been printed to the console, and `4`, `n` has been printed to the console.**
