The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console but does not modify any of the existing variables in the initial state. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged, while the action of printing is recognized.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, and 'YES' has been printed to the console.**
