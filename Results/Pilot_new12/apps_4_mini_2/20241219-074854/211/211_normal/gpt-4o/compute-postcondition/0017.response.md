The code outputs 'YES', which does not modify the value of any variables. The values of `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and 'YES' has been printed.**
