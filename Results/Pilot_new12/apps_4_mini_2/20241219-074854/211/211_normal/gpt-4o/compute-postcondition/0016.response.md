According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100, the loop can execute again for the next increment of `i`. 

After this iteration, `i` will be increased by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` will need to be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to allow further iterations beyond the next.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1.**
