The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed; printed output is '1', '2', '3', `n` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
