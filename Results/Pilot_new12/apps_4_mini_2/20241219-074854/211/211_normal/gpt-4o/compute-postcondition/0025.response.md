The code simply prints the value '2' to the console. It does not affect any of the variables in the given state. The output state remains consistent with the initial state of the variables, with the addition of the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and '2' has been printed to the console.**
