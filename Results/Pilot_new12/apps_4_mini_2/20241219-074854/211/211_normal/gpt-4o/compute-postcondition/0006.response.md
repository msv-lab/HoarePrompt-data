The code executes a print statement that outputs "1" followed by the value of `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and other variables are also unaffected. The output state is derived from what is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of elements in `A`, current value of `total_sum` is not equal to 0, and "1" is printed followed by the value of `n`.**
