The code will print the values of `i + 2` and `n`. The current value of `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. So, `i + 2` evaluates to 3. 

The printed output will be:
- The first part is `i + 2`, which is 3.
- The second part is `n`, which remains unchanged.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed; printed output is '1', 2, '3', and `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed; printed output is '1', 2, '3', `n` is unchanged.**
