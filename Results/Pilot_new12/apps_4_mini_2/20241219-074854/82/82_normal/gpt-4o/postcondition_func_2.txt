Functionality: The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, where both integers are guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to \(10^9\). If `a` is equal to `b`, the function immediately returns 0. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the function calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`. It then initializes `min_lcm` to infinity and `min_k` to 0. The function proceeds to iterate over the divisors of `diff` up to its square root, attempting to compute modified values `new_a` and `new_b` to find the minimum least common multiple (LCM) among them using another function `func_2`. If no divisors are found that yield a valid candidate for LCM computation, `min_k` remains 0. The final state of the function returns `min_k`, which corresponds either to the candidate divisor that produced the minimum LCM or remains 0 if no such candidate was found (indicating that the loop did not execute). Thus, the function returns either 0 or a positive integer representing a candidate divisor.
