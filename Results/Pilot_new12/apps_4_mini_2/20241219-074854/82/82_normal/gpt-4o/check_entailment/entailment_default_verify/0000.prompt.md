You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the provided program, we first need to understand its logic and the requirements of the problem description.

The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If there are several such values of \( k \), the smallest one should be returned. 

Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Function for GCD:** `func_1(x, y)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **Function for LCM:** `func_2(x, y)` computes LCM using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. **Core Logic:** 
    - If \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, it correctly returns \( k = 0 \) since \( \text{LCM}(a + 0, b + 0) = \text{LCM}(a, a) = a \).
    - It computes the absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \) and iterates through the divisors of this difference to test candidate values for \( k \).

However, the key issue arises when considering edge cases and whether all potential values of \( k \) (including \( k = 0 \)) are evaluated properly:

For example:
- Using the input \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \):
    - Here, \( \text{diff} = |1 - 2| = 1 \).
    - The only divisor to check would be 1.
    - For \( k = 0 \): LCM(1, 2) = 2.
    - For \( k = 1 \): LCM(2, 3) = 6.
    - The program returns \( k = 1 \), but the correct answer is \( k = 0 \) since it gives a smaller LCM of 2 compared to LCM of 6 from \( k = 1 \).

This case demonstrates that the program could return an incorrect minimum \( k \) because it does not adequately check for the minimum LCM at \( k = 0 \) when iterating only through positive divisors derived from the difference.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle the case where \( k = 0 \) is the optimal solution for minimizing LCM, particularly when \( a \) and \( b \) are close or when one is much smaller than the other.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : Functionality: The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, where both integers are guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to \(10^9\). If `a` is equal to `b`, the function immediately returns 0. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the function calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`. It then initializes `min_lcm` to infinity and `min_k` to 0. The function proceeds to iterate over the divisors of `diff` up to its square root, attempting to compute modified values `new_a` and `new_b` to find the minimum least common multiple (LCM) among them using another function `func_2`. If no divisors are found that yield a valid candidate for LCM computation, `min_k` remains 0. The final state of the function returns `min_k`, which corresponds either to the candidate divisor that produced the minimum LCM or remains 0 if no such candidate was found (indicating that the loop did not execute). Thus, the function returns either 0 or a positive integer representing a candidate divisor.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
