The problem involves finding a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \( k \) yielding the same minimum LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be returned.

Upon inspecting the provided functions and their descriptions:

1. **func_1**: Correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of two numbers. The hints agree with the code, and there are no edge cases here as \( a \) and \( b \) are both guaranteed to be at least 1.
  
2. **func_2**: Computes the LCM using the relationship between GCD and LCM. Again this assumes \( x \) and \( y \) are both valid and non-zero, which they are based on the problem constraints. The hints correctly depict the function's operation.

3. **func_3**: 
   - This function checks if \( a \) is equal to \( b \) and returns \( 0 \) in that case, which is correct. 
   - It calculates the absolute difference \( diff \) between \( a \) and \( b \).
   - The logic iterates over potential divisors of \( diff \), which is valid given the task to minimize LCM when \( a \neq b \).
   - It computes new values based on the divisors and re-calculates LCM using `func_2`.

The main concern arises from the loop that checks divisors of \( diff \). The implementation depends on finding the appropriate divisors but may not handle all potential \( k \) effectively, particularly larger values. The algorithm only calculates LCM values for the range of divisors up to the square root of \( diff \). There is no guarantee that every potential LCM scenario has been considered, particularly if both \( a \) and \( b \) are far apart.

- If \( a \) and \( b \) have a significant difference, it might return a \( k \) that is not optimal or miss out on lower values altogether. Specifically, if \( k \) could equal \( 0 \) yet the loop might yield a divisor that produces a value greater than \( 0 \).

### Example Case:
For inputs like \( (5, 10) \), the expected output is \( 0 \) because \( 5 + 0 = 5 \) and \( 10 + 0 = 10 \) result in LCM of \( 10 \). 
However, the algorithm may miss this optimal return if it focuses purely on divisors of the difference.

Given this reasoning:

Correctness: **False**.
