The original assessment correctly identifies the program's overall functionality in addressing the problem described which involves finding the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple of `a + k` and `b + k` is minimized.

1. **Correctness of Functions**: The functions implemented show proper handling of calculating the GCD and LCM. The methods used for GCD (Euclidean algorithm) and for LCM (using GCD) are both correct and efficient for the input constraints provided.

2. **Main Logic (func_3)**:
   - The function starts by checking if `a` and `b` are equal, returning `0` if they are, which is correct as this would be the trivial case where the LCM does not need adjustment.
   - It calculates the absolute difference `diff` and iterates over all possible divisors of this difference to find potential values for `k`.
   - For each divisor, it computes the new potential values of `a` and `b`, subsequently calculating the LCM and comparing it to track the minimum value.
   - The program correctly identifies both the minimum LCM and the corresponding smallest `k`.

3. **Annotated Code Verification**: The annotations provided correctly document the state of variables at various points in the code. They reinforce that all values are consistent with the problem description, logically leading through the operations performed in the functions.

4. **Examples Validation**: Through the original cases given in the problem description, the program outputs correct results as documented.

Given the annotations and the assessment made in the initial evaluation, as well as the steps logically following the requirements of the problem, I confirm that the program behaves as intended without any logical errors.

Final: **True**
