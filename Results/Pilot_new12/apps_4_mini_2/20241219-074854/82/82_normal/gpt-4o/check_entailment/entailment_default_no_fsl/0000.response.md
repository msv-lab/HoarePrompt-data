To determine the correctness of the provided code and its ability to solve the problem as described, let's break down the components based on the problem requirements and the provided output hints.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We are given two integers `a` and `b`.
2. We need to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized.
3. In case there are multiple `k` values yielding the same minimal LCM, we should choose the smallest `k`.

### Code Analysis:
- The function `func_3(a, b)` aims to handle this problem:
  - If `a` equals `b`, `k` should be `0` because `LCM(a, a) = a`.
  - If they are not equal, it calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`.
  - It then looks for the divisors of this difference.
  - For each divisor, it calculates `new_a` and `new_b` such that they are both multiples of the divisor, attempting to find the minimum LCM using `func_2`.
  - It tracks the minimum LCM and the corresponding `k` value.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Checking All Divisors**: The function iterates over `1` to `sqrt(diff)` which should ideally find all divisors. However, the logic for checking both `k` and `diff // k` needs to ensure both produce valid integers when incrementing `a` and `b`.
2. **Finding the Minimum LCM**: The function implementation might miss some conditions where a smaller `k` exists leading to a better LCM. It might not fully explore all modulo operations for potential `k` values effectively.

### Edge Case/Counter Example:
Let's consider the case where:
- `a = 1`
- `b = 2`

Using the function:
- `diff = |1 - 2| = 1`
- The only divisor for `1` is `1`. 
- So, `new_a = 1 + 1 (k) = 2` and `new_b = 2 + 1 (k) = 3`.
- The LCM of `2` and `3` is `6`.
- However, for `k = 0`, `LCM(1, 2) = 2`, which is actually less than the LCM found with `k = 1`.

In this case:
- The function would return `k = 1`, but the smallest non-negative integer `k` for the correct minimum LCM is `0`.
- Therefore, it will yield an incorrect result as it does not identify that `k = 0` yields a smaller LCM for this set.

### Conclusion:
The provided code fails for specific edge cases where choosing a `k` of `0` yields a smaller LCM than any computed for modified `a` and `b`. Thus, based on our analysis of the function implementation and the counterexample:

Correctness: **False**
