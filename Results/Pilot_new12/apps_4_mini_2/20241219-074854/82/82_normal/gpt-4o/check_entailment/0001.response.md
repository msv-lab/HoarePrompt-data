To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it in relation to the problem description and examine its logic and potential edge cases.

The program aims to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized. If there are multiple values resulting in the same minimum LCM, the smallest `k` should be chosen.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Function**: The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
   
2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Function**: The function `func_2` computes LCM using the relation `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)` which is accurate.

3. **Main Logic to find `k`**:
   - The function `func_3` starts by checking if `a` and `b` are equal. If so, it returns `0` since `k=0` will always yield `lcm(a, b) = a = b`.
   - The function then computes the absolute difference `diff = |a - b|`.
   - It iterates through all possible divisors of `diff`, computing candidate values of `k` and checks the potential LCM for `a + candidate` and `b + candidate`.
   - It tracks the minimum LCM and the corresponding value of `k`.

### Potential Test Cases:
Let's consider several test cases from the problem description and the edge cases:

1. **Case (6, 10)**: 
   - `k = 2` gives `lcm(8, 12) = 24`, which is correct.
   
2. **Case (21, 31)**: 
   - `k = 9` gives `lcm(30, 40) = 120`, which is correct.
   
3. **Case (5, 10)**: 
   - `k = 0` gives `lcm(5, 10) = 10`, which is correct.

4. **Edge Case (1, 1000000000)**:
   - To analyze if it covers all cases, if we consider `a = 1` and `b = 10^9`, the difference `diff = 999999999`.
   - The program should test different values of `k` to find the optimal one among many possible candidates formed by the divisors of `999999999`.

5. **Edge Case (1, 2)**:
   - Checking `k = 0` gives `lcm(1, 2) = 2`, which is correct. But we should also check `k = 1`, which gives us `lcm(2, 3) = 6`. Here the optimal solution is still `k = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program implements the required algorithm to minimize the LCM by iterating over the possible divisors of the difference between `a` and `b`. It appears to correctly return the smallest `k` in the cases analyzed. Furthermore, it correctly handles the cases when `a` equals `b` and considers possible optimizations based on the divisors.

Due to the completeness of the division logic and systematic checking of candidate values, I could not find a potential case where the program fails to satisfy the problem requirements.

Therefore, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**
