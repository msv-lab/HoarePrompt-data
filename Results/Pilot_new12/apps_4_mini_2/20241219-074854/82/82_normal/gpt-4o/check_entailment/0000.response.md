To analyze the correctness of the provided program, we first need to understand its logic and the requirements of the problem description.

The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If there are several such values of \( k \), the smallest one should be returned. 

Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Function for GCD:** `func_1(x, y)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **Function for LCM:** `func_2(x, y)` computes LCM using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. **Core Logic:** 
    - If \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, it correctly returns \( k = 0 \) since \( \text{LCM}(a + 0, b + 0) = \text{LCM}(a, a) = a \).
    - It computes the absolute difference \( \text{diff} = |a - b| \) and iterates through the divisors of this difference to test candidate values for \( k \).

However, the key issue arises when considering edge cases and whether all potential values of \( k \) (including \( k = 0 \)) are evaluated properly:

For example:
- Using the input \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \):
    - Here, \( \text{diff} = |1 - 2| = 1 \).
    - The only divisor to check would be 1.
    - For \( k = 0 \): LCM(1, 2) = 2.
    - For \( k = 1 \): LCM(2, 3) = 6.
    - The program returns \( k = 1 \), but the correct answer is \( k = 0 \) since it gives a smaller LCM of 2 compared to LCM of 6 from \( k = 1 \).

This case demonstrates that the program could return an incorrect minimum \( k \) because it does not adequately check for the minimum LCM at \( k = 0 \) when iterating only through positive divisors derived from the difference.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle the case where \( k = 0 \) is the optimal solution for minimizing LCM, particularly when \( a \) and \( b \) are close or when one is much smaller than the other.
