# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it in relation to the problem description and examine its logic and potential edge cases.

The program aims to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized. If there are multiple values resulting in the same minimum LCM, the smallest `k` should be chosen.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Function**: The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
   
2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Function**: The function `func_2` computes LCM using the relation `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)` which is accurate.

3. **Main Logic to find `k`**:
   - The function `func_3` starts by checking if `a` and `b` are equal. If so, it returns `0` since `k=0` will always yield `lcm(a, b) = a = b`.
   - The function then computes the absolute difference `diff = |a - b|`.
   - It iterates through all possible divisors of `diff`, computing candidate values of `k` and checks the potential LCM for `a + candidate` and `b + candidate`.
   - It tracks the minimum LCM and the corresponding value of `k`.

### Potential Test Cases:
Let's consider several test cases from the problem description and the edge cases:

1. **Case (6, 10)**: 
   - `k = 2` gives `lcm(8, 12) = 24`, which is correct.
   
2. **Case (21, 31)**: 
   - `k = 9` gives `lcm(30, 40) = 120`, which is correct.
   
3. **Case (5, 10)**: 
   - `k = 0` gives `lcm(5, 10) = 10`, which is correct.

4. **Edge Case (1, 1000000000)**:
   - To analyze if it covers all cases, if we consider `a = 1` and `b = 10^9`, the difference `diff = 999999999`.
   - The program should test different values of `k` to find the optimal one among many possible candidates formed by the divisors of `999999999`.

5. **Edge Case (1, 2)**:
   - Checking `k = 0` gives `lcm(1, 2) = 2`, which is correct. But we should also check `k = 1`, which gives us `lcm(2, 3) = 6`. Here the optimal solution is still `k = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program implements the required algorithm to minimize the LCM by iterating over the possible divisors of the difference between `a` and `b`. It appears to correctly return the smallest `k` in the cases analyzed. Furthermore, it correctly handles the cases when `a` equals `b` and considers possible optimizations based on the divisors.

Due to the completeness of the division logic and systematic checking of candidate values, I could not find a potential case where the program fails to satisfy the problem requirements.

Therefore, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : Functionality: The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, where both integers are guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to \(10^9\). If `a` is equal to `b`, the function immediately returns 0. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the function calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`. It then initializes `min_lcm` to infinity and `min_k` to 0. The function proceeds to iterate over the divisors of `diff` up to its square root, attempting to compute modified values `new_a` and `new_b` to find the minimum least common multiple (LCM) among them using another function `func_2`. If no divisors are found that yield a valid candidate for LCM computation, `min_k` remains 0. The final state of the function returns `min_k`, which corresponds either to the candidate divisor that produced the minimum LCM or remains 0 if no such candidate was found (indicating that the loop did not execute). Thus, the function returns either 0 or a positive integer representing a candidate divisor.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
