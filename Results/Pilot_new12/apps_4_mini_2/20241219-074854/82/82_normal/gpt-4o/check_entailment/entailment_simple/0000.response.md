To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, letâ€™s analyze its functionality with respect to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \( k \) yielding the same minimum LCM, we need to choose the smallest \( k \).

### Program Overview:
1. **Function `func_1(x, y)`**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This ensures that LCM calculations in `func_2` are accurate, as LCM can be expressed in terms of GCD.
   
2. **Function `func_2(x, y)`**: Calculates the LCM of two integers \( x \) and \( y \) using the formula:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)}
   \]
   
3. **Function `func_3(a, b)`**: 
   - Handles the case where \( a \) is equal to \( b \) by returning 0 since \( k \) can be 0 and LCM(a, a) is \( a \).
   - If \( a \) does not equal \( b \), it computes the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \). It goes through the divisors of the difference and for each divisor \( k \), it calculates potential new values of \( a \) and \( b \) after the addition of \( k \).
   - It keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding smallest \( k \).

### Analysis of Correctness:
- **Handles Edge Case**: It correctly returns 0 when both numbers are equal, which is explicitly stated in the problem.
  
- **Iterates Through Divisors**: It correctly iterates through the divisors of the difference \( |a - b| \). For each divisor, it considers both that divisor and its pair (difference divided by the divisor) to determine candidate values for \( k \).
  
- **Calculates LCM Correctly**: The use of functions `func_1` and `func_2` ensures that the LCM is calculated correctly at each step.
  
- **Maintains Minimum LCM and Corresponding k**: The logic used to update `min_lcm` and `min_k` ensures that the smallest \( k \) yielding the minimum LCM is selected.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the steps required by the problem description. 

Therefore, based on this analysis:

Correctness: **True**
