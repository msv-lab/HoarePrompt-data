To determine the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, let's break down the code and its logic in relation to the requirements.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Function func_1**:
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. 
   - The annotations suggest that it works correctly within the defined constraints since both arguments are guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^9\).

2. **Function func_2**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) by using the formula \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
   - It assumes that `func_1` will never return zero because the inputs are always positive integers (between 1 and \(10^9\)), which conforms to the constraints and thus seems safe.

3. **Function func_3**:
   - This function is designed to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized.
   - The check for \( a \) equal to \( b \) immediately returns 0, which is correct.
   - The difference \( \text{diff} = |a-b| \) is calculated, and it iterates through potential divisors of this difference to find the optimal \( k \).
   - For each divisor, it calculates the new modified values \( new_a \) and \( new_b \) to minimize the LCM.

### Check Against the Problem Description

1. **Minimum LCM**: The algorithm attempts to minimize the LCM of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) correctly by searching over divisors of their difference.
2. **Smallest Possible k**: During the calculations, if multiple valid candidates yield the same LCM, the algorithm ensures to keep track of the smallest \( k \).

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues

1. The algorithm does not consider the case where \( k = 0 \) outside of the immediate \( a = b \) check when \( |a-b| = 1 \). Thus, it may overlook certain scenarios where a trivial value (like 0) could yield an optimal result since it always starts searching from \( k = 1 \).
2. For larger values of \( a \) and \( b \) with a small difference (e.g., \( a=1000000000 \) and \( b=999999999 \)), it may not efficiently find the minimal \( k \) due to its dependence on the divisors.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the logic and edge cases, the program misses out on returning \( k = 0 \) possibly even when variances help in yielding a minimal LCM. Since the program does not cover every potential case as required by the problem description (specifically overlooking zero as a candidate when it might be valid), the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**

**Note**: An example where the program fails would be when \( a \) is significantly larger than \( b \) or vice versa, but the difference is minimal which would be overlooked during the search operation leading to a non-optimal solution.
