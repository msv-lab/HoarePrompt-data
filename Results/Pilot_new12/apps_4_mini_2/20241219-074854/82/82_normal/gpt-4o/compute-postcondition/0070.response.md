The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of the other variables `a`, `b`, `k`, `diff`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` remain unchanged, but `min_lcm` now holds the same value as `current_lcm`. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a â‰  b`; `k` is 4; `diff` is at least 4 and a multiple of 4; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is now equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
