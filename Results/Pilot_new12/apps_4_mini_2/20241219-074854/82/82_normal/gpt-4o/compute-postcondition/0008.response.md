In the provided code, the for loop iterates over a list containing the values of `k` and `diff // k`. For the loop to execute correctly, we need to ensure that both values are defined and that `diff // k` evaluates correctly based on the current values of `diff` and `k`.

Given the provided state:
- `k` is 1.
- `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`.
- Since `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9.

Now, let's analyze the candidates in the loop:
1. The first candidate is `k`, which is already defined as 1.
2. The second candidate is `diff // k`, which simplifies to `diff // 1`, equal to `diff`. Since `diff` is a positive integer, it will also be valid and correctly defined.

Thus, both candidates are defined, and the loop can execute. 

However, we should also establish what the initial value of `candidate` will be in terms of their progression through the loop. 

At the start of the loop:
- `candidate` will first take the value of `k`, which is 1.
- Then the candidate will take the value of `diff` (since `diff // k` equals `diff` when `k` is 1).

Therefore, the necessary states to mention are that `k` is 1, and `diff` is positive:

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b), min_lcm` is equal to `float('inf')`, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, and `candidate` is taking the values 1 and `diff` in the loop**.
