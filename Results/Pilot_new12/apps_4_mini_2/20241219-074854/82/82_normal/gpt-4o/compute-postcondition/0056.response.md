Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a â‰  b`. If `diff` is divisible by `k`, then the least common multiple, `min_lcm`, is determined by evaluating candidates based on `k` and `diff // k`, where `min_k` is the candidate that provides the minimum `current_lcm`. The loop executes for 2 iterations and if no valid candidates yield a `current_lcm`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their initialized states.***
