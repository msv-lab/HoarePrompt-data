The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The value of `current_lcm` was previously assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The variables `new_a` and `new_b` remain unchanged, thus their values persist in the output state. 

Output State: **`current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `new_a` and `new_b` remain unchanged; `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`.**
