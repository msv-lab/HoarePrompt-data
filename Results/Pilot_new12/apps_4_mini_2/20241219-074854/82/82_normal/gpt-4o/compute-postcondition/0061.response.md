To determine the output state after executing the provided snippet, we first need to analyze how `current_lcm` is impacted based on the values of `new_a` and `new_b`. The function `func_2` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the arguments passed to it, which are `new_a` and `new_b`.

### Variables Analysis:
- `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range from 1 to \(10^9\).
- `k` is equal to 4.
- The variable `diff` is constrained such that it must be at least 4 and a multiple of 4.
- `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

### Impact of the Code:
The code calculates `current_lcm` by calling `func_2` with `new_a` and `new_b` as inputs. However, the calculation of `new_a` and `new_b` depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `candidate`. Since `candidate` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot compute explicit values for `new_a`, `new_b`, or consequently `current_lcm`.

### Final Output State:
Given that `new_a` and `new_b` cannot be explicitly defined without knowing the `candidate`, the output state will only state that `current_lcm` has been calculated but cannot specify the value of `current_lcm`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a â‰  b`; `k` is 4; `diff` must be at least 4 and a multiple of 4; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is computed as `func_2(new_a, new_b)` but cannot be specified further.**
