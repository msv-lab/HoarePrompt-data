Since `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`, and `current_lcm` is assigned the return value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, the output state reflects that `min_lcm` now holds the same value as `current_lcm`. The states of the other variables (`b`, `candidate`, `new_a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is unchanged, `candidate` is unchanged, `new_a` is unchanged, `current_lcm` is assigned the return value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
