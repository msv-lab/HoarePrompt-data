Postcondition: ***`b` remains unchanged; `current_lcm` is updated to the return value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, where `new_a` is calculated as `(a + (diff // k) - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)` and `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`. As a result, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is equal to `candidate` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
