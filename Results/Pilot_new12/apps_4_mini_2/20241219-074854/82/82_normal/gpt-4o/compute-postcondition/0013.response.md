The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` remain unchanged aside from this assignment. Since `current_lcm` is less than or equal to `min_lcm`, that means `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm` regardless of the value of `min_k`. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9; `b` is an integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`; `new_a` is either `a` (if `candidate` is 1) or the nearest multiple of `diff` greater than or equal to `a` (if `candidate` is `diff`); `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is 0; `k` is 1; `candidate` can take values 1 and `diff`; `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`; `current_lcm` is assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
