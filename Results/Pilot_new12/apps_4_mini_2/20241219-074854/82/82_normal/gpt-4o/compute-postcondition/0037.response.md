Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a â‰  b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `k` is `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidates` is `[k, diff // k]`, `new_a` is `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, the current value of `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
