To evaluate the impact of the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the variables and understand how they change after the code execution.

1. In the initial state:
    - `b` is unchanged.
    - `candidate` is `diff // k`.
    - `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
    - Depending on the conditions involving `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k`, either `min_lcm` and `min_k` could potentially be updated, but this impact is not directly stated in the provided context.
    - `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

2. The code `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` indicates that `current_lcm` will be assigned the output of the function `func_2` when called with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments.

Because `current_lcm` is being updated based on the result of the function, we will state this change, while noting that the other variables remain as per their initial definitions.

Output State: **`b` is unchanged; `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
