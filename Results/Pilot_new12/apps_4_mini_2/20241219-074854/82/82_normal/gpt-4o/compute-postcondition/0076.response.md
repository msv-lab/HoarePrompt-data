Output State: **`a` is an integer where `1 <= a <= 10^9`; `b` is an integer where `1 <= b <= 10^9`; `a â‰  b`; `k` is 4; `diff` is at least 4 and a multiple of 4; `candidate` is `diff // 4`; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
