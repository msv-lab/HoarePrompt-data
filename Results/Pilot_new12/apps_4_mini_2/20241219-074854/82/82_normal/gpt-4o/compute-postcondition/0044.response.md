The initial state specifies that `new_b` has been calculated based on `b` and `candidate`, but the values of `new_a` and `new_b` are not provided. The code snippet calls a function `func_2`, passing `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments, resulting in the assignment of `current_lcm` to the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. 

Since `current_lcm` is assigned the result of this function call, its value is updated, but the actual result depends on the implementation of `func_2` and the values of `new_a` and `new_b`, which are unknown. Consequently, `current_lcm` is affected in the output state.

The other variables (`b`, `candidate`, and `new_a` if they remain unchanged) will still retain their initial values.

Output State: **`b` is unchanged, `candidate` is unchanged, `new_a` is unchanged, `current_lcm` is assigned the return value of func_2(new_a, new_b).**
