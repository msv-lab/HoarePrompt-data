The variable `new_b` is assigned the value of `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The value of `candidate` is given as `diff // k`. The effect of the code only alters the value of `new_b` based on the calculation involving `b` and `candidate`. 

Since `b` remains unchanged, the preconditions for `b`, `candidate`, `new_a`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` still hold true, without affecting their values. 

Therefore, the Output State reflects that `new_b` has been determined without changing `b` or any other variables. 

Output State: **`b` is unchanged, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
