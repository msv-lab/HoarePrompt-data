According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`, which contains two elements: `k` (which is 4) and `diff // k` (which is at least 1, since `diff` is at least 4 and a multiple of 4).

At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` would have taken on the value of the first element in the list for the first iteration (`candidate` = 4). 

For the next iteration to occur, the loop will move to the next element in the list. Since the list contains two elements, after iterating with the first element (4), the loop will then iterate with the second element (`diff // k`), which is still valid since it's a result of the division of `diff` (which must be at least 4) and `k` (4). 

Thus, after the first iteration where `candidate` was 4, in the next iteration it will be `diff // k`, and we don't need to change any of the other variables.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a â‰  b`; `k` is 4; `diff` is at least 4 and a multiple of 4; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is now equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `candidate` is equal to `diff // k` (which is valid as per the conditions stated)**
