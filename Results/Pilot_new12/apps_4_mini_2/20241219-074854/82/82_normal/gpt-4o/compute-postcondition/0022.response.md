Postcondition: ***`current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `new_a` and `new_b` remain unchanged. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.***
