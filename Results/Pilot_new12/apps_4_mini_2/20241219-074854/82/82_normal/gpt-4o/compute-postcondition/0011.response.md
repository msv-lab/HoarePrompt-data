To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the initial conditions and the effect of the code. 

Initial State: 
- `a` is an integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9
- `b` is an integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9
- `a` is not equal to `b`
- `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`
- `new_a` could equal `a` when `candidate` is 1, or `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `diff` greater than or equal to `a` when `candidate` is `diff`
- `min_lcm` is equal to `float('inf')`
- `min_k` is 0
- `k` is 1
- `candidate` can take values 1 and `diff`
- `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`

The code snippet:
```
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```
This line invokes the function `func_2` with the arguments `new_a` and `new_b` to calculate `current_lcm`. 

Since `new_a` and `new_b` are not defined in the code provided and their values depend on the values of `candidate`, we will retain the implication of their definitions without explicitly computing them. Specifically:
- If `candidate` is 1, then `new_a` is `a` and `new_b` is the nearest multiple of 1 (which is `b` itself).
- If `candidate` is `diff`, then `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `diff` that's greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` would then be the nearest multiple of `diff` that's greater than or equal to `b`.

The result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` updates `current_lcm`, but since we do not have the exact implementation details of `func_2`, we will not attempt to compute `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9; `b` is an integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`; `new_a` is either `a` (if `candidate` is 1) or the nearest multiple of `diff` greater than or equal to `a` (if `candidate` is `diff`); `min_lcm` is equal to `float('inf')`; `min_k` is 0; `k` is 1; `candidate` can take values 1 and `diff`; `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b` and `current_lcm` is assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
