Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a â‰  b`. If `diff % k == 0`, then `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `k` is 4, and `candidate` takes values 4 and `diff // k`. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are derived from the last `candidate`, `current_lcm` is computed from the last `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated based on minimum LCM conditions evaluated during the loop iterations.***
