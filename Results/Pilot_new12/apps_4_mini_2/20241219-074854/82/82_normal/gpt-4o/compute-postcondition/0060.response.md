The variable `new_b` is assigned the value of `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Given that `candidate` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numeric value for `new_b`. However, we can express `new_b` in relation to `b` and `candidate`. 

- The initial state specifies that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a ≠ b`, `k` is 4, `diff` must be at least 4 and a multiple of 4. 
- The equation used for `new_b` rounds `b` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

Thus, the final output keeps the state of `a`, `b`, and `diff`, and details that `new_b` has been calculated but remains dependent on `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a ≠ b`; `k` is 4; `diff` must be at least 4 and a multiple of 4; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
