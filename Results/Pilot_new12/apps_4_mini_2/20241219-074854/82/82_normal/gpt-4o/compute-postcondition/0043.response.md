To analyze the given code snippet:

`new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`

We can break down the components:

1. **Input Variables**: 
   - `b`: This variable is used in an arithmetic operation but its initial value is not provided, so it remains as is, unspecified.
   - `candidate`: This variable is also used in the operation but does not have an initial value provided either.

2. **Operation**: 
   - The formula `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` computes a new value for `new_b`. 
   - The integer division `//` truncates any decimal places after division.

After executing the code, `new_b` will be calculated based on the values of `b` and `candidate` as follows:
- The term `(b + candidate - 1)` is calculated first.
- This result is then divided by `candidate` using integer division.
- Finally, that result is multiplied back by `candidate`.

Since we do not have specific values for `b` and `candidate`, we can conclude with the following statement:

Output State: **`new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, where `b` and `candidate` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
