The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. Given the constraints that `a` and `b` are both integers between 1 and 10^9 and that `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` will be a positive integer that is less than or equal to \(10^9 - 1\). The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`**.
