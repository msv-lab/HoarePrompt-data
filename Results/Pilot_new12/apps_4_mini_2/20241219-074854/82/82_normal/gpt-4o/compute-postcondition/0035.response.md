To execute the provided Python code, I will look at the variables affected by the code snippet given the Initial State.

### Initial State: 
- `a` is an integer 
- `b` is an integer 
- `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` 
- `a ≠ b` 
- `diff` is `abs(a - b)` 
- `k` is `int(math.sqrt(diff))` 
- `candidates` is `[k, diff // k]` 
- `new_a = (a + k - 1) // k * k` 

The code snippet provided is:
```
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding Candidates**: 
   - `candidates` is a list containing two values: `k` and `diff // k`. The specific value chosen from `candidates` for `candidate` is not provided in the task, but I need to acknowledge that `candidate` can be either `k` or `diff // k`.

2. **Calculation of `new_b`**: 
   - `new_b` is assigned the value calculated with `b` and `candidate`.

3. **Variables Affected**: 
   - The variable `new_b` is influenced directly and assigned a new value. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, and `candidates` remain unaffected.

### Output State Construction:
Given this analysis, since `candidate` can take on values, we can express `new_b` in a general form: 
- If `candidate = k`, then `new_b = (b + k - 1) // k * k`.
- If `candidate = diff // k`, then `new_b = (b + (diff // k) - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)`.

However, without specific values for `b` and the selection of `candidate`, I will represent this generically.

### Final Output State:
The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, and `candidates` remain the same, and we only introduce `new_b` based on the calculation relative to the selected `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a ≠ b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `k` is `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidates` is `[k, diff // k]`, `new_a = (a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` (where candidate can be either `k` or `diff // k`).**
