The value of `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is unchanged; `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.

Output State: **`b` is unchanged; `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
