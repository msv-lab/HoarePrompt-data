The value of `current_lcm` is assigned based on the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, where `new_a` is already calculated and `new_b` is computed based on `b`. The previous values of `new_a` and `new_b`, and their relationship to `a` and `b`, remain valid. `current_lcm` now holds the result from `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a â‰  b`; `k` is 4; `diff` is at least 4 and a multiple of 4; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is now equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
