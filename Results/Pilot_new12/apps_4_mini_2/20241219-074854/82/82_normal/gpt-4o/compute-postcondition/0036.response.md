To evaluate the output state after the given Python code snippet is executed, we begin with the initial state and analyze the impact of the code.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an integer
- `b` is an integer
- `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`
- `a ≠ b`
- `diff` is `abs(a - b)`
- `k` is `int(math.sqrt(diff))`
- `candidates` is `[k, diff // k]`
- `new_a = (a + k - 1) // k * k`
- `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` (where candidate can be either `k` or `diff // k`)

In the provided code, `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. 

Since `func_2` is called with the parameters `new_a` and `new_b`, their calculations and values will directly influence the outcome of `current_lcm`, but we don't have the specific details of what `func_2` computes.

Thus, the specific values of `new_a` and `new_b` will still hold based on their definitions:
- `new_a` is calculated based on `a` and `k`.
- `new_b` is calculated based on `b` and one of the candidates.

The effect on the variables has been encapsulated by the assignment of `current_lcm`, but we have no further information about its specific value or any changes to `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, or `candidates`. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `1 <= a, b <= 10^9, a ≠ b, diff is abs(a - b), k is int(math.sqrt(diff)), candidates is [k, diff // k], new_a is (a + k - 1) // k * k, new_b is (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, current_lcm is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b)**
