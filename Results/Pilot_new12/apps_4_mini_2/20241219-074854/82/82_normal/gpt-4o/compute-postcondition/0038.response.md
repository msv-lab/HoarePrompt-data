The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. Since `current_lcm` is already specified to be less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` under certain conditions (and `min_lcm` is updated only when `current_lcm` is less than it), this means that the previous value of `min_lcm` will now become equal to `current_lcm`, which still satisfies the initial conditions.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a â‰  b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `k` is `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidates` is `[k, diff // k]`, `new_a` is `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
