According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. At the end of the last iteration, we have information about the variables `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `k`, and `diff`.

The loop will continue executing for another time for the second element in the list only if the loop has not yet iterated over both elements (i.e., if there are still elements left to process in the list). 

Since `candidate` is currently assigned one of the elements of the list, it can either be `k` (the first element) or `diff // k` (the second element). There are exactly 2 candidates in the list. If the previous iteration processed the first candidate (`k`), the next iteration will process the second candidate (`diff // k`). 

Given that this is assuming the loop body was executed, we can say:

- If the previous value of `candidate` was `k`, the next value will be `diff // k`.
  
For the loop to continue for the next iteration, since the list has 2 elements, it means that at the start of the next iteration, `candidate` will need to be the second candidate.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers with `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a â‰  b`, current_lcm remains the same, min_lcm remains the same, min_k remains the same, candidate is equal to `diff // k`**
