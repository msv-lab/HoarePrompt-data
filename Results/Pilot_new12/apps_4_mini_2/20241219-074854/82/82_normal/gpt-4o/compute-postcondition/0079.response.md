Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `k`, `diff`, `candidate`, `new_a`, and `new_b` are integers within given ranges. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`.***
