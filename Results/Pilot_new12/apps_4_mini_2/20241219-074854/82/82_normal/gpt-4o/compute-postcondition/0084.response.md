The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers within the range of 1 to 10^9. After executing the function body, the function can return two possible values based on the defined cases. 

In Case 1, the function always returns 0, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. In Case 2, if certain conditions are met, the function returns `min_k`, which is determined during execution of the loop that operates on modified values of `a` and `b`. If the loop does not execute, then `min_k` remains 0, and thus in that case, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and return 0 or `min_k` based on whether the loop is executed or not.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns 0 in all cases or `min_k` if the loop is executed; otherwise, it returns 0 if the loop does not run.**
