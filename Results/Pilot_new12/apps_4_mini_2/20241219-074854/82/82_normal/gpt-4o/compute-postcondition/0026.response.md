In this case, the value of `current_lcm` is assigned the result of calling `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The variables `new_a` and `new_b` are determined by previous calculations based on the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, and `k`. The contents of `current_lcm` depend on the implementation of `func_2`, which cannot be evaluated without further information. Therefore, `current_lcm` is an updated variable, while `b` remains unchanged.

The variables affected by the code execution are `current_lcm`, `new_a`, and `new_b`, which are defined as follows:
- `new_a = (a + (diff // k) - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)`
- `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `candidate = diff // k`

Since we don't know the specific values or the logic inside `func_2`, we can't provide a concrete numerical output for `current_lcm`, but we can note that it has been updated based on the call.

Output State: **`b` is unchanged; `current_lcm` is updated to the return value of `func_2(new_a, new_b); new_a` is calculated as `(a + (diff // k) - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k); `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`.**
