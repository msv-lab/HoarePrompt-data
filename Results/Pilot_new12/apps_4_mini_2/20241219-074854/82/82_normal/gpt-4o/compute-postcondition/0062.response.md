Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a â‰  b`; `k` is 4; `diff` is at least 4 and a multiple of 4; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is computed as `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; the current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or, if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm`, then `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
