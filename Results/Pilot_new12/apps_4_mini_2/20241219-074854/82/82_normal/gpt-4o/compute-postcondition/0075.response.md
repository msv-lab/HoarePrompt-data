Now, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `a` is an integer where `1 <= a <= 10^9`
- `b` is an integer where `1 <= b <= 10^9`
- `a ≠ b`
- `k` is 4
- `diff` is at least 4 and a multiple of 4
- `candidate` is `diff // k`
- `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `current_lcm` is now equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`

### Impact of the Code:
- The line of code executed is:
  ```python
  new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
  ```
- This updates the value of `new_b` based on the current values of `b` and `candidate`.

### Calculation:
1. `new_b` is recalculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{new\_b} = \left( b + \text{candidate} - 1 \right) // \text{candidate} \times \text{candidate}
   \]
   Given that `candidate` is `diff // k`, this means `new_b` will be adjusted to the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Output State:
- `a` remains unchanged as the line of code does not affect it.
- `b` remains unchanged as well.
- `k` remains 4.
- `diff` remains at least 4 and a multiple of 4.
- `candidate` remains `diff // k`.
- `new_a` remains `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `current_lcm` remains equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)` but its value may depend on the new value of `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer where `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `b` is an integer where `1 <= b <= 10^9`, `a ≠ b`, `k` is 4, `diff` is at least 4 and a multiple of 4, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is now `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
