The variable `min_k` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, and `min_lcm` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `float('inf')`; `min_k` is 0.**
