The code snippet assigns the variable `min_lcm` to positive infinity (represented as `float('inf')`). This means it sets `min_lcm` to a value that is greater than any finite number. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `diff` remain unaffected by this operation.

Thus, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `float('inf')`.**
