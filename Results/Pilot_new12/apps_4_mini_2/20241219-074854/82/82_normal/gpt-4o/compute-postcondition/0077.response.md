To evaluate the impact of the code, let’s assess how it affects the existing variables.

- `current_lcm` is assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_lcm` is then assigned the value of `current_lcm`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but `min_lcm` now takes the value of `current_lcm`.

The output state will encapsulate the relevant details regarding the newly updated variable, while maintaining the conditions of the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`a` is an integer where `1 <= a <= 10^9`; `b` is an integer where `1 <= b <= 10^9`; `a ≠ b`; `k` is 4; `diff` is at least 4 and a multiple of 4; `candidate` is `diff // 4`; `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is equal to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
