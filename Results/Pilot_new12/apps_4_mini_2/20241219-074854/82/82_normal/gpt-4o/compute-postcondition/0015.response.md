Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `b` <= 10^9, with `a` not equal to `b` and `diff` equal to `abs(a - b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, `k` is set to 1, `new_a` is either `a` or the nearest multiple of `diff` greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`. If the condition does not hold, the values of `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `k`, `new_a`, and `new_b` remain unchanged.***
