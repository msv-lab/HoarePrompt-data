Let's break down the initial state and the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `a` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 \).
   - `b` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq b \leq 10^9 \).
   - `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - `diff` is equal to \( |a - b| \).
   - `candidate` is equal to \( \text{diff} // k \), where \( k \) is not specified but is assumed to be an integer greater than \( 0 \) since it's used in a division.
   - `new_a` is defined as the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to \( a + candidate - 1 \).

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line of code updates the value of `new_b` to:
     \[
     new\_b = \left( b + candidate - 1 \right) // candidate \times candidate
     \]
   - This expression effectively calculates the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

3. **Variables Affected:**
   - The variable `new_b` will now take on a new value based on the calculation provided.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Final Adjustment of `new_b`:**
   - Given that `candidate` is derived from `diff`, which is \( |a - b| \), and using the properties of integer division and modular arithmetic, we can understand that `new_b` will be a multiple of `candidate` adjusted according to the value of `b`.

Since we do not have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `k`, the result of `new_b` remains expressed in terms of these variables.

**Output State:**
**`a` is an integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9; `b` is an integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is the largest multiple of `candidate` that is less than or equal to `a + candidate - 1`; `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.**
