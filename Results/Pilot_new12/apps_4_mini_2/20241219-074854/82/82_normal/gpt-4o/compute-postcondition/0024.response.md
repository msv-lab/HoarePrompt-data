The variable `new_a` is assigned the result of the expression `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Here, `a` remains unchanged, and `candidate` is defined as `diff // k`. 

The new value of `new_a` depends on the values of `a`, `diff`, and `k`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the change in `new_a`.

Output State: **`current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `new_b` is unchanged; `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`; `new_a` is equal to `(a + (diff // k) - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)`.**
