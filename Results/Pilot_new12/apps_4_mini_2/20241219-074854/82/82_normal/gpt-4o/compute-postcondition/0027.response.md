Output State: **`b` is unchanged; `current_lcm` is updated to the return value of `func_2(new_a, new_b); new_a` is calculated as `(a + (diff // k) - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k); `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
