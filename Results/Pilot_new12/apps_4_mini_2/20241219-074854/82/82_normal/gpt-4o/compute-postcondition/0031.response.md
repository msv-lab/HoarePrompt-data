Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`. If `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, where `new_a` is a multiple of one of the candidates based on `a`, and `new_b` is a multiple of one of the candidates based on `b`, while `min_k` is the candidate that gives `min_lcm`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
