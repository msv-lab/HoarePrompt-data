Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers with `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a â‰  b`. `min_lcm` is the least common multiple determined by the optimal candidates derived from the values of `k` and `diff // k`. `min_k` is the candidate that provided the minimum `current_lcm`. The loop executed for 2 iterations, evaluating candidates based on `k` and `diff // k`. If no candidates yield a valid `current_lcm`, then `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their initialized states.**
