To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we should analyze the `candidate` variable and the structure of the loop. The loop iterates over a list comprised of the values `[k, diff // k]`, and `candidate` is assigned each value in that list in subsequent iterations.

If at the end of the previous iteration, `candidate` has already taken the value of the first element in the list (which is `k`), the next iteration will assign `candidate` the second element (which is `diff // k`). 

Assuming `candidate` is currently `k`, after the current iteration finishes, `candidate` will move to `diff // k` for the next iteration.

Now we must consider the loop's condition, which doesn't directly have constraints on `candidate`, but simply dictates the iteration over the list.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `candidate` to `diff // k`.

State: **`current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `new_a` and `new_b` remain unchanged; `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`.**
