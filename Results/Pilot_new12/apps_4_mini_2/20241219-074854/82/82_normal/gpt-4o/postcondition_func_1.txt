The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters, `x` and `y`, both within the range of 1 to 10^9. It computes the product of `x` and `y` and divides that product by the result of calling another function, `func_1(x, y)`. The function ultimately returns the integer quotient of this division. It assumes that `func_1(x, y)` will return a value greater than zero in order to avoid division by zero, but this assumption is not checked in the code, presenting a potential edge case. If `func_1(x, y)` returns zero for any input values of `x` and `y`, this will lead to a runtime error.
