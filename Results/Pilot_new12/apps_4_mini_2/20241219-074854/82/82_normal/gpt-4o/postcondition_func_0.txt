The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are expected to be between 1 and 10^9. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop, the function ensures `y` is 0, and the returned value of `x` is the GCD of the original input values. The annotations indicate that if `y` is initially non-zero, the loop executes, confirming the GCD computation completes correctly. If `y` is zero initially, the loop does not execute, and `x` is returned unchanged. However, the provided range for `y` (1 to 10^9) means `y` should never be zero when passed, which is a point not addressed in the annotations. Therefore, the function reliably returns the GCD without handling cases where `y` might be zero since itâ€™s assumed to be within defined constraints.
