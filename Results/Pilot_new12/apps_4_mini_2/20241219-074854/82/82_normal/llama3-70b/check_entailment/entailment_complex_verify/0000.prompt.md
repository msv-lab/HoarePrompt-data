You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement the logic required to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` only compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM respectively, but they do not attempt to find the optimal \( k \) as stated in the problem description.

For example, consider the input \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \). The program does not evaluate any values of \( k \). Instead, the program demonstrates an incomplete solution, as it calculates values of LCM without considering the variable \( k \). 

To illustrate the failure, the correct \( k \) for the input \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \) would be found by checking \( LCM(6+k, 10+k) \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \) until an optimal solution is found. However, such logic is missing in the provided implementation. In summary, the absence of logic to minimize the LCM over valid \( k \) makes this implementation incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0. Therefore, the program returns 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are constrained to be in the range from 1 to 10^9. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the while loop, the value of `b` will be 0, and the function will return `a`, which now holds the GCD of the two input values. The function effectively handles the case where `b` becomes zero during the GCD calculation and correctly returns the GCD even if initially `b` is greater than `a`. Since there are no cases where `b` starts at zero, it does not need to handle that explicitly. Thus, the final state after the program execution reflects that the return value is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of a multiplied by b, divided by the value returned from the function func_1(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. It returns the value of `a` multiplied by `b`, divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function does not handle any exceptions or errors that may arise from the operation, such as a zero return value from `func_1`, which could lead to division by zero. Therefore, the final state can lead to an error if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero. The annotations accurately summarize the main functionality but do not address potential edge cases regarding the return value of `func_1`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
