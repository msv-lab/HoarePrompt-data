The provided code aims to solve the problem of finding the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. 

Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( a \) and \( b \). The implementation appears to correctly do this using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is essential for calculating the LCM.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function computes the LCM of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
   The implementation seems to be correct in this respect. However, there is a critical issue to address: if both \( a \) and \( b \) are zero, which should not happen based on the constraints (1 ≤ \( a, b \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)), mathematically, LCM(0, 0) is undefined. However, given the problem constraints, we can assume the inputs are valid, and division by zero shouldn't occur in the provided range.

3. **Main logic**:
   - The main loop starts with \( k = 0 \) and computes the LCM for \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). It continues incrementing \( k \) as long as the new LCM is less than the minimum LCM found so far. 
   - It breaks the loop once the LCM does not decrease anymore, then returns \( k - 1 \). This could cause an issue if the minimum LCM is found specifically when \( k \) is 0 but fails to count it properly when breaking the loop.

4. **Output hints**:
    - The hints indicate that the program attempts to find the minimum LCM iteratively, which does not seem to guarantee that it checks all necessary \( k \) values for all edge cases that might produce the minimum LCM. 

Overall, the code does not ensure that it searches exhaustively for the optimal \( k \). For instance, it fails to account for cases where skipping potential values of \( k \) leads to missing the smallest LCM. 

A possible case where the program could fail:
- For \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 1 \), the output should be \( k = 0 \) since LCM(1, 1) = 1, but if it incorrectly increments or skips checks, it might not find the correct result.

Thus, even though the code functions correctly in several cases, it does not guarantee finding the correct output for every possible configuration of \( a \) and \( b \).

Correctness: **False**.
