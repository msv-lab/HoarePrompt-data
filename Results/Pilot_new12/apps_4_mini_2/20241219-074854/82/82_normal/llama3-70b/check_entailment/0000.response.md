Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement the logic required to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` only compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM respectively, but they do not attempt to find the optimal \( k \) as stated in the problem description.

For example, consider the input \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \). The program does not evaluate any values of \( k \). Instead, the program demonstrates an incomplete solution, as it calculates values of LCM without considering the variable \( k \). 

To illustrate the failure, the correct \( k \) for the input \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \) would be found by checking \( LCM(6+k, 10+k) \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \) until an optimal solution is found. However, such logic is missing in the provided implementation. In summary, the absence of logic to minimize the LCM over valid \( k \) makes this implementation incorrect.
