To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its annotations in relation to the requirements set out in the problem.

### Problem Description Recap
Neko needs to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. If multiple such \( k \) exist, the smallest one should be returned.

### Code Overview
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( a \) and \( b \) using the Euclidean algorithm. 
   - The function handles the cases correctly as per the constraints \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9 \).
   - There are no edge cases for zero inputs since both \( a \) and \( b \) are guaranteed to be positive.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**: Computes the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) using the relation \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).
   - The main logic here is also sound as it properly calculates the LCM using the GCD from `func_1`.
   - However, there's a risk of division by zero if `func_1` happens to return zero, which theoretically won't happen here, but without proper handling, this could lead to runtime errors in other use cases.

3. **Main logic with the `while True` loop**: The code iterates over increasing values of \( k \), starting from zero, computing the LCM for \( a+k \) and \( b+k \).
   - It continues until it finds a non-decreasing LCM, thus ensuring that it finds the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM.

### Key Concerns
- While analyzing the fast loop for \( k \), the program will only stop when it detects an increase in LCM. This approach may overlook some potential cases where valid smaller \( k \) values may exist leading to minimal LCM further on.
- The calculations within `func_2` do not directly consider the smallest \( k \) correctly because potential optimal \( k \) values (those that yield the same minimal LCM) may not be correctly captured if the program breaks on the first non-decreasing condition, meaning it might not check the necessary range exhaustively enough.

### Edge Cases
1. **When \( a = b \)**: If both inputs are the same, \( k = 0 \) should always yield an LCM that is the smallest since \( LCM(a,a) = a \). 
2. **Non-decreasing scenarios**: The program might simply stop without processing potential optimal solutions preceding the point where the least LCM occurs.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the provided implementation of the program fails to guarantee that the smallest \( k \) is found in every potential case, especially in scenarios where LCM values can have local minima.

Thus, based on this analysis, we can state that:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not ensure that it finds the correct minimal \( k \) across every scenario, especially considering cases of potentially equal LCM values at various \( k \) adjustments.
