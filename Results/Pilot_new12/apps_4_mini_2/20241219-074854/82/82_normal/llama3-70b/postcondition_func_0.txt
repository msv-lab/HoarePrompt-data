The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are constrained to be in the range from 1 to 10^9. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the while loop, the value of `b` will be 0, and the function will return `a`, which now holds the GCD of the two input values. The function effectively handles the case where `b` becomes zero during the GCD calculation and correctly returns the GCD even if initially `b` is greater than `a`. Since there are no cases where `b` starts at zero, it does not need to handle that explicitly. Thus, the final state after the program execution reflects that the return value is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
