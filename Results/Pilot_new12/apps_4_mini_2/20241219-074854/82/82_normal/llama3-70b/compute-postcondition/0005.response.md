The code `a, b = b, a % b` swaps the values of `a` and `b` and updates `b` to be the remainder of the division of the previous value of `a` by the previous value of `b`. Given that `a` is not divisible by the previous value of `b`, `a % b` will result in a non-zero value. 

Since `a` equals the previous value of `b`, let's denote the previous values as:
- Let `prev_b` be the previous value of `b`
- Let `prev_a` be the previous value of `a`

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `a` will take the value of `prev_b`
- `b` will take the value of `prev_a % prev_b`

This indicates that the new value of `b` is the remainder of `prev_a` divided by `prev_b`, which is non-zero.

Output State: **`a` equals the previous value of `b`, `b` equals the previous value of `a` modulo the previous value of `b`, and `a` is not divisible by the previous value of `b`**.
