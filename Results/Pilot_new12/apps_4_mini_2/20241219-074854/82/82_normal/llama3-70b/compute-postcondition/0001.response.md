The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers with values in the range of 1 to 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b` and then dividing that product by the value returned from another function, `func_1(a, b)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and return the result of their multiplication divided by the output of `func_1(a, b)`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers, a and b, and returns the result of a multiplied by b divided by the value returned from func_1(a, b).**
