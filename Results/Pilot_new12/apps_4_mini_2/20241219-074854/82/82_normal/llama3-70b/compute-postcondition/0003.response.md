To analyze the given code snippet:

1. The line `a, b = b, a % b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`.
2. The new value of `a` will be set to the previous value of `b`, and the new value of `b` will be the remainder of the previous value of `a` divided by the previous value of `b`.
3. Considering that `b` is not equal to 0 (as `a` must not be divisible by `b`), the modulo operation will yield a valid result.
4. The values of `a` and `b` will change as per the calculations defined in the operation.

Now let's summarize the previous conditions and the new conditions after executing the code:

- `a` will now hold the value of `b` (the previous value).
- `b` will now hold the value of the previous `a` modulo the previous `b`.

The output state will thus indicate the new values of `a` and `b`, while keeping the conditions of `a` not being divisible by the previous `b`.

Output State: **`a` equals the previous value of `b`, `b` equals the previous value of `a` modulo the previous value of `b` and `a` is not divisible by the previous value of `b` (which ensures `b` remains greater than 0).**
