According to the code, the loop continues as long as `b` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, we know `a` equals the previous value of `b`, and `b` equals the previous value of `a` modulo the previous value of `b`, with the additional information that `a` is not divisible by the previous value of `b` (which guarantees that `b` remains greater than 0).

Since `b` is currently non-zero, the loop can certainly execute one more time under those conditions. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary, as `b` remains valid for another iteration.

State: **`a` equals the previous value of `b`, `b` equals the previous value of `a` modulo the previous value of `b`, and `a` is not divisible by the previous value of `b`**
