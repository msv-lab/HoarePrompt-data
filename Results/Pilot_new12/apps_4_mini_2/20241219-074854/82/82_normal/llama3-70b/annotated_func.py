#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0. Therefore, the program returns 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are constrained to be in the range from 1 to 10^9. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the while loop, the value of `b` will be 0, and the function will return `a`, which now holds the GCD of the two input values. The function effectively handles the case where `b` becomes zero during the GCD calculation and correctly returns the GCD even if initially `b` is greater than `a`. Since there are no cases where `b` starts at zero, it does not need to handle that explicitly. Thus, the final state after the program execution reflects that the return value is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the result of a multiplied by b, divided by the value returned from the function func_1(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. It returns the value of `a` multiplied by `b`, divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function does not handle any exceptions or errors that may arise from the operation, such as a zero return value from `func_1`, which could lead to division by zero. Therefore, the final state can lead to an error if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero. The annotations accurately summarize the main functionality but do not address potential edge cases regarding the return value of `func_1`.
