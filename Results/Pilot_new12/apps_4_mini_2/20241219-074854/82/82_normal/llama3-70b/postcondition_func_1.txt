The function accepts two positive integers, `a` and `b`, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. It returns the value of `a` multiplied by `b`, divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function does not handle any exceptions or errors that may arise from the operation, such as a zero return value from `func_1`, which could lead to division by zero. Therefore, the final state can lead to an error if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero. The annotations accurately summarize the main functionality but do not address potential edge cases regarding the return value of `func_1`.
