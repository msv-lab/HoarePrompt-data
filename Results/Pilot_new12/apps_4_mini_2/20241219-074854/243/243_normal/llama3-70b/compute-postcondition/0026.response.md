The value of the variables does not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the smallest integer such that `2` divided by `5` raised to the power of `count` is less than `m`, `n` is 2, and `ans` is [1], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
