Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to continue executing indefinitely unless there is a break statement within the loop body that is triggered. Therefore, there is no condition that needs to be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`m` is an input integer, `count` is 1, and `n` is 1**
