The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The value of `m` is an input integer, and `n` is 1, which means that `n // 5` results in 0 because integer division of 1 by 5 yields 0. Since the condition is not satisfied (0 is not greater than or equal to 1), `count` must be incremented regardless. Therefore, the output state updates `count` to 1 while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `count` is 1, and `n` is 1**
