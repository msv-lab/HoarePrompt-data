The variable `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables `count` and `n` remain unchanged. The output state thus includes the unchanged conditions of the initial state along with the new value of `ans`.

Output State: **`count` is the smallest integer such that `n` divided by 5 raised to the power of `count` is less than `m`; `n` is 1; `ans` is an empty list**.
