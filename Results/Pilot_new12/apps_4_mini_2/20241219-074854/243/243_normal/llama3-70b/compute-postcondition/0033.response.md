The code `ans.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`. Given that `n` is 3, `ans` will now contain 3 as an additional element.

The initial state is:
- `count` is the smallest integer such that `2` divided by `5` raised to the power of `count` is less than `m`
- `n` is 3
- `ans` is [1, 2]

After executing the code, the updated state of `ans` is [1, 2, 3]. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is the smallest integer such that `2` divided by `5` raised to the power of `count` is less than `m`, `n` is 3, and `ans` is [1, 2, 3]**
