The variable `count` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `count` is not known, we cannot specify the exact new value. However, the only change is the increment operation. The other variables retain their original states. Therefore, the output state reflects that `count` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is increased by 1**
