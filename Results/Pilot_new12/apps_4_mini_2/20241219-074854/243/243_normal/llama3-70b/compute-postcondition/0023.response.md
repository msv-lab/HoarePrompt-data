The operation `ans.append(n)` adds the current value of `n` to the list `ans`. The variable `n` is currently equal to 1, which means that `1` will be appended to the `ans` list. The values of other variables `count` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the output state will be: `count` is the smallest integer such that `n` divided by 5 raised to the power of `count` is less than `m`, `n` is 1, and `ans` is a list containing the value 1.

Output State: **`count` is the smallest integer such that `n` divided by 5 raised to the power of `count` is less than `m`, `n` is 1, and `ans` is [1]**.
