Output State: **`count` is the smallest integer such that `1` divided by `5` raised to the power of `count` is less than `m`, `n` is equal to the final value before the loop condition failed, and `ans` contains all values from 1 up to that final value of `n - 1`. If the loop executes at least once, then `m` must be greater than 0.**
