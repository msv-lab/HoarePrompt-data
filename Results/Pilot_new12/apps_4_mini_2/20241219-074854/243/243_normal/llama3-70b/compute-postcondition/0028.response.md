The code `ans.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since `n` is currently equal to `2`, the value appended to `ans` will be `2`. Therefore, `ans` will now contain two elements: `1` (the initial value) and `2` (the value of `n`).

The states of the other variables, including `count` and `m`, are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`count` is the smallest integer such that `2` divided by `5` raised to the power of `count` is less than `m`, `n` is 2, and `ans` is [1, 2].**
