`n` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is 1, so now `n` becomes 2. The other variables, `count` and `ans`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the smallest integer such that `2` divided by `5` raised to the power of `count` is less than `m`, `n` is 2, and `ans` is [1].

Output State: **`count` is the smallest integer such that `2` divided by `5` raised to the power of `count` is less than `m`, `n` is 2, and `ans` is [1]**.
