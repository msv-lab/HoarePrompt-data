In this case, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely until a break condition is met within the body of the loop. There are no conditions under which the loop will not execute again because it inherently continues as long as the program runs. 

Since there is no explicit condition that prevents the loop from continuing, the program state at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated unchanged. 

State: **`m` is an input integer, `count` is 2, `n` is 1**
