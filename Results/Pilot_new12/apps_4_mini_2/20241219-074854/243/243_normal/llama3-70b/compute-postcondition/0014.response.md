Postcondition: ***If `n // 5 ** count` is greater than or equal to `m`, then the loop or statement is exited. Since `count` is fixed at 2 and `n` is 1, this implies that the condition evaluates to `1 // 5 ** 2 >= m` which simplifies to `1 // 25 >= m`. In this case, if `m` is less than or equal to 0, we exit, otherwise, if `m` is greater than 0, the loop continues as there is no else part. Therefore, `m` is an integer, `count` is 2, and `n` is 1.***
