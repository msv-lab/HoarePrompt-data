Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it fails to correctly determine and count the numbers of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. 

### Issues Identified:
1. **Trailing Zero Calculation Failures**:
   - The program correctly tries to find the highest power of 5 that contributes to the trailing zeros but does not accurately compute how many integers have exactly `m` trailing zeroes in their factorial.
   - The logic surrounding counting the integers whose factorials yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes is flawed. The current implementation only accumulates numbers without checking if they yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

2. **Failed Example**:
   - If we take an input like `m = 5`, the program outputs `0` correctly, but it should also handle cases to check for numbers that provide trailing zeroes accurately within a relevant range.
   - For `m = 1`, based on the constraints of the problem, the correct output should indeed include numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, since these factorials end with exactly 1 zero. The current logic implemented does not ensure this is done accurately.

These issues indicate that while the program attempts the problem, it ultimately does not resolve it correctly for every input case, resulting in inconsistencies in the required output. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
