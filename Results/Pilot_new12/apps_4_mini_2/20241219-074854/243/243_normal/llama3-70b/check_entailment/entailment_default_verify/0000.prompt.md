You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Program:
```
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count >= m:
            break
        count += 1
    n = 1
    ans = []
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count < m:
            break
        ans.append(n)
        n += 1
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the logic and identify potential issues.

**Problem Summary:**
We need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial of \( n \) ends with exactly \( m \) zeroes. 

**Understanding the Code:**
1. The first `while True` loop calculates how many factors of 5 contribute to trailing zeroes in \( n! \). The loop breaks when \( n // 5^{count} \) becomes equal to or exceeds \( m \).
2. The second `while True` loop seeks to find the integers \( n \) such that the number of trailing zeroes is exactly \( m \). It adds \( n \) to the answer list until the condition \( n // 5^{count} < m \) is met.

**Identifying Issues:**
- The first loop can potentially not find the correct value of \( count \) for high values of \( n \) since it progresses until it has found a condition where \( n // 5^{count} \geq m \), but it might overshoot if \( n \) is not sufficiently incremented. This can lead to an insufficient number of trailing zeroes being counted.
- The second loop, which attempts to find valid \( n \), doesn't seem to correctly account for the case where there isn't a continuous sequence of numbers that produces exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. Based on the example given in the problem description, it seems that for certain values of \( m \), it cannot return the expected \( n \) values.
- Specifically, the logic for collecting integers \( n \) seems flawed. For instance, if \( m \) is high and \( n \) does not yield any integers whose factorial has exactly \( m \) zeroes (like the case for \( m = 5 \)), the logic fails to correctly represent that result (it returns 0 integer outputs incorrectly).

**Test Cases:**
- For \( m = 5 \), the correct output should be 0, but the current logic does not guarantee that this scenario is managed properly by its counting logic.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes a positive integer input `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000) and performs two primary tasks. Firstly, it calculates the smallest integer `count` such that \(1 / 5^{count} < m\). In practical terms, it finds the highest power of 5 that divides into `m`. Secondly, it constructs a list `ans` that includes all integers from 1 up to the value where \(n / 5^{count} < m\). The final output of the function is the length of this list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` printed in a single line. Thus, the function effectively retains the sequence of integers up to a limit determined by the relationship of `m` with the powers of 5, and informs the user of how many such integers exist, along with listing them. Note that the code assumes proper input and does not handle any edge cases for invalid input types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
