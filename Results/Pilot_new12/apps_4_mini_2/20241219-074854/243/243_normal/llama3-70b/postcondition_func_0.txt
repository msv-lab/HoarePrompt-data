The function takes a positive integer input `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000) and performs two primary tasks. Firstly, it calculates the smallest integer `count` such that \(1 / 5^{count} < m\). In practical terms, it finds the highest power of 5 that divides into `m`. Secondly, it constructs a list `ans` that includes all integers from 1 up to the value where \(n / 5^{count} < m\). The final output of the function is the length of this list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` printed in a single line. Thus, the function effectively retains the sequence of integers up to a limit determined by the relationship of `m` with the powers of 5, and informs the user of how many such integers exist, along with listing them. Note that the code assumes proper input and does not handle any edge cases for invalid input types.
