The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where `n` is at least 1) and returns the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`). It calculates this by counting the total number of factors of 5 present in the numbers from 1 to `n`, since each pair of factors of 2 and 5 contribute to a trailing zero, and factors of 2 are more abundant than factors of 5 in factorials. The calculation iteratively sums the integer division of `n` by increasing powers of 5 until the power of 5 exceeds `n`. The return value is the accumulated count of these factors. There is no explicit handling of cases where `n` is less than 1, but per the function's precondition, it is assumed that `n` is always a valid positive integer.
