The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `m` where \( 1 \leq m \leq 100000 \) and returns a list of integers such that the factorial of each integer in that list ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The function performs a binary search to determine the range of integers whose factorials yield the desired trailing zero count. If no integers meet this criteria, the function will return an empty list. The function also handles edge cases, such as when there are no integers with `m` trailing zeroes. The final state of the function is that it will return a list containing those integers in the specified range or an empty list if no such integers exist.
