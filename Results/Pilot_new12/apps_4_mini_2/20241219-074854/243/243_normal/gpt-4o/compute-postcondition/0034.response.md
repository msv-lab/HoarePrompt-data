The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, which represents the midpoint of the range defined by `low` and `high`. Since `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, the value of `mid` will be a non-negative integer that falls between `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 

`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
