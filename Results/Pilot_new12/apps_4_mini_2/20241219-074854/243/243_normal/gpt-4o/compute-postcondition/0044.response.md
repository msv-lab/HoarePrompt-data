To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition provided in the `while` statement. The loop will continue to run as long as `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`.

Given the final states:
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000,
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`,
- `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2,
- `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`,
- `result` is an empty list,
- `left` is decreased by 1.

The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `left` has just been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute once more, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m`. This means we need `left` to have a value such that `func_1(left)` returns `m`.

Since `left` has been decreased by 1, for the next iteration, `left` must need to be a value where `func_1(left)` continues to equal `m`. Specifically, the value of `left` must have been at least 1 unit value more so that the result of `func_1` remains `m`. 

As such, we must ensure that `left` (before the decrement) was a value such that `func_1(left - 1)` also equals `m`. Hence, the modification needed here is that to indicate this, we will need to state that `left` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the adjusted states will reflect that condition. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, and left must be greater than or equal to 2**
