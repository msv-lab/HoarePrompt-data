To determine if the loop can execute, we need to evaluate the condition `func_1(right) == m`. The state right before the loop provides that `right` is equal to `mid + 1`. 

Since `func_1(left)` equals `m` and `func_1(left + 1)` is not equal to `m`, it suggests that there exists at least one value of `right` that could satisfy the loop condition `func_1(right) == m`. 

However, we need to ensure that the state of `right` is valid for the function application in order to potentially execute the loop again. In particular, we don't know what `func_1` returns when input `right` is evaluated. 

For the loop to execute at least once, it is essential to have `func_1(right)` equal to `m`. Given `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, we may need to ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m` by adjusting the state of `right`.

Thus, we can conclude that `right` needs to be set to a value such that `func_1(right)` returns `m`.

State: **`left` is equal to the maximum value such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, `func_1(left + 1)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `right` must be adjusted so that `func_1(right) = m`**
