The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or conditional structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State retains the previous values of all relevant variables while acknowledging the break in execution flow.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is between 10 and 500005; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`; `left` remains unchanged; `right` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
