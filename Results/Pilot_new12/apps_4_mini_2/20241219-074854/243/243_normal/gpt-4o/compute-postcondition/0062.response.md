The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` was less than or equal to `high`. The values of `m`, `high`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged and are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`, `high` remains unchanged; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.**
