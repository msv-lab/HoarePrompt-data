The variables `low` and `high` are assigned new values. Specifically, `low` is set to `0`, and `high` is calculated as `5 * (m + 1)`. Given that `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\), we can state that \(m + 1\) ranges from \(2\) to \(100001\), making \(5 * (m + 1)\) range from \(10\) to \(500005\). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005.**
