Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 - 1, and `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.**
