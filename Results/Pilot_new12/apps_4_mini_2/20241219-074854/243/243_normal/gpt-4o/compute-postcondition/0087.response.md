The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `m`. `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000. After executing the function body, it returns a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `low` is greater than `high`, and contains these integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `m` and return a list of integers within a specific range based on the conditions relating to `left`, `right`, `low`, and `high`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `m`, and returns a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` when `low` is greater than `high`.**
