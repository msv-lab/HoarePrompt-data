The line of code initializes `result` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of the other variables in the initial state, which remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list.**
