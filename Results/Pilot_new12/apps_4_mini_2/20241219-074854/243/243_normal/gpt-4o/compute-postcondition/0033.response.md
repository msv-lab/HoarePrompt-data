In the provided state, the loop condition `low <= high` determines whether the loop can execute again. The existing variables that affect the loop are `low`, `high`, and their respective updates based on the `zeroes` and `m`.

1. The conditions mention that `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)` and is currently less than `m`. Thus, based on the first condition, `low` is updated to `high // 2 + 1`, meaning `low` is now greater than `mid`. Given that `high` remains between 10 and 500005, and `low` needs to be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to continue, if `low` is now greater than `mid`, then `high` must be adjusted.

2. Since `zeroes` is specifically less than `m`, if `low` has been updated, we must ensure that this does not create an invalid range where `low > high`. Therefore, we need to do two things:
   - Adjust `high` to be greater than or equal to `low` or manage `low` based on the last computed `high`.
   - Maintain `zeroes` being less than `m`.

From these considerations, we find that `low` needs to potentially be modified so that it does not exceed `high` after its last update.

Thus for the loop to iterate one more time:

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**.
