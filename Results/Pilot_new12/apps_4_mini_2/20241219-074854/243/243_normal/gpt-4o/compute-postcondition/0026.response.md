To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we look at the condition `func_1(right) == m`. 

From the provided state:
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000,
- `low` is 0,
- `high` is between 10 and 500005,
- `mid` is equal to `high // 2`,
- `result` is an empty list,
- `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`,
- `left` has been decremented by the number of loop iterations,
- `right` has been increased by 1.

For the loop to execute at least one more time, the condition `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`. However, since `right` is increased by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure that `func_1(right + 1) == m` or whichever value `right` needs to assume for the condition to be true.

In conclusion, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need:
- `func_1(right)` should remain equal to `m` after incrementing `right`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `right` so that it reflects a value for which `func_1(right)` is exactly `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`, `left` is the last value for which func_1(left) equaled `m` and has been decremented by the number of loop iterations, `right` must be adjusted so that func_1(right) equals m.**
