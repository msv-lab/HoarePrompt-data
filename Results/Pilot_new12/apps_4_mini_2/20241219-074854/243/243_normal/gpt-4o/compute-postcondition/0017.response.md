The value of `left` is decremented by 1. Other variables remain unchanged, but `left`'s value has decreased. The other preconditions still apply, specifically that `m` remains a positive integer and `low`, `high`, `mid`, `result`, and `zeroes` maintain their original conditions as specified.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`, `left` is decreased by 1, and func_1(left + 1) must equal m**
