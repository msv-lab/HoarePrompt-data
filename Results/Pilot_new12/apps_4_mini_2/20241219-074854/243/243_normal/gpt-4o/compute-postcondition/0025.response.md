Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`, `left` is the last value for which func_1(left) equaled `m` and has been decremented by the number of loop iterations, `right` has been increased by 1.**
