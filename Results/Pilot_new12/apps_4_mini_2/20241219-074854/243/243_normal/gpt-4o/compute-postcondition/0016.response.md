To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` loop condition, which is `func_1(left) == m`. The loop can continue as long as this condition is met.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000
- `low` is 0
- `high` is between 10 and 500005
- `mid` is equal to `high // 2`
- `result` is an empty list
- `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)` and less than or equal to `m`
- `left` is decremented by 1 (let's denote the value of `left` before decrement as `left + 1`)

For the loop to continue running, the value of `left` has just been decremented which implies that now `func_1(left)` needs to equal `m` for the loop to execute again.

Since `left` has been decremented, we need to ensure that `func_1(left)` (which would be the current value after decrementing `left`) still returns `m`. Therefore, after incrementing `left` back by 1 (to its original value), we need to find a condition for `func_1` that ensures it returns `m`.

1. Since `func_1(left)` needs to equal `m`, the loop can execute again if `left` is such that `func_1(left) == m` holds true.
2. Given that `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)` and less than or equal to `m`, we may need to deduce that `func_1(left + 1)` should ideally also equal `m` for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the required conditions for the `left` variable need to be established — specifically, the relation between the `func_1(left + 1)` and `m`.

Thus, the resulting state is:

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`, and `func_1(left + 1) must equal m`**.
