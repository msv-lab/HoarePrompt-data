To determine the necessary adjustments for the while loop to execute, let's analyze the conditions given in the program state.

The loop condition is `while func_1(right) == m`. Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, the function `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`. 

From the states provided:
- `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000.
- `right` is equal to `mid + 1`.
- `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)` and is less than or equal to `m`.

Since `right` is initiated as `mid + 1`, we must ensure that when calling `func_1(right)`, the return value must be equal to `m` for the loop to execute. 

To guarantee that this condition is met, we can suggest that `func_1(right)` needs to be adjusted to return `m`. If it does not currently return `m`, then we can't proceed with the first iteration of the loop.

Since the given states imply that `func_1(right)` could potentially return a value less than `m`, one appropriate modification could be specifying that `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m` to facilitate the loop's execution.

Thus, we conclude the necessary adjustment for the loop condition to be satisfied.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`, `left` is the last value for which func_1(left) equaled `m` and has been decremented by the number of loop iterations, `right` is equal to mid + 1, and func_1(right) must equal m**.
