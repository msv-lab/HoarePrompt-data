The code assigns `low` the value of `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, this means that `low` will now be half of `high` plus 1. The other variables retain their values. Therefore the output state is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is `mid + 1` (which is `high // 2 + 1`); `high` is between 10 and 500005; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and the current value of `zeroes` is less than `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is equal to `high // 2 + 1`; `high` is between 10 and 500005; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and the current value of `zeroes` is less than `m`.**
