The value of `left` is decremented by 1. Since `left` was not explicitly given in the initial state, but it can be inferred that `left` is defined such that `func_1(left + 1)` equals `m`, the specific value of `left` cannot be determined. However, it remains valid that `left` will now be one less than its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is decreased by 1.**
