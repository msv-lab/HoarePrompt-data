The variable `high` is updated to the value of `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, this means `high` is now one less than the middle value between `low` and `high`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state includes the updated value of `high` and retains the definitions of the other variables. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, and `high` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.**
