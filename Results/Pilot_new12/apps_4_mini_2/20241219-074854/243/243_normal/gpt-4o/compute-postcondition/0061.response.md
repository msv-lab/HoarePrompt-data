The code assigns the value of `zeroes` to the output of the function `func_1` when called with `mid` as the argument. The current value of `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`. Since `m` is a positive integer and within the specified range, and the relationship `low <= high` is maintained, the other variables maintain their conditions.

However, we cannot predict the specific return value of `zeroes` since it is the output of `func_1(mid)`, which is dependent on the implementation of `func_1`. Therefore, we express `zeroes` as the result of that function call.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`**.
