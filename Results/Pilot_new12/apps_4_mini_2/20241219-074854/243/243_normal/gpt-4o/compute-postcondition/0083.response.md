Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `left` remains the maximum value such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, `func_1(left + 1)` is not equal to `m`, and `right` is adjusted to ensure `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`. The result is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.***
