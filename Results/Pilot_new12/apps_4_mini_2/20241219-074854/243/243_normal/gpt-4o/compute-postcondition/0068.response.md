In this scenario, the execution of the loop is contingent upon the condition `func_1(left) == m`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `m` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 100000 \).
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.
- `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(left)` must still be true at the beginning of the next iteration. This means that `left`, which is one less than `mid`, must produce the same output when passed to `func_1`.

Given that `func_1(left)` currently equals `m`, for the loop to execute again, it must also be true at the next iteration that:

1. The value of `left` must not change its resulting value when passed to `func_1`, meaning `left` likely needs adjusting based on the behavior of `func_1` in relation to `m`. 

Since we currently don't know how exactly `func_1` will behave with increments or decrements in `left`, we can't specify anything definitive regarding the values of `low`, `high`, or even `left` without more information about `func_1`. Nevertheless, we can infer that `left` must remain such that `func_1(left)` still equals `m`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we can state that we need `func_1(left)` to remain equal to `m`. The simplest adjustment will be to specify that `left` must be one of those values that keeps `func_1(left) == m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` still equals `m`.**
