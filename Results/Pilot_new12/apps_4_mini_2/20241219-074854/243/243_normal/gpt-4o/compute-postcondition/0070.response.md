According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `left`. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(left)` must still return `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `left` was decreased by 1, and `func_1(left)` still equals `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be at least equal to the smallest value that still causes `func_1(left)` to return `m`.

Since `left` has been decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, it cannot be decreased further unless the function `func_1` is designed such that it still returns `m` for the new value of `left`. To ensure that `func_1(left)` returns `m` after `left` has been decreased from its previous value, we must affirm that the value of `left` remains at a point at which `func_1` can still return `m`.

In this context, we note that since `left` has already been modified, there must exist a `left` value that when decreased by one still allows `func_1(left)` to return `m`. Therefore, we need to specify that we must have `func_1(left - 1)` still equal to `m` for the loop to execute again, which implicitly requires that `left` must currently be a value such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. 

Thus, based on this analysis:

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is currently such that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` and `func_1(left - 1)` must also equal `m`.**
