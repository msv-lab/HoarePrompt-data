Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; if `zeroes` is less than `m`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, with `zeroes` reflecting the value returned by `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Additionally, if `zeroes` equals `m`, `left` is the maximum value such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, `func_1(left + 1)` is not equal to `m`, and `right` is adjusted to ensure `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`, resulting in a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1.***
