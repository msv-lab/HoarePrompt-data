The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The previous state indicates that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, so the new value of `high` will be one less than the calculated mid-point. The other variables remain unchanged, but we can infer the new possible range for `high`. 

Since `high` is now one less than `mid`, the relationship between `low`, `high`, and `mid` will reflect the updated boundary. We can ascertain the new value of `high`, but without specific numerical values for `low` and `high`, we will represent it using the previous values.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is `mid - 1`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`**
