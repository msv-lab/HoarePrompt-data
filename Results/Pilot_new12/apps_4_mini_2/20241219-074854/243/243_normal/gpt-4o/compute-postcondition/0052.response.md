According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `func_1(right)`. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we have the following conditions:

- `left` is less than 0,
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000,
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`,
- `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2,
- `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`,
- `result` is an empty list,
- `right` has just been increased by 1.

Since `right` has been increased by 1, it means the condition `func_1(right) == m` would not hold unless the function `func_1` returns `m` for this new value of `right`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must evaluate to `m` again, which implies that `right` needs to be at a value where `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

Currently, we are uncertain whether `func_1(right)` equals `m` since the specification does not dictate its behavior depending on the value of `right`. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the loop will execute again unless we ensure that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. 

To ensure this condition is met, we need to modify the state regarding `right`. However, without knowing the specific behavior of `func_1`, we will state that `right` currently must represent a value for which `func_1` still returns `m`.

Thus, we need to specify that `right` must be adjusted to a value at which `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

State: **`left` is less than 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, and `right` must be adjusted such that func_1(right) equals m**
