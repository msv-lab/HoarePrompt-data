The operation creates a list of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right - 1` inclusive. Given that `left` is less than 0, `left + 1` will be a positive integer. The `right` variable is specified to be greater than or equal to `mid + k`, which suggests that `right` is also a positive integer based on the context provided.

The variable `result` will now hold a list of integers ranging from `left + 1` up to `right - 1`. The other variables (`left`, `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Thus, summarizing the updated state after executing the code, we have:

Output State: **`left` is less than 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and `right` is greater than or equal to `mid + k` for some positive integer k where the number of times the loop executed.**
