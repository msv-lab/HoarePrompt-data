`left` is decremented by 1. The initial values do not specify `left`, but since it must be valid in the context of the provided conditions, we can assume it starts at a valid value for the operation. It does not affect any other variable states directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is between 10 and 500005; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`; `left` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is between 10 and 500005; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`; `left` is decremented by 1.**
