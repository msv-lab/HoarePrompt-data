According to the code, the loop can execute if the condition `func_1(left) == m` holds true. Right before the loop, `left` is equal to `high // 2`, and we know that `zeroes` (which is `func_1(mid)`) is less than or equal to `m`. However, there is no assurance that `func_1(left)` will equal `m`. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to consider that `left` must be adjusted such that `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. We do not have specific values for `func_1`, but it’s necessary for `left` to change or for `high` to adjust in relation to `m` such that `func_1(left)` can equal `m`.

Thus, we conclude that without knowing the behavior of `func_1`, we cannot make definite adjustments. However, for the loop to execute we need:
- Either `left` should be set to a value for which `func_1(left)` would equal `m`, or we can ensure that `func_1` has a suitable implementation that connects `left` with the condition.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is between 10 and 500005; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`; and it must be ensured that func_1(left) equals m for the first iteration to execute.**
