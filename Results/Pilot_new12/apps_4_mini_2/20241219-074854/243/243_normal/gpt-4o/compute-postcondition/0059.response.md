According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, which means the loop is currently able to execute. Therefore, we do not need to make any adjustments to ensure the loop can run one more time.

Since the loop can certainly execute again based on the current state of `low` and `high`, no modifications are necessary.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, low is less than or equal to high**
