To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the line `zeroes = func_1(mid)` on the program variables.

1. The variable `mid` is already defined as `high // 2`. Its value depends on the current value of `high`, which is stated to be between 10 and 500005.
   
2. The result of `func_1(mid)` will be assigned to the variable `zeroes`. The specifics of what `func_1` does are not provided, so we know that `zeroes` will take on whatever result `func_1(mid)` produces.

3. The states of the other variables are not affected by the function call.

Given this, we will retain the values of all the original variables and just update the state to include that `zeroes` has been assigned the output of `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is between 10 and 500005; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid).**
