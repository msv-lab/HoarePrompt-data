Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `high` is updated to be the average of `low` and `high` minus 1. Otherwise, `left` is less than 0, and `right` is greater than or equal to `mid + k` for some positive integer k. The `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.***
