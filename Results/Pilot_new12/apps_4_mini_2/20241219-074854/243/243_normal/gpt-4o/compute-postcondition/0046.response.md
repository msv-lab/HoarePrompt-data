Output State: **`left` is less than 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, and `func_1(left)` is not equal to `m`. If `left` was initially 0, the loop would not execute, and `left` would remain 0.**
