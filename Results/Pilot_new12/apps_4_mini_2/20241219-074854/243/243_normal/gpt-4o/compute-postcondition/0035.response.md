The variable `zeroes` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(mid)`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which is an integer resulting from the average of `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` and now `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`.**
