According to the code, the loop execution depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must remain equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `func_1(right)` equals `m` and that `right` was set to `mid + 2`. In the context of the loop, if the condition holds true for the next iteration, there should be no adjustments needed for `m` directly. However, since `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, we need to ensure that when the loop iterates, `right` does not change in a way that `func_1(right)` becomes different from `m`.

To confirm that the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider that `right` could potentially change such that `func_1(right)` is affected. The state of `right` could be adjusted ensure that the function `func_1(right)` is aligned properly in the next check, or we must ensure that any increment or decrement does not disturb the equality.

Additionally, since `high` is between 10 and 500005, it can affect the calculation of `mid`. However, as given `func_1(right)` equals `m`, we primarily need to ensure the equality holds true for the next condition check.

In conclusion, to allow for another iteration of the loop, we consider the state where `right` might need to be maintained such that `func_1(right)` is still equal to `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`, `left` is the last value for which func_1(left) equaled `m` and has been decremented by the number of loop iterations, `right` is set to maintain func_1(right) == m**
