The provided code is a comment and does not execute any operations or assign any values to variables; it simply describes the intention of the code. Therefore, there are no changes to the current state of the variables. The variable `m` remains unchanged and is still defined as a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 100000 \).

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000**
