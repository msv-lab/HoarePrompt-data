Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; if `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `high` is updated to be the average of `low` and `high` minus 1, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, and a result list is created from integers `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is less than 0, and `right` is greater than or equal to `mid + k` for some positive integer k.***
