The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, this change reduces the upper bound of the range. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:  `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` was previously between 10 and 500005, now it is `mid - 1`; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid); `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`; the current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is now `mid - 1`; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid); `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`; the current value of `zeroes` is greater than `m`.**
