The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. Since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the value of `mid` will be the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State maintains the conditions of `m`, `low`, and `high`, while incorporating the new value of `mid`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
