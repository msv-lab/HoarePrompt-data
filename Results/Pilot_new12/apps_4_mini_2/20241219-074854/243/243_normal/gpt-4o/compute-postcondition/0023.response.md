The variable `right` is incremented by 1. Prior to the execution of the code, `right` was equal to `mid + 1`. After the operation, `right` will now be equal to `mid + 2`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`, `left` is the last value for which func_1(left) equaled `m` and has been decremented by the number of loop iterations, `right` is equal to `mid + 2`, and func_1(right) must equal m**.
