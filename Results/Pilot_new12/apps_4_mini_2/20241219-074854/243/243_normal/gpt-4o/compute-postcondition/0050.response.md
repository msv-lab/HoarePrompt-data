To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition inside the loop, which is `func_1(right) == m`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `left` is less than 0 (this does not affect the loop's condition),
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\),
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high` (this does not directly affect the loop condition),
- `mid` is equal to \((low + high) // 2\) (this is not relevant to the loop condition),
- `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)` (this is not directly relevant),
- `result` is an empty list (also not relevant),
- `right` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, it must be true that `func_1(right)` is equal to `m`.

Since `right` was just incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `func_1(right)` continues to return `m`. Therefore, `right` must be adjusted such that the value of `func_1(right)` is still equal to `m`. 

This adjustment means we need `right` to be such that:
- `func_1(right)` equals `m`.

Since we are not given specific information about the function `func_1` and its behavior with respect to `right`, we will state that to keep the loop condition valid for another iteration, we need the condition that `func_1(right + 1) == m`.

Thus, we keep everything the same except for `right` which should be adjusted accordingly. Therefore, we need to specify that `right` should be at least such that `func_1(right)` remains equal to `m` for the condition to hold.

State: **`left` is less than 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, and `right` must be adjusted such that `func_1(right) == m`**.
