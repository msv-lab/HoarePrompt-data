According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(right) == m`. Right before the loop, `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, and we need `func_1(right)` to equal `m` for the loop to execute.

Since `left` is less than 0 and `m` is a positive integer, we need to ensure that calling `func_1(right)` when `right` is `mid + 1` produces a value equal to `m`. However, without further information about the function `func_1`, we cannot ensure that the loop will execute just by stating the current values. 

Thus, for the loop to execute at least once:
- The state of `right` needs to be adjusted such that `func_1(right) == m`. This could involve incrementing or modifying the value of `right` to ensure that the outcome of `func_1(right)` is indeed `m`.

Given that `right` is `mid + 1`, we can say it needs to be adjusted. We do not have specific information about `func_1`, so it's challenging to provide an exact adjustment, but we can indicate that `right` must yield the desired output from `func_1`.

State: **`left` is less than 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, and `right` must be such that func_1(right) == m**
