The variable `right` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The other variables retain their previous values. The value of `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, and because `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` will be a positive integer corresponding to `high // 2`. Therefore, the updated value of `right` will be `mid + 1`. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is between 10 and 500005; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`; `left` is the last value for which func_1(left) equaled `m` and has been decremented by the number of loop iterations; `right` is equal to `mid + 1`.**
