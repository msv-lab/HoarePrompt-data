According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right`. For the loop to execute again, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, so to allow the loop to execute one more time, `right` must be kept the same or adjusted such that `func_1(right + 1)` also equals `m`. 

Since `right` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it suggests that `func_1(right)` might have still equaled `m` when evaluated, but the current state implies increasing `right` makes `func_1(right)` not equal to `m`. Therefore, to make `func_1(right)` equal to `m` for another iteration, we should adjust it back to its previous value where it produced `m`.

For this purpose:
- We can set `right` to whatever value produces the requirement and ensure that after incrementing, `func_1(right)` equals `m` again. Hence, we can finalize that `right` needs to be adjusted from `right + 1` back to a value from which `func_1(right)` corresponds to `m`.

State: **`left` is equal to the maximum value such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, `func_1(left + 1)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`, `right` is adjusted back to its value before the increment**.
