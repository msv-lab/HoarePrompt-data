The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `right` must be adjusted such that `func_1(right) == m`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is less than 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, and `right` has been increased by 1.
