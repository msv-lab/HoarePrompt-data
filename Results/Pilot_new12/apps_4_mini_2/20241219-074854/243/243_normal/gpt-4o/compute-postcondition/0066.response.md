According to the code, the loop execution depends on the condition `func_1(left) == m`. Given that `m` is a positive integer and we need `func_1(left)` to equal `m`, we need to ensure this condition is met. 

1. The variable `left` is initialized as `(low + high) // 2`. 
2. We need to evaluate `func_1(left)`. Since `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, we can infer that the behavior of `func_1` might differ based on the inputs.
3. To allow the while loop to execute, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. 

Since we know `m` is a positive integer, at least for the loop to run one time, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must hold true. Hence, either `left` needs to be changed such that `func_1(left)` returns `m`, or possibly, `m` needs to be constrained based on the value returned by the function applied to `left`. 

If `func_1(left)` does not equal `m` right now, it needs to be adjusted so that it does equal `m`. This could potentially involve verifying or modifying the response of `func_1` for the current `left`.

To summarize, to ensure the loop runs, we must establish that `func_1(left) `should equal `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2` and `func_1(left)` must equal `m`**
