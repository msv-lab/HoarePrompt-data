The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. Since `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, the value of `left` will then be equal to that expression. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is equal to `mid`.
