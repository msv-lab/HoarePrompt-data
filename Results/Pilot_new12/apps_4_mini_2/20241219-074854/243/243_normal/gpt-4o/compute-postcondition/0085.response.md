Given the provided initial state and the loop's behavior, we can deduce the output state after the while loop has completed its execution.

Final Output State: 
- If the loop executes at least once, `low` will be greater than `high`. 
- `result` will contain a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the point at which `func_1(left)` last equaled `m` (and `func_1(left + 1)` is not equal to `m`), and `right` is the point at which `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`.
- Final values: `low` > `high`, `result` is a list from the adjusted `left + 1` to `right - 1`, with `m` remaining a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100000`.

Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains the list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `func_1(left)` equals `m` and `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.**
