The loop continues to decrement the value of `left` as long as the result of `func_1(left)` equals `m`. The loop will execute at least once if `func_1(left)` is equal to `m` initially. 

After the loop has finished executing, the value of `left` will be the last value that resulted in `func_1(left)` no longer equaling `m`. Therefore, if `left` is decremented to a point where `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, it means that the loop has stopped because the condition `func_1(left) == m` is no longer satisfied. 

The final state of the variables can be detailed as follows:

- `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.
- `low` is still 0.
- `high` is still within the range of 10 to 500005.
- `mid` is still equal to `high // 2`.
- `result` continues to be an empty list.
- `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)` and less than or equal to `m`.
  
However, the variable of interest here is `left`. After the loop, `left` will be less than the original value by the number of times the loop executed, and it will be the first value where `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`.

Thus, the output state will be expressed as follows:

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`, `left` is the last value for which func_1(left) equaled m and has been decremented by the number of loop iterations.**
