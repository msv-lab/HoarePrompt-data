According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right`. The loop will execute again if `func_1(right)` equals `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is currently incremented by 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, it must also be true that `func_1(right)` equals `m`, meaning `func_1(right + 1)` must not equal `m`. Since `right` was incremented, to ensure that the loop can execute again, `right` should be adjusted to be such that calling `func_1(right)` still results in `m`.

State: **`left` is equal to the maximum value such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, `func_1(left + 1)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`**
