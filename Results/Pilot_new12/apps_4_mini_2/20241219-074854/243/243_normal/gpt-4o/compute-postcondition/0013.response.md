The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`, which was previously calculated as `high // 2`. Since `mid` is not directly stated in terms of specific values, we can say that now `left` will be equal to half of `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is between 10 and 500005; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is an empty list; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`; `left` is equal to `high // 2`.**
