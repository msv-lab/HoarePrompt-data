The code executes the creation of a range based on the values of `left` and `right`, where `result` is assigned to the list of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. The variables `left` and `right` remain unchanged, while `result` gets populated based on the calculated range.

Assuming `left` had a valid value and also `right` had a valid value that reflects the output of `func_1`, `result` will now contain a list of integers in the specified range. The value of `zeroes`, as calculated from `func_1(mid)`, provides context, but does not affect the outcome of the assignment to `result`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is 0; `high` is between 10 and 500005; `mid` is equal to `high // 2`; `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`; `zeroes` is equal to func_1(mid) and less than or equal to `m`; `left` remains unchanged; `right` remains unchanged.**
