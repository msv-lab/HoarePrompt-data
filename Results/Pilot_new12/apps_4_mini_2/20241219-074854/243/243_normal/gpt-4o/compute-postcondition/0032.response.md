Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `high // 2 + 1`, `high` remains between 10 and 500005, `mid` is recalculated as `high // 2`, `result` remains an empty list, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`, which is still less than `m`. Otherwise, if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as `high // 2`, `result` remains an empty list, and `zeroes` continues to be greater than or equal to `m`. If `zeroes` is less than or equal to `m`, then `high` stays between 10 and 500005, `mid` remains as `high // 2`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and `left` and `right` remain unchanged, exiting the most internal loop or if statement.***
