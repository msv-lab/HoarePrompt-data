According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `func_1(left) == m`. The loop will continue as long as the result of `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `left` value needs to be modified so that `func_1(left)` continues to return `m`. However, since `left` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, this suggests that `left` is potentially being decremented during some context within the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be decreased such that invoking `func_1(left)` still yields `m`. This implies that the range needs to ensure that there are still suitable values of `left` where `func_1(left)` equals `m`.

Therefore, for the loop to run again, we need to adjust the state to allow for the possibility that `left` can still produce `m` again on the next invocation.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, left must be adjusted such that `func_1(left)` still equals `m`.**
