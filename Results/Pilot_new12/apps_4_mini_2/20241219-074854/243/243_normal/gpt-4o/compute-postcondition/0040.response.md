To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `func_1(left) == m`. The loop will execute if the result of `func_1(left)` is equal to `m`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100000\).
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is set based on the average of `low` and `high`.
- `zeroes` is the output from `func_1(mid)`, although it does not directly influence `left`.
- `result` is initialized as an empty list, which also doesn't affect the loop condition.
- `left` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

For the loop to execute, we need `func_1(left)` to equal `m`. Since we do not have information about the behavior or outputs of `func_1`, we can only conclude that the state conditions must ensure that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that the function `func_1(left)` produces a result equal to `m`. The initial conditions do not guarantee that, so we might state that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.

Additionally, since `m` is a positive integer, `func_1(left)` must also be defined in such a way that it can indeed yield the value `m`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to (low + high) // 2 and `func_1(left)` must equal `m`**.
