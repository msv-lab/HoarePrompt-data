The variable `result` is initialized as an empty list. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will maintain the original conditions of all other variables, with the only change being the initialization of `result`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list.**
