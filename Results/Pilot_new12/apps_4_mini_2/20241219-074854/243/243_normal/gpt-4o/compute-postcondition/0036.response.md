The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, so its specific value depends on the current values of `low` and `high`. However, it is necessary to maintain that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` needs to be recalculated accordingly after this assignment to accurately represent the new bounds after incrementing `low`. The values of `m`, `high`, `zeroes`, and the previous value of `mid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`; `high` remains unchanged; `mid` is now recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`.**
