The value of `left` is decremented by 1. It was previously ensured that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, which still holds true after decrementing `left` unless it goes out of valid range. However, since no specific value for `left` has been defined, I cannot specify the bounds further. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is decreased by 1 while ensuring that `func_1(left)` still equals `m`.**
