The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Since `left` is equal to the maximum value such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, and `m` is a positive integer, `right` must now be one more than its previous value to ensure `func_1(right)` adjusts appropriately to maintain the condition. The other states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is equal to the maximum value such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, `func_1(left + 1)` is not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is incremented by 1.**
