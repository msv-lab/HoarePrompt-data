To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` loop condition: `func_1(left) == m`. 

We know from the provided program state that `zeroes`, which is calculated as `func_1(mid)`, is less than or equal to `m`. This indicates that the function `func_1` at the point of `left` has the potential to be greater than or less than `m`, but for the loop to continue executing, it specifically needs `func_1(left)` to be equal to `m`.

The current state indicates that `left` has been decreased by 1 already. If we want the loop to execute again, we need `func_1(left)` to equal `m`. If `func_1(left)` has not changed, then we will need to ensure that the value returned by `func_1` at this new `left` position is equal to `m`. Thus, we need to guarantee that `func_1(left)` will equal `m` in the next iteration.

Since `left` was decremented by 1 for the previous iteration but needs to yield the correct function output for it to be equal to `m`, we'd typically want the next position of `left` which is `left + 1` to retain the equal condition with `m`, signifying that:

1. The function `func_1(left + 1)` must remain equal to `m` or retain conditions, such that `zeroes` reflects this.

As `func_1(left + 1)` is stipulated to equal `m`, no further conditions seem necessary on `high`, `low`, or `mid` for `while func_1(left) == m` to execute.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is 0, `high` is between 10 and 500005, `mid` is equal to `high // 2`, `result` is an empty list, and func_1(left + 1) must equal m**
