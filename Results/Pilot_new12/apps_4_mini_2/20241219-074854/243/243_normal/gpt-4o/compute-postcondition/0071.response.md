Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000; `low` is less than or equal to `high; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list; `left` is decreased by 1, so `left` is now one less than its previous value where `func_1(left)` = `m` and `func_1(left - 1)` = `m`.**
