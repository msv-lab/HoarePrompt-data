The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is less than 0, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned from `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and `right` is greater than or equal to `mid + k` for some positive integer k where the number of times the loop executed, and we break out of the most internal loop.
