Output State: **`func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, `left` remains the maximum value such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, `func_1(left + 1)` is still not equal to `m`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `right` is incremented to a value such that `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`.**
