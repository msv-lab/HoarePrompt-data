To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and behavior based on the outlined requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
- Given an integer `m`, we need to find all positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` (`n!`) has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
- The output should contain the count of such integers and the integers themselves.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` by counting how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to `n`. This is because the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of pairs of 2 and 5, and 2s are more frequent than 5s in factorials.
   - The function appears correctly implemented to determine trailing zeroes.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The approach uses binary search to find a suitable `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - If it finds an `n` with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, it expands outwards using two while loops to find the range of numbers that still have exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

### Potential Cases to Check:
- For `m = 1`, based on the examples:
  - The expected output is `5` because the integers `5, 6, 7, 8, 9` have exactly one trailing zero in their factorials.
- For `m = 5`:
  - The output should correctly be `0` since no integer has exactly 5 trailing zeroes based on the examples provided.

### Edge Case Exploration:
- We need to check edge values near boundaries, such as `m = 100000`. Given a reasonably large `m` and running the function:
  - It's possible we could find no `n` meeting this requirement.
  
### Fail Cases:
- The problem notes that varying values of `n` result in varying numbers of trailing zeroes, but if a certain value of `m` is large, it would require careful handling in `func_2`.
  
- If `m` exceeds `n`, it's reasonable to suspect there may not be valid `n` that give exactly `m` zeroes. 

### Conclusion:
The program appears correct for the given examples, but concerns arise regarding boundary conditions (e.g., how it handles the maximum values). If we explore `m` values exceeding trends (like `m = 99999`), we could find it fails to output consistent results due to high limits.

After evaluating the logic comprehensively, I welcome the possibility of undiscovered edge conditions jeopardizing correctness. Thus, under scrutiny of function output reliability against higher edge-case potential:

Correctness: **False**

### Reason:
The kind of output expected for certain ranges may not fall through if the binary search does not narrow adequately or reaches appropriate limit checks. The program can fail for extreme values where no `n` exists, such as `m = 100000`.
