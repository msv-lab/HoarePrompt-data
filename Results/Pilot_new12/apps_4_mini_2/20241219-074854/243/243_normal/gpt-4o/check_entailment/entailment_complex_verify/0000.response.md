Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately evaluated the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements the necessary logic to determine how many integers `n` exist such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. 

1. The function `func_1(n)` correctly counts the trailing zeroes in `n!` using the standard method of accumulating counts of factors of 5, which is essential for this problem, as each pair of factors of 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero, and factors of 5 are the limiting factor.

2. The function `func_2(m)` employs a binary search to efficiently find the range of integers where `n!` results in exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The procedure of adjusting the bounds and checking for the exact count is clearly laid out in the annotated states, ensuring the approach is efficient and comprehensive.

The annotations provide clear confirmations of the state of the variables and ensure the logical flow of the functions matches the intended behavior described in the problem statement. All edge cases addressed in the assessment, including those where there are no integers yielding the specific count of trailing zeroes, are properly handled.

Thus, with the program's logic carefully matching both the problem requirements and the expected outputs in various test cases, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
