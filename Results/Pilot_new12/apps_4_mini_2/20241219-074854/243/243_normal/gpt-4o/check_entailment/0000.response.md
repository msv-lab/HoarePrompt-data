To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we must check if the logic correctly calculates the number of integers `n` such that the factorial of `n`, denoted as `n!`, ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting how many times 5 can be multiplied (and its powers) contribute to the factors of `n!`.
   - This is a correct and standard approach to determine the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - It initiates a binary search to find `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - The `low` and `high` bounds are set between `0` and `5 * (m + 1)`, which is reasonable as the maximum number of zeroes for given `m` can typically happen around this range.
   - The while loop checks whether the number of trailing zeroes is less than, equal to, or greater than `m` and adjusts the bounds accordingly.
   - If `zeroes` equals `m`, it looks for the range of integers that yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - After finding the immediate lower and higher boundaries, it collects the integers in that range.

### Potential Issue:
The main logic appears correct, but let's consider some edge cases. 

1. **No Trailing Zeroes Case**: 
   - If `m` is such that there are no `n` values with that number of trailing zeroes, the code should return `0`.
   - For example, if we input `m = 5`, it returns `0` as expected.
   - However, if we input `m = 1`, the program returns `5` since it finds `5, 6, 7, 8, 9` all yielding one trailing zero, which is correct.

2. **Boundary Cases for `m` up to 100,000**:
   - For very large values of `m` (like the upper limit of 100,000), we must confirm the binary search is efficient and returns the correct count and values.
   - If we input maximum constraints, we have to ensure no infinite loops or logic errors occur.

### Conclusion:
Taking into consideration the algorithm behaves correctly with edge cases and returns the count of `n` values correctly, along with the appropriate values, it suggests that both functions work as intended and fulfil the problem requirements.

Thus, after assessing the potential edge cases and scenarios based on the description, the program appears to accurately solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**.
