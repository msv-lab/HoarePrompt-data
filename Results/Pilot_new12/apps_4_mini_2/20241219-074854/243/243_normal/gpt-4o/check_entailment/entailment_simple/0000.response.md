Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description, which is to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) (the factorial of \( n \)) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. 

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( m \) from input, which is correctly constrained by the problem description (1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000).

2. **Trailing Zero Calculation**: The function `func_1(n)` accurately counts the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by calculating the contributions of factors of 5. This is because trailing zeroes in factorials are primarily determined by the number of pairs of 2 and 5 available in the products, and there are always more 2s than 5s in factorials.

3. **Finding Valid \( n \)**: The function `func_2(m)` employs a binary search approach to find the first \( n \) such that \( n! \) has at least \( m \) trailing zeroes and then counts consecutively upwards and downwards from that point to find all \( n \) that results in exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. It starts with a range from 0 to \( 5 \times (m + 1) \), which is a sufficient upper limit since each addition of 5 can potentially introduce a new zero due to the factors. 

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the count of such \( n \) values and the values themselves in increasing order. If no such numbers exist, it outputs `0`, consistent with the provided examples.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program effectively handles cases including when \( m = 5 \) (where the output is `0` since there are no \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly 5 trailing zeroes) and when \( m = 1 \) (which yields multiple valid \( n \)).

Therefore, the program covers all required functionalities as per the problem description, validating that it solves the problem as intended. Thus, the overall correctness of the program is confirmed as true.
