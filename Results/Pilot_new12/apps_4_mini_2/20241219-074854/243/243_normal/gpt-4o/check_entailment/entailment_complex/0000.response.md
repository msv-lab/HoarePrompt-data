To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the given problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find all positive integers \( n \) such that the factorial \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. This is based on the number of times 5 can be a factor in the sequence leading up to \( n \) because the trailing zeroes are created by pairs of factors 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function computes the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by counting the number of factors of 5 in the numbers between 1 and \( n \). The implementation appears correct for returning the number of trailing zeroes.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function searches for integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. It employs a binary search, which is a valid approach to find ranges where the count of trailing zeroes matches \( m \).

### Edge Cases:
- The code does not explicitly account for cases where there are no integers \( n \) for which the trailing zero count is exactly \( m \). It is stated in the annotations that it will return an empty list if there are no such integers.
- The outputs are explicitly handled: if no valid integers are found, the output is zero, consistent with the requirement from the problem description.

### Examining the Provided Examples:
- For \( m = 1 \), the code correctly identifies \( n = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \), all yielding exactly 1 trailing zero.
- For \( m = 5 \), the code returns 0, which also aligns with expectations as 5 is a threshold where \( n! \) transitions from having 5 to more than 5 trailing zeros.

### Conclusion:
The code accurately implements the problem requirements according to the annotations and consistently handles edge cases as described.

Thus, Upon comprehensive verification,

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly identifies the integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) has exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes, based on the input conditions specified.
