To evaluate the provided Python program against the problem description, we focus on the given functions and hints.

**Problem description and input/output requirements:**
- We need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n! \) (n factorial) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.
- If no such integers exist, we should return 0.

**Function Analysis:**

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - Its purpose is to return the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \) by counting how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The logic correctly counts trailing zeroes and is efficient.

   **Output hint analysis**: The hint states it computes the count of trailing zeroes using factors of 5, it aligns well with the code's implementation and algorithm.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - It aims to find all integers \( n \) whose factorial \( n! \) results in exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes.
   - It utilizes a binary search over the range, starting with \( low = 0 \) and \( high = 5 \times (m + 1) \), and then searches for the midpoint to find numbers whose factorial has the desired trailing zero count.
   - In case the exact zero count is found, it checks the range on either side to get all contiguous integers producing the same zero count.

   **Output hint analysis**: The mention of returning an empty list when no integers meet the criteria is good. However, the hints do not explicitly mention what happens when \( m \) is such that no integers exist with that number of trailing zeroes.

**Critical Analysis**:
- When \( m = 5 \), the output suggests that no integers result in exactly 5 trailing zeroes, which is correct since \( 5! = 120 \) has 1 trailing zero, \( 10! = 3628800 \) has 2 trailing zeroes, and thus for \( n = 5 \), it returns `0`.
- But when \( m = 1 \), the output states there should be 5 integers (5 through 9). The function seems to cover the range correctly by finding \( n = 5 \) through \( n = 9 \), validating that this range is well-handled.
  
**Boundary Case**:
- It must be considered what happens for values of \( m \) larger than any possible trailing zero count produced by factorial calculations.
- It appears that the function simply returns 0 when no results are found, which adheres to the requirement of the problem description.

**Conclusion**:
The functions `func_1` and `func_2`, as analyzed, correctly implement the intended logic based on the problem description and hints provided. They handle the expected ranges properly and return the appropriate outputs as desired in the problem description. Everything appears aligned and correctly functioning.

Thus, the final evaluation of correctness is as follows:

Correctness: **True**.
