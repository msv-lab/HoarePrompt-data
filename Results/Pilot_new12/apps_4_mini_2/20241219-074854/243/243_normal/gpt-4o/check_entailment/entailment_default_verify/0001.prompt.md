You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and behavior based on the outlined requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
- Given an integer `m`, we need to find all positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` (`n!`) has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
- The output should contain the count of such integers and the integers themselves.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` by counting how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to `n`. This is because the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of pairs of 2 and 5, and 2s are more frequent than 5s in factorials.
   - The function appears correctly implemented to determine trailing zeroes.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The approach uses binary search to find a suitable `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - If it finds an `n` with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, it expands outwards using two while loops to find the range of numbers that still have exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

### Potential Cases to Check:
- For `m = 1`, based on the examples:
  - The expected output is `5` because the integers `5, 6, 7, 8, 9` have exactly one trailing zero in their factorials.
- For `m = 5`:
  - The output should correctly be `0` since no integer has exactly 5 trailing zeroes based on the examples provided.

### Edge Case Exploration:
- We need to check edge values near boundaries, such as `m = 100000`. Given a reasonably large `m` and running the function:
  - It's possible we could find no `n` meeting this requirement.
  
### Fail Cases:
- The problem notes that varying values of `n` result in varying numbers of trailing zeroes, but if a certain value of `m` is large, it would require careful handling in `func_2`.
  
- If `m` exceeds `n`, it's reasonable to suspect there may not be valid `n` that give exactly `m` zeroes. 

### Conclusion:
The program appears correct for the given examples, but concerns arise regarding boundary conditions (e.g., how it handles the maximum values). If we explore `m` values exceeding trends (like `m = 99999`), we could find it fails to output consistent results due to high limits.

After evaluating the logic comprehensively, I welcome the possibility of undiscovered edge conditions jeopardizing correctness. Thus, under scrutiny of function output reliability against higher edge-case potential:

Correctness: **False**

### Reason:
The kind of output expected for certain ranges may not fall through if the binary search does not narrow adequately or reaches appropriate limit checks. The program can fail for extreme values where no `n` exists, such as `m = 100000`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `m` where \( 1 \leq m \leq 100000 \) and returns a list of integers such that the factorial of each integer in that list ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The function performs a binary search to determine the range of integers whose factorials yield the desired trailing zero count. If no integers meet this criteria, the function will return an empty list. The function also handles edge cases, such as when there are no integers with `m` trailing zeroes. The final state of the function is that it will return a list containing those integers in the specified range or an empty list if no such integers exist.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
