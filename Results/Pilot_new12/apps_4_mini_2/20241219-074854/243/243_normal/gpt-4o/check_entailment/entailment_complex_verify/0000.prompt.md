You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we must check if the logic correctly calculates the number of integers `n` such that the factorial of `n`, denoted as `n!`, ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting how many times 5 can be multiplied (and its powers) contribute to the factors of `n!`.
   - This is a correct and standard approach to determine the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial.

2. **Function `func_2(m)`**:
   - It initiates a binary search to find `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - The `low` and `high` bounds are set between `0` and `5 * (m + 1)`, which is reasonable as the maximum number of zeroes for given `m` can typically happen around this range.
   - The while loop checks whether the number of trailing zeroes is less than, equal to, or greater than `m` and adjusts the bounds accordingly.
   - If `zeroes` equals `m`, it looks for the range of integers that yield exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - After finding the immediate lower and higher boundaries, it collects the integers in that range.

### Potential Issue:
The main logic appears correct, but let's consider some edge cases. 

1. **No Trailing Zeroes Case**: 
   - If `m` is such that there are no `n` values with that number of trailing zeroes, the code should return `0`.
   - For example, if we input `m = 5`, it returns `0` as expected.
   - However, if we input `m = 1`, the program returns `5` since it finds `5, 6, 7, 8, 9` all yielding one trailing zero, which is correct.

2. **Boundary Cases for `m` up to 100,000**:
   - For very large values of `m` (like the upper limit of 100,000), we must confirm the binary search is efficient and returns the correct count and values.
   - If we input maximum constraints, we have to ensure no infinite loops or logic errors occur.

### Conclusion:
Taking into consideration the algorithm behaves correctly with edge cases and returns the count of `n` values correctly, along with the appropriate values, it suggests that both functions work as intended and fulfil the problem requirements.

Thus, after assessing the potential edge cases and scenarios based on the description, the program appears to accurately solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `power_of_5` is the smallest power of 5 that is greater than `n`, `count` is equal to `floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` until the power of 5 exceeds `n`.
    return count
    #The program returns count, which is calculated as floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the power of 5 exceeds n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where `n` is at least 1) and returns the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`). It calculates this by counting the total number of factors of 5 present in the numbers from 1 to `n`, since each pair of factors of 2 and 5 contribute to a trailing zero, and factors of 2 are more abundant than factors of 5 in factorials. The calculation iteratively sums the integer division of `n` by increasing powers of 5 until the power of 5 exceeds `n`. The return value is the accumulated count of these factors. There is no explicit handling of cases where `n` is less than 1, but per the function's precondition, it is assumed that `n` is always a valid positive integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000.
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains the list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `func_1(left)` equals `m` and `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.
    return result
    #The program returns the list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains these integers, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `m` where \( 1 \leq m \leq 100000 \) and returns a list of integers such that the factorial of each integer in that list ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The function performs a binary search to determine the range of integers whose factorials yield the desired trailing zero count. If no integers meet this criteria, the function will return an empty list. The function also handles edge cases, such as when there are no integers with `m` trailing zeroes. The final state of the function is that it will return a list containing those integers in the specified range or an empty list if no such integers exist.
