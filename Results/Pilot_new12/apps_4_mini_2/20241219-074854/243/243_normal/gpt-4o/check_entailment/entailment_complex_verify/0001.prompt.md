You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and behavior based on the outlined requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
- Given an integer `m`, we need to find all positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` (`n!`) has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
- The output should contain the count of such integers and the integers themselves.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` by counting how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to `n`. This is because the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of pairs of 2 and 5, and 2s are more frequent than 5s in factorials.
   - The function appears correctly implemented to determine trailing zeroes.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The approach uses binary search to find a suitable `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - If it finds an `n` with exactly `m` trailing zeroes, it expands outwards using two while loops to find the range of numbers that still have exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

### Potential Cases to Check:
- For `m = 1`, based on the examples:
  - The expected output is `5` because the integers `5, 6, 7, 8, 9` have exactly one trailing zero in their factorials.
- For `m = 5`:
  - The output should correctly be `0` since no integer has exactly 5 trailing zeroes based on the examples provided.

### Edge Case Exploration:
- We need to check edge values near boundaries, such as `m = 100000`. Given a reasonably large `m` and running the function:
  - It's possible we could find no `n` meeting this requirement.
  
### Fail Cases:
- The problem notes that varying values of `n` result in varying numbers of trailing zeroes, but if a certain value of `m` is large, it would require careful handling in `func_2`.
  
- If `m` exceeds `n`, it's reasonable to suspect there may not be valid `n` that give exactly `m` zeroes. 

### Conclusion:
The program appears correct for the given examples, but concerns arise regarding boundary conditions (e.g., how it handles the maximum values). If we explore `m` values exceeding trends (like `m = 99999`), we could find it fails to output consistent results due to high limits.

After evaluating the logic comprehensively, I welcome the possibility of undiscovered edge conditions jeopardizing correctness. Thus, under scrutiny of function output reliability against higher edge-case potential:

Correctness: **False**

### Reason:
The kind of output expected for certain ranges may not fall through if the binary search does not narrow adequately or reaches appropriate limit checks. The program can fail for extreme values where no `n` exists, such as `m = 100000`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `power_of_5` is the smallest power of 5 that is greater than `n`, `count` is equal to `floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` until the power of 5 exceeds `n`.
    return count
    #The program returns count, which is calculated as floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the power of 5 exceeds n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where `n` is at least 1) and returns the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`). It calculates this by counting the total number of factors of 5 present in the numbers from 1 to `n`, since each pair of factors of 2 and 5 contribute to a trailing zero, and factors of 2 are more abundant than factors of 5 in factorials. The calculation iteratively sums the integer division of `n` by increasing powers of 5 until the power of 5 exceeds `n`. The return value is the accumulated count of these factors. There is no explicit handling of cases where `n` is less than 1, but per the function's precondition, it is assumed that `n` is always a valid positive integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100000.
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains the list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `func_1(left)` equals `m` and `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.
    return result
    #The program returns the list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `low` is greater than `high`, `result` contains these integers, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 100000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `m` where \( 1 \leq m \leq 100000 \) and returns a list of integers such that the factorial of each integer in that list ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The function performs a binary search to determine the range of integers whose factorials yield the desired trailing zero count. If no integers meet this criteria, the function will return an empty list. The function also handles edge cases, such as when there are no integers with `m` trailing zeroes. The final state of the function is that it will return a list containing those integers in the specified range or an empty list if no such integers exist.
