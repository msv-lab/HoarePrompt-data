The variable `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. Since `x` will now hold the value of `i`, `x` becomes 2. Other variables' values and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `visited` is a list of Boolean values; `cycles` contains the complete sequence of visited indices; `x` is 2; `cycle` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `visited` is a list of Boolean values; `cycles` contains the complete sequence of visited indices; `x` is 2; `cycle` is an empty list.**
