Output State: **`n` is the integer value obtained from `int(data[0])`; `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer p[i] is a unique number from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer b[i] is either 0 or 1; `data` is now a list of strings resulting from the split of the input.**
