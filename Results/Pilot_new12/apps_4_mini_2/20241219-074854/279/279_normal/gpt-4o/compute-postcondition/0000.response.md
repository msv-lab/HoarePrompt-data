The line `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the `sys.stdin.read` function to the variable `input`. This means that the name `input` can now be used to call this function, which reads all input from standard input until EOF. The variables `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers of length n, where each integer p[i] is a unique number from 1 to n; `b` is a list of integers of length n, where each integer b[i] is either 0 or 1; `input` is now a reference to the function `sys.stdin.read`**.
