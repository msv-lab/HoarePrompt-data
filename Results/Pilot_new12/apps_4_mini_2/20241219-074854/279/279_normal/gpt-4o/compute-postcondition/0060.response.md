The code `cycles.append(cycle)` appends the list `cycle` to the list `cycles`. The variable `cycles` will now contain an additional element, which is the current `cycle`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is the index calculated through the sequence of `p` values; `visited` contains True for all indices visited during the loop execution; `cycle` contains the complete cycle of visited indices starting from 2 until the loop terminates; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `cycles` now includes an additional element equal to `cycle`.**
