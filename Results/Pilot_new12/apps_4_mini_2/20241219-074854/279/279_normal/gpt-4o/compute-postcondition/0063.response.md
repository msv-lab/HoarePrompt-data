To calculate the value of `no_reverse_components`, we need to evaluate how many cycles contain all elements where `b[x]` is equal to `0`. Thus, `no_reverse_components` becomes the sum of boolean values representing whether all elements in each cycle are zero in `b`.

- Assume `b` is an array where the value at each index corresponds to whether that index is part of a reverse component (0 for not part of a reverse component). 
- The initial state has no specific information about `b`, other than that its values dictate `visited` and `cycles`.

This code iterates through the `cycles` list, checking each index in each cycle. If all the indices in a cycle have a value of `0` in `b`, it counts that cycle.

The value of `no_reverse_components` will be an integer representing the count of cycles where all indices evaluate to `b[x] == 0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value, `visited` contains `True` for indices of cycles and `False` for others; `cycles` includes all discovered cycles, `no_reverse_components` is the count of cycles where for every index `x` in the cycle, `b[x] == 0`.**
