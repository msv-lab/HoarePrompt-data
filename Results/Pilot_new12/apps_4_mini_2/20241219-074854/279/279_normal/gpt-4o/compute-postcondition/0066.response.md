Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value; `visited` contains `True` for indices of cycles and `False` for others; `cycles` includes all discovered cycles, `no_reverse_components` is the count of cycles where for every index `x` in the cycle, `b[x] == 0`, and the length of `cycles` is not equal to 1.***
