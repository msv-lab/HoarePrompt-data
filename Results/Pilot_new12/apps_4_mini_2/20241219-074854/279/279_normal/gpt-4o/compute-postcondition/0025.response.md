Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` Boolean values where all elements corresponding to indices in `cycle` are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing `cycle`, which includes the values corresponding to the indices visited, and `x` is equal to the last index accessed minus 1, if `not visited[i]` is true.***
