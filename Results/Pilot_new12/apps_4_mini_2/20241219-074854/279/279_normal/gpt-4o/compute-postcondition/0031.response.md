The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the value of `x`, which is `1`, to the list `cycle`. As a result, `cycle` is updated from being an empty list to containing one element: `[1]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited[1]` is True, `cycles` is a list containing `cycle`, which is now `[1]`, `x` is 1, `cycle` is a list containing 1**
