In this case, the code appends the value of `x` to the `cycle` list. The initial state indicates that `x` is equal to 2. As a result, `cycle` will now contain the value 2.

Other variables remain unchanged, so we will summarize everything and reflect the impacted variables in the output state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited[2]` is True, `cycles` contains the complete sequence of visited indices, `x` is 2, `cycle` contains the value [2]**
