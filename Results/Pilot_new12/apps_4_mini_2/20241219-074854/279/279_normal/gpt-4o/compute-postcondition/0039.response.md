The line `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the list `cycle`. The initial state includes that `cycle` already contains the value `cycle` (which is a list) and `x` is defined as `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`. 

Since `cycle` is being modified by appending `x`, the new state of `cycle` will reflect that it includes one additional element: `x`. The values of `n`, `i`, `p[1]`, `visited`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `p[1]` is greater than 1; `visited[1]` is True; `visited[x]` is now True; `cycles` contains `cycle` now including `x`; `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`; `cycle` now contains [1, x]**
