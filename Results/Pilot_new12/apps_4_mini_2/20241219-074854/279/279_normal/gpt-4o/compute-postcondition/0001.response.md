The statement `data = input().split()` assigns the value of `input()` (which is a reference to `sys.stdin.read`) to the variable `data`, splitting the input string into a list of strings based on whitespace. Since `input()` can read from the standard input, and `n` is a positive integer determining the length of lists `p` and `b`, this will result in changing `data` to a list containing the input values split by whitespace. 

The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` remain unchanged; they are still valid from the initial state as per their defined constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers of length n, where each integer p[i] is a unique number from 1 to n; `b` is a list of integers of length n, where each integer b[i] is either 0 or 1; `data` is now a list of strings resulting from the split of the input.**
