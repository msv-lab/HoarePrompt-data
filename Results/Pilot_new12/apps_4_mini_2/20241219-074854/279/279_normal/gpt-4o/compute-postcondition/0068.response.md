Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value, `visited` contains `True` for indices of cycles and `False` for others; `cycles` includes all discovered cycles, `no_reverse_components` is the count of cycles where for every index `x` in the cycle, `b[x] == 0`. If the length of `cycles` is equal to 1, 0 has been printed. Otherwise, the function retains the state where the length of `cycles` is not equal to 1.***
