The variable `cycle` is initialized as an empty list. The initialization does not depend on the values of the other variables, so they remain unchanged. The current value of `visited[i]` is still `False`, and the rest of the state remains valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` Boolean values initialized to `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list.**
