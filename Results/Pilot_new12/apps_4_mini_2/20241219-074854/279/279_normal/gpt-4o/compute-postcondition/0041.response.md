Output State: **`visited` is a list where `visited[x]` is True for all indices that have been visited from the starting point of `1`, `cycles` is a list containing the complete sequence of visited indices in the order they were visited, `x` will be the last value assigned from the traversal of the `p` array, and the original value of `x` will have been `1`, `cycle` will contain the entire path taken during the traversal until a previously visited index is encountered.**
