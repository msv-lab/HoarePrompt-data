Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value, `visited` contains `True` for indices of cycles and `False` for others; `cycles` includes all discovered cycles, `no_reverse_components` is the count of cycles where for every index `x` in the cycle, `b[x] == 0. The current value of `cycles` is a list with exactly one cycle.***
