The code assigns the value of `p[x] - 1` to `x`. The previous value of `x` is `p[1] - 1`, and after the execution of the line, `x` will now hold the value of `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `p[1]` is greater than 1; `visited[1]` is True; `visited[x]` is set to True; `cycles` contains `cycle`; `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`; `cycle` now contains [1, x].**
