The code `cycle.append(x)` appends the current value of `x` to the list `cycle`. The initial state specifies that `x` is 0, so after this line executes, the list `cycle` will contain the value 0. The states of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` Boolean values with `visited[x]` set to `True`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` contains the value 0, `x` is 0.**
