The code initializes `cycle` as an empty list. There are no changes to any other variables, and while `cycle` is now an empty list, the other variables retain their values as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `visited` is a list of Boolean values; `cycles` contains the complete sequence of visited indices in the order they were visited including the appended `cycle`; `x` will be the last value assigned from the traversal of the `p` array with its original value being `1`; `cycle` is an empty list.**
