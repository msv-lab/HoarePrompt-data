`visited[x]` is set to `True`. Since `x` is `2`, it specifically means that `visited[2]` becomes `True`. The previous state showed that `visited[2]` was `False`, but now it's updated. The other variables remain unchanged, so the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited[2]` is True, `cycles` contains the complete sequence of visited indices, `x` is 2, `cycle` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited[2]` is True, `cycles` contains the complete sequence of visited indices, `x` is 2, `cycle` is an empty list**
