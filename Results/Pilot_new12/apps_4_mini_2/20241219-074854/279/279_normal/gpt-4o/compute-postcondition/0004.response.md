Given the initial state of the variables:

- `n` is the integer value obtained from `int(data[0])`
- `p` is a list of integers derived from `list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))`
- `b` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer `b[i]` is either 0 or 1
- `data` is a list of strings resulting from the split of the input

Analyzing the code snippet:

```
b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
```

The impact of the code on the program is that it reassigns the variable `b` by converting a slice of the `data` list (from index `n + 1` to `2 * n + 1`) into a list of integers. 

The previous values of the affected variables:
- The length of `b` remains `n` because the new list is derived from a specific slice whose length is `n`.
- While the values inside the list `b` will change based on the elements present in `data`, they are now determined from a new segment of `data`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from `int(data[0])`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))`; `b` is a list of integers from `list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))`, where each integer `b[i]` is derived from the specified slice of `data`.**
