Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `visited` is a list of Boolean values. If `visited[i]` is false, then `visited[x]` is True for all indices visited from the starting point of `1`, `cycles` contains the complete sequence of visited indices in the order they were visited including the appended `cycle`, and `x` will be the last value assigned from the traversal of the `p` array with its original value being `1`. If `visited[i]` is true, then no changes are made to `visited`, `cycles`, or `x`.***
