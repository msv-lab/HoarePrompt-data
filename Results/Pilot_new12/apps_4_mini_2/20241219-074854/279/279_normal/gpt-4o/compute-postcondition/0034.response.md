The variable `x` is calculated as `p[1] - 1`. Since `p[1]` must be greater than 1, `x` will be at least 1. In the code, the statement `visited[x] = True` will set the value at index `x` of the `visited` list to `True`. 

The variable `visited[1]` is already `True`, and since `x` can either be 1 or greater depending on the value of `p[1]`, if `p[1]` is, for example, 3, then `x` would be 2, and we don't have information about `visited[2]`. Therefore, the exact outcome depends on the value of `x`.

Now we consider two possibilities:
1. If `p[1]` is exactly 2, then `x` becomes 1, and `visited[1]` remains `True`.
2. If `p[1]` is greater than 2, say it is 3, then `x` becomes 2, and `visited[2]` will be set to `True`.

Given that the initial state of `p[1]` is simply mentioned to be greater than 1, we can only conclude that `visited[x]` is set to `True`, where `x` is `p[1] - 1`. 

Therefore, the output state would reflect the changes and scenarios based on the value of `p[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `p[1]` is greater than 1; `visited[1]` is True; `visited[x]` is set to True (where `x` is `p[1] - 1`, and `x` is 1 if `p[1]` is 2, or greater otherwise); `cycles` is a list containing `cycle`, which is now `[1]`; `x` is `p[1] - 1`; `cycle` is a list containing 1.**
