The value of `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The other variables remain unchanged as the assignment does not impact them. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` Boolean values where all elements corresponding to indices in `cycle` are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing `cycle`, which is now an empty list, and `x` is 1, `cycle` is an empty list.**
