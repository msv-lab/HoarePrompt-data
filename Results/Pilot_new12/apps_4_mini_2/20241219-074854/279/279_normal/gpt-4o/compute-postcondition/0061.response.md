Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `visited` contains True for all indices visited during the loop execution, `cycle` contains the complete cycle of visited indices starting from 2 until the loop terminates, and `cycles` now includes an additional element equal to `cycle` when `visited[i]` is false. The value of `x` is the last index calculated through the sequence of `p` values from the traversal, originally starting at 1.***
