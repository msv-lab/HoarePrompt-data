#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; p is a list of integers of length n, where each integer p[i] is a unique number from 1 to n; and b is a list of integers of length n, where each integer b[i] is either 0 or 1.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = p[x] - 1
            cycles.append(cycle)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer value, `visited` contains `True` for all indices that are part of at least one cycle, and `False` for others, `cycles` is a list containing all discovered cycles, each represented by a list of indices.
    no_reverse_components = sum(all(b[x] == 0 for x in cycle) for cycle in cycles)
    if (len(cycles) == 1) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer value, `visited` contains `True` for indices of cycles and `False` for others; `cycles` includes all discovered cycles, `no_reverse_components` is the count of cycles where for every index `x` in the cycle, `b[x] == 0`. If the length of `cycles` is equal to 1, 0 has been printed. Otherwise, the function retains the state where the length of `cycles` is not equal to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a positive integer `n`, a list `p` of unique integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` containing integers 0 or 1. It identifies cycles in a directed graph represented by `p`, where each index points to another index according to the values in `p`. The function counts how many of these cycles contain only indices where `b[x] == 0`. If exactly one cycle is found, it outputs 0. If multiple cycles are found, it prints the count of cycles that do not have any index with `b[x] == 1`, unless this count is 0, in which case it prints 1. The final state ensures that `n`, `visited`, `cycles`, and `no_reverse_components` are appropriately defined, indicating which indices are part of cycles and how many cycles meet the `b` condition. Potential edge cases include handling scenarios where cycles contain mixed values of 0 and 1 in `b`, and ensuring that all cycles are accounted for in the counts.
