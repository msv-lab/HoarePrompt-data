Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, it doesn't consider the minimum changes needed in the permutation p to ensure that every skewer will visit each of the 2n positions given any configuration of b.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
1 2
1 1
```
In this case, the permutation is already in order, and b indicates that both skewers should be reversed. However, with both reversals, each skewer can only alternate between the two positions, so they will not visit all 2n placements as required. 

The program will output `0`, stating that no changes are required, which is incorrect since both skewers must visit all positions in both directions, and they cannot due to the configuration.

This illustrates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to it being marked as incorrect.
