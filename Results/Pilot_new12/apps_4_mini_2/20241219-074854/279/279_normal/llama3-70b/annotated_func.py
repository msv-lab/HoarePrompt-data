#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, p is a list of n integers where each integer p_i (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) is part of a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, and b is a list of n integers consisting of zeros and ones.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the total count of instances where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` or `b[i]` is equal to 0 over all iterations, `i` is `n-1` after the last iteration, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n`, a list `p` representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of `n` integers that can only be 0 or 1. It counts how many elements in `p` do not match their expected position (i.e., `p[i]` is not `i + 1`) and adds one to a count for each corresponding `b[i]` that is 0. The final output of the function is the total count stored in the variable `ans`, which reflects the number of mismatches in `p` and the number of zeros in `b`. The function does not account for any restrictions on the validity or contents of `b` beyond the values being either 0 or 1, which assumes correct input is provided as per the given constraints. After execution, the program outputs this accumulated count.
