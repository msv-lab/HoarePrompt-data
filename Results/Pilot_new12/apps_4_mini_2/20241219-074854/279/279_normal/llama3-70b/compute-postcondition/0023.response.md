The function `func` accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, a list `p` of length `n` which contains integers that form a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of length `n` that consists of zeros and ones. After executing the function body, it returns a specific output based on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n, a list p that is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a list b consisting of zeros and ones. The exact output of the function will depend on the specific logic implemented within the function but will be based on these inputs.**
