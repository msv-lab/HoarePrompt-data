The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Given that `ans` can either be 2 or 3, the new value of `ans` will be either 3 or 4, respectively. The variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is either 3 or 4 depending on its previous value.**
