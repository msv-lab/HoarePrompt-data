`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, and the condition about the element at index `i` in `p` not being equal to `i + 1` remains relevant but unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` in `p` is not equal to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` in `p` is not equal to `i + 1.**
