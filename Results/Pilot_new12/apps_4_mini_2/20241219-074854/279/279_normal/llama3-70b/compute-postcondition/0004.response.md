According to the code, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not run at all. Before the loop starts, the variable `ans` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. However, the variable `i` needs to be initialized correctly for the loop to execute. 

For the loop to be executed, the following conditions must be met: `n` must be greater than 0, and at the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
