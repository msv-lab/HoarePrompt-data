`ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` is initially either 3 or 4, after the increment, `ans` will be either 4 or 5. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `ans` is either 4 or 5.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is either 4 or 5**.
