`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is either 1 or 2, so after the operation, `ans` will be either 2 or 3, respectively. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is either 2 or 3 depending on its previous value.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is either 2 or 3 depending on its previous value.**
