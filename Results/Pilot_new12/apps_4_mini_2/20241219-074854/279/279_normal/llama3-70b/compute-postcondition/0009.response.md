The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` is set to 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `ans` becomes 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 2, `i` remains 0, and the element at index `i` in `b` is equal to 0.**
