The variable `p` is assigned a list created from the `input` function that splits the input string and converts each element into an integer. The input consists of `n` integers where each integer \( p_i \) (1 ≤ \( p_i \) ≤ n) is part of a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`. The values of `n`, `b`, and the permutation condition for `p` do not change, but the specific list `p` is now established based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `p` is a list of n integers based on input; `b` is a list of n integers consisting of zeros and ones.**
