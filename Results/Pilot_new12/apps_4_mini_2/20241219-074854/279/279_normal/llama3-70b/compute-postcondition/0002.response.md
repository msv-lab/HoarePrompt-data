The variable `b` is assigned a new list consisting of integers converted from the input split by spaces. The previous initial state of `b` being a list of zeros and ones is overwritten. The value of `n` remains the same, and `p`, as a list of `n` integers, is also unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `p` is a list of `n` integers based on input; `b` is now a new list of integers based on the latest input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `p` is a list of `n` integers based on input; `b` is a list of integers derived from the latest input**.
