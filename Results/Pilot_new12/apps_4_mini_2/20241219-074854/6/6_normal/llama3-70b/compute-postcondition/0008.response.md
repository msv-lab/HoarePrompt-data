To determine the Output State, we need to evaluate how the given code snippet affects the variables based on the initial state.

1. We are given that `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r` are integers with constraints.
2. The expression modifies `ans` based on the values of `pos`, `l`, and `r`.
3. The expression `ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)` calculates two parts:
   - `min(pos - 1, n - r)`: This will compute the minimum of `pos - 1` and `n - r`, which indicates how far `pos` is from the beginning of the range or how much room is left after `r`.
   - `max(0, l - 1)`: This computes how far `l` is from the beginning of the range, not allowing negative values.

Now, since we do not know the original value of `ans` as it is not stated, we'll assume it was an integer prior. The value of `ans` gets updated based on the calculations of the two parts mentioned above.

Output State: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r, and l ≤ r ≤ n; `ans` is updated to `ans + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`**
