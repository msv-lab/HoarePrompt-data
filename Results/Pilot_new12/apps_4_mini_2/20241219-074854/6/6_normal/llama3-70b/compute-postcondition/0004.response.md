Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos` is an integer (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l` is an integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r), `r` is an integer (l ≤ r ≤ n), and `ans` is a positive integer equal to `l - pos` when `pos` is less than `l`. There is no else part, so no other changes are made to `ans` when `pos` is greater than or equal to `l`.***
