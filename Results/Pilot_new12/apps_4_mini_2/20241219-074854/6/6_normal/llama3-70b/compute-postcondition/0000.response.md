The variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are all assigned new values based on the input provided via `map(int, input().split())`. This means that they will take form of integers based on user input while still fulfilling their original constraints of being within the limits (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, and 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n). The original relationships between the variables remain valid, but the specific values become determined by the user input. 

Thus, the updated output state will reflect that `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are now specific integers based on the input provided. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos` is an integer (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l` is an integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r), `r` is an integer (l ≤ r ≤ n) and all values are determined by user input.**
