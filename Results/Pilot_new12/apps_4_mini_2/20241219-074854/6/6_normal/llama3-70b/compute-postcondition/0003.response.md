The value of `ans` is incremented by `l - pos`. Since `pos` is less than `l`, the result of `l - pos` is a positive integer. Therefore, `ans` now holds the value of the previous `ans` (which was 0) plus the calculated difference. 

The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state reflects the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos` is an integer (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l` is an integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r), `r` is an integer (l ≤ r ≤ n), `ans` is a positive integer equal to `l - pos`.**
