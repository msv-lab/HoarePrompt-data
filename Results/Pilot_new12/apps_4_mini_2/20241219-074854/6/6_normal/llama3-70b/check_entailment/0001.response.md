Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly account for all scenarios that arise from the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Moves**: The calculation of the cursor movements and the operations to close tabs does not accurately reflect the problem requirements.
2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle some edge cases adequately. For example:
   - When the position of the cursor (`pos`) is strictly within the range `[l, r]`, it should not need to make any moves or perform any operations to close the tabs, yet the logic in the program might give incorrect outputs.
   - If `l == 1` and `r == n`, all tabs are already opened, and thus the output should be `0`, but the current implementation might not yield the correct result.

To illustrate, let's consider an input case that the program fails for:

Input:
```
5 3 2 4
```
Expected Output: 
```
1
```
Explanation: The cursor is at position 3, which is in the range `[2, 4]`. Luba only needs to close the tab to the left at index 1. Thus only 1 second is needed to close tab 1.

However, given the logic in the existing code, it makes unnecessary calculations which result in an incorrect output.

Hence, the program is incorrect.
