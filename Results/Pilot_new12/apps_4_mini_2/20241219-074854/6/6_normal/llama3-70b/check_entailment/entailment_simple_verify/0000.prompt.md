You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
Luba wants to close all the tabs that are outside of the range `[l, r]`, and she can only close the tabs by moving to the limits of the range or closing adjacent tabs.

### Program Analysis:
1. The function takes four integer inputs `n` (total tabs), `pos` (current tab), `l` (left limit), and `r` (right limit).
2. The program checks if the cursor position is less than `l`, in which case it calculates the seconds needed to move to `l` and closes tabs left of `l`.
3. If the cursor position is greater than `r`, it calculates the seconds to move to `r` and closes tabs to the right.
4. The program also accounts for closing tabs to the left of the minimum index and right of the maximum index within the available range.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. When the cursor `pos` is already within the limits `[l, r]`, such as having `l = 1` and `r = 5`, with `pos = 3`. In this case, no moves or closures are necessary, and `ans` should be `0`.
2. The calculations used in the program might inadvertently lead to undercounting the number of operations needed if the transition between moving and closing is not adequately represented.

### Testing with Edge Cases:
Let’s inspect some scenarios:
- **Scenario 1:** Using input `6 3 5 6`
    - The cursor is at `3`, but the segment we want to keep is `[5, 6]`. 
    - She would need to move to `5`, which takes `2` seconds (3 -> 4 -> 5) and then close tabs left of `5`, which would take an additional moment to do so, leading to 3 seconds in total.
- **Scenario 2:** Using input `10 1 4 7`
    - Here, the cursor is at `1` and we want to keep `[4, 7]`. Move to `4` would take `3` seconds (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4) and then she would have to close tabs on the left, which adds one more second. The total would be 4 seconds.
  
### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic in scenarios where tabs need to be assessed beyond just the immediate left or right. In cases where the cursor starts from the leftmost tabs or the rightmost tabs within the bounds, it fails to accumulate the additional seconds accurately.

The operation count logic is flawed because the calculations for situations where the moves should be rectified after closing left or right are inadequately defined. 

### Final Input Case Check:
The original test cases show discrepancies in counting the necessary moves and the outcomes suggest that the count could be lower than required based on the function's formulation.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**. 
The program fails for various edge cases where the cursor and the limits are positioned incorrectly relative to each other, leading to incorrect seconds calculated.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), pos is an integer (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, representing the segment of tabs that need to remain opened.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if (pos < l) :
        ans += l - pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `pos` is an integer (1 ≤ pos ≤ n), `l` is an integer (1 ≤ l ≤ r), `r` is an integer (l ≤ r ≤ n), and `ans` is a positive integer equal to `l - pos` when `pos` is less than `l`. There is no else part, so no other changes are made to `ans` when `pos` is greater than or equal to `l`.
    if (pos > r) :
        ans += pos - r
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r, and l ≤ r ≤ n. If `pos` is greater than `r`, then `ans` is updated to its original value plus `(pos - r)`. If `pos` is less than or equal to `r`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
