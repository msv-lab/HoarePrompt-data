Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 100, pos is an integer such that 1 <= pos <= n, l is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r <= n, r is an integer such that r <= n, and it is not the case that (l == 1 and r == n). The current value of l is equal to 1. Either l is not equal to 1 or r is not equal to n, or both.***
