The variable `close_both_sides` is assigned the minimum value between `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`. The calculations of `move_to_l` (which is `abs(pos - l)`) and `move_to_r` (which is `abs(pos - r)`) depend on the values of `pos`, `l`, and `r`.

Letâ€™s express `close_both_sides` in terms of `pos`, `l`, and `r`:

1. `move_to_l = abs(pos - l)`
2. `move_to_r = abs(pos - r)`

Then:

- `close_both_sides = min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`

The states of the other variables (`n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`) are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is less than `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`; `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`.**
