The variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The input values are taken from the user and are required to satisfy the conditions that `n` is between 1 and 100, `pos` is between 1 and `n`, `l` is between 1 and `r`, and `r` is between `l` and `n`. The exact values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` depend on the user input.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` have been updated based on user input while maintaining the constraints described.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, pos is an integer such that 1 <= pos <= n, l is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r <= n, and r is an integer such that r <= n, with new values assigned from user input.**
