Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `r` is an integer such that `r` <= `n`, `l` is not equal to 1, and it is not the case that (`l` == 1 and `r` == `n`). If `r` is equal to `n`, then the expression `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been computed and printed. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is printed.***
