`move_to_r` is assigned the value of `abs(pos - r)`, where `pos` is the current position and `r` is some integer between `l` and `n`. The value of `move_to_r` will depend on the specific values of `pos` and `r`, but it will always be a non-negative integer representing the distance from `pos` to `r`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is less than `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`.**
