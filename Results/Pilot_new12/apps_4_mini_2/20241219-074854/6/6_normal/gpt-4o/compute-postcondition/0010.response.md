`move_to_l` is assigned the absolute value of `pos - l`. Given the initial conditions, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer that falls between 1 and `n`, and `l` is in the range defined between 1 and `r`. Since `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is less than `n`, we can conclude various relative values for `pos`, `l`, and their difference.

The calculations yield `move_to_l` as `abs(pos - l)`. Therefore, the output state needs to reflect the potential scenarios based on the values of `pos` and `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is less than `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`.**
