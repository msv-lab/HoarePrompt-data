To execute the given code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the code provided.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; 
- `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; 
- `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is less than `n`; 
- `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; 
- `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`; 
- `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`.

The code `print(close_both_sides)` outputs the value of the variable `close_both_sides`.

Since the variable `close_both_sides` is already defined based on the initial state, it will not change after executing the print command. It will simply output its current value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is less than `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`; `close_both_sides` is currently printed.**
