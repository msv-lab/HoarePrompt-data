Postcondition: ***`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n`, and `r <= n`. If `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`, then 0 is printed. If `l` equals 1 but `r` is not equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` equals `n`, then the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, the absolute distances `move_to_l` and `move_to_r` are calculated and `close_both_sides` is printed.***
