The expression `print(abs(pos - l) + 1)` computes the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`, adds 1 to that result, and then prints it. Since this operation does not modify any variables and only produces an output, we will maintain the original conditions for all relevant variables.

The output will depend on the specific values of `pos` and `l`. However, since no variables are changed, we only specify that the expression has been computed and printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `r` is an integer such that `r` <= `n`, `l` is not equal to 1, and it is not the case that (`l` == 1 and `r` == `n`. The current value of `r` is equal to `n`. The expression `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been computed and printed.**
