The code `print(abs(pos - r) + 1)` computes a value based on the variables `pos` and `r`, but it does not change any of their values. The output of this statement is simply the result of the computation, which can be expressed as `abs(pos - r) + 1`. The initial conditions still hold after this operation.

The states of the variables are not altered, while the output prints a value based on the formula. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 <= pos <= n, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r <= n, `r` is an integer such that r <= n and it is not the case that (l == 1 and r == n), and the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`**.
