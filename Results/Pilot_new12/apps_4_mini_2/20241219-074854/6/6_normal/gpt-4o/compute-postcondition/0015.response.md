Postcondition: ***`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n`, and `r <= n`. If `l` is equal to 1, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `l` is not equal to 1, and if `r` is equal to `n`, then the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)` and `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)` and `close_both_sides` is printed.***
