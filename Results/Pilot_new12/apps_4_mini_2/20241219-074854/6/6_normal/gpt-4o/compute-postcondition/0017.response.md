The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

1. `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 100.
2. `pos`, which is an integer such that 1 <= pos <= n.
3. `l`, which is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r <= n.
4. `r`, which is an integer such that r <= n.

The specific functionality based on the parameters has not been detailed in the output section provided, so I'm unable to summarize the exact return values or cases. However, the function utilizes these constraints to likely perform some operations or checks based on the provided range and positional values.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 100), pos (an integer between 1 and n), l (an integer such that l <= r <= n), and r (an integer such that r <= n), but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.**
