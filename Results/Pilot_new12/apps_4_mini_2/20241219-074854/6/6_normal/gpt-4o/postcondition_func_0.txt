The function accepts four integer parameters: n (1 <= n <= 100), pos (1 <= pos <= n), l (1 <= l <= r <= n), and r (r <= n). It calculates and prints a distance based on the relative positions of 'pos', 'l', and 'r'. It handles several cases: If l is 1 and r is n, it prints 0; if l is 1 and r is not n, it prints the distance from 'pos' to 'r' plus 1; if l is not 1 and r is n, it prints the distance from 'pos' to 'l' plus 1; otherwise, it calculates the absolute distances from 'pos' to both 'l' and 'r', and prints the minimum total distance needed to traverse between them while accounting for the distance between 'l' and 'r' plus 2. The final output is based on these calculations, representing the shortest movement necessary to transition between the specified positions.
