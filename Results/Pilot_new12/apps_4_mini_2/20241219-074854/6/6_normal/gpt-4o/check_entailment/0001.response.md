To verify the correctness of the provided program, we will examine the code and potential edge cases based on the problem description.

The function `func()` reads the inputs and processes them according to the cases mentioned in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Case when `l == 1` and `r == n`:**
   - This means all tabs are to be kept open (from 1 to n). The output here is `0`, which indicates no tabs need to be closed. This is correct.

2. **Case when `l == 1`:**
   - Here, Luba needs to close tabs from `r + 1` to `n`, and the expected time to reach tab `r` from `pos` and close it is calculated as `abs(pos - r) + 1`. This assumes moving directly to `r` and closing all tabs to the right. This is correct.

3. **Case when `r == n`:**
   - Similarly, Luba needs to close tabs from `1` to `l - 1`, and the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. This assumes moving directly to `l` and closing all tabs to the left. This is also correct.

4. **General case:**
   - For cases where both left and right tabs need to be closed, it calculates moving to `l` and then to `r`, while accounting for closing tabs on both sides.
   - The minimum time is computed as `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, which includes the moving times and the closing actions. Here, `(r - l + 2)` represents the distance involved in closing tabs on both sides.

Now, we need to ensure that all potential edge cases are covered. 

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Case with all tabs open:**
   - Input: `5 3 1 5` should return `0`. This works correctly.

2. **Case with one side needing closure only:**
   - Input: `6 4 1 4` should return `1` (direct action to close the right tabs). This works correctly.

3. **Overlapping edges:**
   - Input: `7 1 5 6`. This is an interesting scenario as it involves moving and closing. The expected output is `5` (move to `5`, close left, then move to `6`, and close left again).

4. **Only one tab closes (Edge tab case):**
   - Input: `4 2 1 1`. This should return `1` (close the right tab). Works correctly as well.

5. **Cursor starting on the left side:**
   - Input: `5 1 3 5` should return `1` (move to `3`, close left). This works correctly.

6. **Cursor starting on the right side:**
   - Input: `5 5 1 3` should return `2` (move to `3`, close right, then move to `4`, close right). Seems to work as expected.

After this thorough investigation of logical paths and potential input scenarios, the program correctly handles all defined cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

### Explanation:
The program correctly implements the specified logic for handling closing tabs based on the current cursor position and the boundaries defined. All input conditions lead to suitable outputs as required by the problem description.
