You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif l == 1:
        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
    elif r == n:
        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
        print(close_both_sides)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, we will examine the code and potential edge cases based on the problem description.

The function `func()` reads the inputs and processes them according to the cases mentioned in the problem description. Here’s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Case when `l == 1` and `r == n`:**
   - This means all tabs are to be kept open (from 1 to n). The output here is `0`, which indicates no tabs need to be closed. This is correct.

2. **Case when `l == 1`:**
   - Here, Luba needs to close tabs from `r + 1` to `n`, and the expected time to reach tab `r` from `pos` and close it is calculated as `abs(pos - r) + 1`. This assumes moving directly to `r` and closing all tabs to the right. This is correct.

3. **Case when `r == n`:**
   - Similarly, Luba needs to close tabs from `1` to `l - 1`, and the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. This assumes moving directly to `l` and closing all tabs to the left. This is also correct.

4. **General case:**
   - For cases where both left and right tabs need to be closed, it calculates moving to `l` and then to `r`, while accounting for closing tabs on both sides.
   - The minimum time is computed as `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, which includes the moving times and the closing actions. Here, `(r - l + 2)` represents the distance involved in closing tabs on both sides.

Now, we need to ensure that all potential edge cases are covered. 

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Case with all tabs open:**
   - Input: `5 3 1 5` should return `0`. This works correctly.

2. **Case with one side needing closure only:**
   - Input: `6 4 1 4` should return `1` (direct action to close the right tabs). This works correctly.

3. **Overlapping edges:**
   - Input: `7 1 5 6`. This is an interesting scenario as it involves moving and closing. The expected output is `5` (move to `5`, close left, then move to `6`, and close left again).

4. **Only one tab closes (Edge tab case):**
   - Input: `4 2 1 1`. This should return `1` (close the right tab). Works correctly as well.

5. **Cursor starting on the left side:**
   - Input: `5 1 3 5` should return `1` (move to `3`, close left). This works correctly.

6. **Cursor starting on the right side:**
   - Input: `5 5 1 3` should return `2` (move to `3`, close right, then move to `4`, close right). Seems to work as expected.

After this thorough investigation of logical paths and potential input scenarios, the program correctly handles all defined cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

### Explanation:
The program correctly implements the specified logic for handling closing tabs based on the current cursor position and the boundaries defined. All input conditions lead to suitable outputs as required by the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 100, pos is an integer such that 1 <= pos <= n, l is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r <= n, and r is an integer such that r <= n.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if (l == 1 and r == n) :
        print(0)
    else :
        if (l == 1) :
            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
        else :
            if (r == n) :
                print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
            else :
                move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
                move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
                close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
                print(close_both_sides)
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `r` is an integer such that `r` <= `n`, `l` is not equal to 1, and it is not the case that (`l` == 1 and `r` == `n`). If `r` is equal to `n`, then the expression `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been computed and printed. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` is printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n`, and `r <= n`. If `l` is equal to 1, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `l` is not equal to 1, and if `r` is equal to `n`, then the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)` and `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)` and `close_both_sides` is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n`, and `r <= n`. If `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`, then 0 is printed. If `l` equals 1 but `r` is not equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` equals `n`, then the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, the absolute distances `move_to_l` and `move_to_r` are calculated and `close_both_sides` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters: n (1 <= n <= 100), pos (1 <= pos <= n), l (1 <= l <= r <= n), and r (r <= n). It calculates and prints a distance based on the relative positions of 'pos', 'l', and 'r'. It handles several cases: If l is 1 and r is n, it prints 0; if l is 1 and r is not n, it prints the distance from 'pos' to 'r' plus 1; if l is not 1 and r is n, it prints the distance from 'pos' to 'l' plus 1; otherwise, it calculates the absolute distances from 'pos' to both 'l' and 'r', and prints the minimum total distance needed to traverse between them while accounting for the distance between 'l' and 'r' plus 2. The final output is based on these calculations, representing the shortest movement necessary to transition between the specified positions.
