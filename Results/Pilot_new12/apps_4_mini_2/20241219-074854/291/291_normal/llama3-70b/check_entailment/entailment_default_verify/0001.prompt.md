You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

Original Assessment: To validate the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler for Sofia to draw `n` squares.

The program uses the following logic:

1. It takes an integer input `n`, which represents the number of squares.
2. It calculates `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` and prints the result.

The term `n.bit_length()` returns the number of bits required to represent the integer `n` in binary. The expression `n.bit_length() - 1` effectively gives us the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. The whole calculation is followed by multiplying by 2 and adding 2.

**Understanding the required output for the problem:**
For `n` squares:
- Each square requires four segments (2 horizontal and 2 vertical).
- The more squares drawn that are next to each other, the fewer segments need drawing with a ruler.

**Analyzing with examples:**
- For `n = 1`:  
Expected: 2 segments required (Correct: `2`).
- For `n = 2`: 
Expected: 3 segments required (Correct: `3`).
- For `n = 4`: 
Expected: 4 segments required (Correct: `4`).

**Testing edge cases:**
The program's output for small values (from 1 up to 4) matches the expected results. However, we need to critically analyze whether the calculation `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` may lead to incorrect results beyond these cases.

Let's check for a few larger values:
- For `n = 3`: 
Expected segments should be `4` (as Sofia can arrange these in a 2x2 square formation, needing 4 segments).  
Calculation: `3.bit_length() -> 2; 2*(2-1)+2 = 4` (Correct).
- For `n = 5`:
Expected segments should still be `4`, as Sofia can arrange them similarly, needing only 4 segments.  
Calculation: `5.bit_length() -> 3; 2*(3-1)+2 = 6` (Incorrect).
- For larger numbers like `n = 8`:
Expected segments should be `4`.  
Calculation: `8.bit_length() -> 4; 2*(4-1)+2 = 8` (Incorrect).

**Conclusion on Correctness:**
The program does not correctly calculate the required segment counts for certain values of `n` (e.g., `n = 5`), where the expected output is lower than what the program calculates.

Therefore, based on the examples analyzed, we find that the program does not consistently fulfill the task as outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 
An example where the program fails is when `n = 5`, where the program incorrectly outputs `6`, but the expected output is `4`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function prompts the user for a positive integer input \( n \) within the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). It then computes and prints the result of the expression \( 2 \times (\text{bit length of } n - 1) + 2 \). This calculation effectively determines the number of bits required to represent \( n \) in binary, adjusted by a constant. The function does not return any values, but it produces an output based on the input \( n \). There is no error handling for invalid inputs or numbers outside the specified range, which can lead to runtime errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
