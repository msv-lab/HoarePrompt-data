The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work internally with a positive integer `n`, which is constrained by the condition that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). The function operates based on this integer value and returns an output that is not specified here. 

Given the lack of specific outputs mentioned, I cannot detail the exact return value. Therefore, based on the provided constraints, I will summarize the known details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on a positive integer n constrained by \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).**
