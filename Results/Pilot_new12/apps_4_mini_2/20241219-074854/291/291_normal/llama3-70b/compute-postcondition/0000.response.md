The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the output state will reflect that `n` is now an input integer that meets this condition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from the input with the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)**
