`2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` calculates a value based on the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, specifically taking into account the length of `n` minus one, and then scaling it. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but this specific calculation results in an output being printed rather than assigned to a variable.

The valid information about `n` remains the same, as well as the printed result reflecting the transformation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from the input with the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the output printed is `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.**
