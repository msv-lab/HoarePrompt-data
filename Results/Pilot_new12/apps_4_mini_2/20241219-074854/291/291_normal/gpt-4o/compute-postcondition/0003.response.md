The `segments_needed` is assigned the value of `2 * (a + b)`. Given that `a` is 1 and `b` is equal to `n`, we can substitute the values: 

`segments_needed = 2 * (1 + n)`.

Since `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the value of `segments_needed` will be a positive integer in the range of \(4\) (when \(n=1\)) to \(2000000002\) (when \(n=10^9\)). 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `min_segments_needed` is float('inf'); `a` is 1; `b` is equal to `n`; `segments_needed` is equal to `2 * (1 + n)`.**
