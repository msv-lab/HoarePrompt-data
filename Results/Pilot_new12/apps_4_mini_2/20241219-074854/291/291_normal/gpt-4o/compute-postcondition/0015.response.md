The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, it returns the minimum value of `segments_needed` calculated during all iterations, which is stored in `min_segments_needed`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the minimum value of `segments_needed` determined throughout the function's computations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns the minimum value of segments_needed calculated during all iterations.**
