Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `min_segments_needed` is equal to the minimum value of `segments_needed` calculated during all iterations; `a` is equal to the maximum value of `a` during the iterations, which is `int(math.sqrt(n))`; `b` is the corresponding value of `b` calculated with that maximum `a`; `segments_needed` is equal to `2 * (max(a) + b)` where `max(a)` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`.**
