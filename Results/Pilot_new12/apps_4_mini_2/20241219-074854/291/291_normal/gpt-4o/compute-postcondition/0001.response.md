To determine the necessary states for the for loop `for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):` to execute, we need to analyze the values of `n` and `a`.

1. The loop iterates from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 1.
2. Since `n` is given to be a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), the minimum value of `n` is 1.
3. When `n` is 1, `int(math.sqrt(1))` equals 1, so the range becomes `range(1, 2)`, allowing the loop to execute once with `a` being 1.
4. Additionally, at the end of the previous state before entering the loop, `a` should have a valid starting value which is 1 for the first iteration.

Thus, we need to ensure that `n` must be at least 1 (which it is), and `a` will take a value starting from 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `min_segments_needed` is float('inf'), `a` is 1**
