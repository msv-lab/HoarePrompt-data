The value of `b` is assigned the value of `(n + a - 1) // a`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 to 10^9) and `a` is 2. Therefore, the formula becomes `(n + 2 - 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n + 1) // 2`. The values of `min_segments_needed` and `segments_needed` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `min_segments_needed` is equal to `2 + 2n`; `a` is 2; `b` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`; `segments_needed` is equal to `2 + 2n`.**
