    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `min_segments_needed` is equal to the minimum value of `segments_needed` calculated during all iterations; `a` is equal to the maximum value of `a` during the iterations, which is `int(math.sqrt(n))`; `b` is the corresponding value of `b` calculated with that maximum `a`; `segments_needed` is equal to `2 * (max(a) + b)` where `max(a)` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

    #The program returns the minimum value of segments_needed calculated during all iterations, which is stored in min_segments_needed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, where `1 <= n <= 10^9`. It calculates the minimum value of `segments_needed` based on pairs of integers `a` and `b`, where `a` iterates from 1 to the integer square root of `n`. For each `a`, it computes `b` as the ceiling of `n/a`, then calculates `segments_needed` as `2 * (a + b)`. After iterating through all possible values of `a`, the function returns the smallest `segments_needed` found. Edge cases addressed by the function include ensuring that `n` is within the specified range and correctly calculating the segments for all integer divisors of `n`. The function does not account for non-integer inputs, negative values, or zero, as `n` is strictly defined to be a positive integer.
