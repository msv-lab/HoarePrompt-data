d is a positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) representing the number of sofas, n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) representing the dimensions of the storehouse, and each sofa is represented by four integers (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) where 1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n and 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m. Additionally, cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b are non-negative integers (0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1) indicating the count of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa, respectively.
