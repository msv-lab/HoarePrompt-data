Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to correctly count the respective counts of sofas in the four directions (left, right, top, bottom) based on the conditions laid out in the problem description. The logic for counting relative positions has a fundamental flaw in the implementation of conditions for determining counts.

For example, in the counting logic, the conditions to count "left" and "right" sofas are inverted:

- The check `if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j:` incorrectly identifies when sofas are to the right. It should instead check if the current sofa's `x2` coordinate is less than the `x1_j` coordinate of the other sofa.
- Similarly, the condition `if x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j:` is also flawed. It incorrectly checks for the left condition. The correct check should evaluate whether the second sofa is to the right of the first.

Additionally, corner cases such as a sofa being completely isolated or only adjacent to other sofas in one direction may not be correctly identified due to these incorrect logical checks. 

One specific counterexample from the problem description can be constructed as follows:

Consider a situation where there are three sofas positioned in such a way that:
- Sofa 1 is at (1,1) and (1,2)
- Sofa 2 is at (2,1) and (2,2)
- Sofa 3 is at (3,1) and (3,2)

If the criteria given for the number of sofas on the left, right, top, and bottom were set such that `cnt_l = 0`, `cnt_r = 2`, `cnt_t = 0`, and `cnt_b = 1`, according to the faulty logic, the program may incorrectly identify one of the sofas rather than correctly returning -1 if no suitable sofa exists.

Thus, due to systematic counting errors, the program cannot guarantee correct output for the described conditions, confirming the correctness has failed.
