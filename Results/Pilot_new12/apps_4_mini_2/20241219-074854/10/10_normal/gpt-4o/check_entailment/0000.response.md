Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly count the number of sofas around a given sofa in certain configurations. Specifically, the logic used to determine whether one sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of another is flawed. 

### Example of the issue:
Consider the following configuration:
- `d = 3` (3 sofas)
- Matrix size is arbitrary; let’s assume it’s sufficiently large to fit the sofas.
- Sofa coordinates:
  - Sofa 1: (1, 1) (covers cells (1, 1) and (1, 2))
  - Sofa 2: (1, 3) (covers cells (1, 3) and (1, 4))
  - Sofa 3: (2, 1) (covers cells (2, 1) and (2, 2))
- The counts given for Grandpa Maks's sofa are:
  - `cnt_l = 1` (1 sofa to the left)
  - `cnt_r = 1` (1 sofa to the right)
  - `cnt_t = 1` (1 sofa above)
  - `cnt_b = 0` (0 sofas below)

With the above setup:
- The algorithm may miscount based on how it is currently structured—since it checks for neighbors by strict inequalities which might not account correctly for adjacent sofas on the same x or y coordinate leading to potential misclassifications. 

For instance:
- Sofa 1 does not have a sofa to the left or right but might count other configurations incorrectly based on its logic flow due to the usage of strict inequalities without including edges properly.

Thus, due to the inaccuracies in counting neighboring sofas, the code does not guarantee the correct identification of Grandpa Maks's sofa in every potential input scenario.
