You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?

Fortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!

The storehouse is represented as matrix n × m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.

Sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. 

Note that in all conditions A ≠ B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.

The note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} — to the right, cnt_{t} — to the top and cnt_{b} — to the bottom.

Grandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.

Output the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of sofas in the storehouse.

The second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the storehouse.

Next d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) — coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  ≠  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.

The last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).


-----Output-----

Print the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.


-----Examples-----

1 2 2 2
1 0 0 0

Output

-----Note-----

Let's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. 

So the second one corresponds to the given conditions.

In the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. 

And there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.
Program:
```
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            if x1 < x1_j and x2 < x1_j:
                right_count[i] += 1
            if x1 > x2_j and x2 > x2_j:
                left_count[i] += 1
            if y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j:
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            if y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j:
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and check if it can handle all potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input handling**: The program correctly reads the number of sofas, the dimensions of the matrix, the sofa coordinates, and the counts of sofas in relation to Grandpa Maks's sofa.
2. **Count Calculation**:
   - The program uses nested loops to compare each sofa with every other sofa, counting how many sofas are to the left, right, above, and below the current sofa.
   - The conditions for counting sofas in each direction seem to be logically sound:
     - **Right:** A sofa is to the right if its left cell is to the right of the rightmost cell of the current sofa.
     - **Left:** A sofa is to the left if its right cell is to the left of the leftmost cell of the current sofa.
     - **Top:** A sofa is above if its bottom cell is above the topmost cell of the current sofa.
     - **Bottom:** A sofa is below if its top cell is below the bottommost cell of the current sofa.
3. **Final Matching**: After calculating the counts, it checks if any sofa matches the conditions given by Grandpa Maks (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`) and returns the index (adjusted for 1-based indexing).

### Potential Edge Cases:
To evaluate the correctness of the code, consider the following test cases that examine different arrangements of sofas:

- **Case 1**: If there are two sofas sharing a common edge but positioned such that they are still counted correctly. Input:
    ```
    2
    2 2
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 2 2
    0 1 0 0
    ```
    Expected Output: `1` (the first sofa is correctly identified), as there are 0 sofas to the left, 1 to the right, 0 above, and 0 below.

- **Case 2**: A situation where all counts match perfectly with no conditions met:
    ```
    3
    3 3
    1 1 1 2
    2 1 2 2
    1 2 2 2
    1 1 1 1
    ```
    Expected Output: `-1` (there's no sofa that meets the output conditions but they all exist).

### Issue Found:
While the counting logic appears correct superficially and works for standard configurations, the code has a potential flaw based on incorrect counting checks for sofas lying exactly adjacent to each other, leading to possible miscounts.

For example, if a sofa's `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` conditions are such that:
- The counts might evaluate incorrectly if the indices are off by one, or if the logic checks cells that do not reflect the actual arrangement of the sofas.

This can introduce scenarios where it fails to identify the correct sofa or mistakenly marks one that shouldn't match.

### Conclusion:
After closely examining how the code processes the counts and attempts to derive the correct sofa number, I found that although it works for many cases, there are edge cases involving adjacent sofas which could potentially lead to incorrect outputs.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
