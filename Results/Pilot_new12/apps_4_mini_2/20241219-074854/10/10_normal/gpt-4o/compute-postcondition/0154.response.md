The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `target_sofa` becomes 0 + 1, which is 1. 

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `right_count` is a list, `left_count` is a list, `bottom_count` is a list, `top_count` is a list, `sofas` is a list containing exactly `d` sofa configurations, `target_sofa` is 1, `i` is 0, `d` is greater than 0, with `left_count[i]` equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` equal to `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` equal to `cnt_b`.

Output State: **`right_count` is a list, `left_count` is a list, `bottom_count` is a list, `top_count` is a list, `sofas` is a list containing exactly `d` sofa configurations, `target_sofa` is 1, `i` is 0, `d` is greater than 0, `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`.**
