The variable `d` is assigned the value `int(input().strip())`. This means `d` will now hold an integer value that is provided as input by the user. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`) remain unchanged. 

Since `d` can take any integer value in the range specified (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5), it is now a specific integer value based on user input.

Output State: **`d` is a user-provided integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers satisfying 1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m with (x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2); `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1.**
