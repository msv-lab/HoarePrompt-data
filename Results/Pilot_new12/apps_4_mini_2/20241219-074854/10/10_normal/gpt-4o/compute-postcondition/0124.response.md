Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, `bottom_count[2]` is increased by 1, and `top_count[2]` is increased by 1, while the current values of `y1` and `y2` remain less than `y1_j`.***
