The code appends a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. This does not affect the values of `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, or `y2`, but it updates the `sofas` variable. The previous state of `sofas` is unknown, but we know it will now include the new tuple. The conditions related to `d` and the input integers remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers, `sofas` includes an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
