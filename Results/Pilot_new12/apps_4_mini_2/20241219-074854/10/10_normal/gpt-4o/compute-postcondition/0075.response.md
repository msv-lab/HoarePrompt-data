Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[j]`. The current values of `y1` and `y2` are both less than `y1_j`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is also greater than `x2_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and `left_count[i]` is now 1 greater than its previous value. If the condition is not met, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged, and `left_count[i]` stays the same.***
