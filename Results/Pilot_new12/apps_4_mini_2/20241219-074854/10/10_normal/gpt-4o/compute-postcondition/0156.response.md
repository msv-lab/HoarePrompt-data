Postcondition: ***`right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, `top_count` are lists, `sofas` is a list containing exactly `d` sofa configurations, `target_sofa` is -1, and `i` is 0, where if `left_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` is equal to `cnt_b`, then `target_sofa` is updated to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
