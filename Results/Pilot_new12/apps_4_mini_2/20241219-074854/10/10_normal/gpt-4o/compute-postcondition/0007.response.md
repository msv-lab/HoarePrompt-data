The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned the result of `map(int, input().strip().split())`, which means they are input integers that will replace the previous values of these variables. The state of the other variable `d` is unchanged, but it is noted that `d` must still be greater than or equal to 1. The `sofas` variable, which holds a collection that includes tuples, receives an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. 

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` as input integers, while `sofas` will contain an additional tuple with these new values.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers, and `sofas` has an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` appended to it.**
