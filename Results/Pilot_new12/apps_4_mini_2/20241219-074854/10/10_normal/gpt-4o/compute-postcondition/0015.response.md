The variable `right_count` is assigned a list that contains `d` zeros, where `d` is a user-provided integer such that 1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^5. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a user-provided integer such that 1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^5; `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of integers; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are unchanged; `left_count` is a list of length `d` containing all zeros; `right_count` is a list of length `d` containing all zeros.**
