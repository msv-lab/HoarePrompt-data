According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. The loop will execute again if `d` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `d` must be greater than or equal to 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be at least 2. Additionally, since it is a for loop using a `_`, there are no changes to other state variables. The value of `d` will decrease by 1 after the next iteration. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `d` is now at least 2, and the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain unchanged while `sofas` still includes the tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers, `sofas` includes an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
