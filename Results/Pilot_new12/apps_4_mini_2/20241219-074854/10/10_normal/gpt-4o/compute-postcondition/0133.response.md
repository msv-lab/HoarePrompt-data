The statement `bottom_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `bottom_count[2]` by 1 since `i` is equal to 2 in the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state indicates that `bottom_count[2]` is now increased by 1, but we do not have the exact previous value of `bottom_count[2]`, so we will simply acknowledge that it has been modified.

Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned from `sofas[j]`, `bottom_count[2]` is increased by 1**.
