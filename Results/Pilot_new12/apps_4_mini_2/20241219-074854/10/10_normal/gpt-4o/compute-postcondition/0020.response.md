According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. For the loop to execute at least once, `d` must be at least 1. Since `d` is stated to be at least 1, the loop is set to run, starting with `j` initialized to 0. At the beginning of the loop, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` have been assigned values from `sofas[0]`. Therefore, the states that need to be defined for the loop execution are as follows:

- `d` is at least 1 to ensure the loop executes.
- `j` starts at 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.
- The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` hold specific values assigned from `sofas[0]`.

State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the respective values from `sofas[0]**
