The `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so now `top_count[0]` will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`, `top_count[0]` is increased by 1.**
