Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are all assigned the value from `sofas[0]`. The current value of `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, and the current value of `x2` is also greater than `x2_j`. Consequently, `right_count[i]` has been increased by 1.***
