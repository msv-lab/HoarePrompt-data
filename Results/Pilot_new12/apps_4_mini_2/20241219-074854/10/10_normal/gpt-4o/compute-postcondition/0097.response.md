The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so `right_count[1]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, so `d` remains at least 2, `j` remains 2, and the values assigned from `sofas[2]` to `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `right_count[1]` is increased by 1, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`.**
