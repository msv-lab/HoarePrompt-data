According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `d`. Since `j` has a current value of 0, the loop will execute again for `j` equal to 1 if `d` is at least 2. After the next iteration, `j` will be increased by 1, so `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must remain at least 2.

State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[j]`.**
