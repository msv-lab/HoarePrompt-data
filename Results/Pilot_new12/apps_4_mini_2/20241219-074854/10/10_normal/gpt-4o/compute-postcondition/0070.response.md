The variable `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, meaning we are targeting the second element (index 1) of the `right_count` list. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[j]`, both `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
