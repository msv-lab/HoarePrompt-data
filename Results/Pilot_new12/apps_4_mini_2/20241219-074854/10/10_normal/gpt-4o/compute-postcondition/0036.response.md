Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are all assigned the value from `sofas[0]`. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `bottom_count[0]` is increased by 1 and `top_count[0]` is the previous value plus 1. Otherwise, `bottom_count[0]` remains unchanged.***
