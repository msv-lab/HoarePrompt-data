The code assigns values from the tuple `sofas[j]` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. The current value of `j` is 1. The other variables (`d`, `i`, and any other variables not mentioned in this code snippet) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned from `sofas[j]`.**
