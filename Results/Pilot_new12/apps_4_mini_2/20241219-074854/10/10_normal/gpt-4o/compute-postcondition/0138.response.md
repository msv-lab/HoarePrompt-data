The code `continue` does not change the values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Instead, it will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no values have been modified or returned, the output state will reflect that the loop iteration has been skipped while maintaining the current values of all variables.

Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned from `sofas[j]`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
