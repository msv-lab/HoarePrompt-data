The variable `sofas` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables have been affected, as the code only modifies `sofas`. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the new value of `sofas`.

Output State: **`d` is a user-provided integer such that 1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^5; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers satisfying 1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ `n`, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ `m` with (x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2); `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` ≤ `d - 1; sofas is an empty list`**.
