Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count[1]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bottom_count[1]` is increased by 1 if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, and `left_count[1]` is increased by 1 if `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`.***
