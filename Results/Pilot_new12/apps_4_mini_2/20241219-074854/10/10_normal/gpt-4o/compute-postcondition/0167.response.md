The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined with empty parentheses. However, it processes several constraints on variables derived from the context mentioned. The relevant constraints are as follows:

- `d` is an integer such that \(1 \leq d \leq 10^5\).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\).
- Coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers satisfying \(1 \leq x1, x2 \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y1, y2 \leq m\) with the condition that \((x1, y1) \neq (x2, y2)\).
- Non-negative integers `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are specified such that \(0 \leq cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b \leq d - 1\).

The function does not have any specified return values based on the given output. As such, it will produce results based on different scenarios created by the aforementioned parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates under specific constraints related to integers `d`, `n`, `m`, coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and non-negative integers `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`, with certain conditions on those values. The precise return value is not defined in the provided context.**
