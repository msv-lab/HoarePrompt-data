The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; instead, it skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. The states of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are still assigned values from `sofas[2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
