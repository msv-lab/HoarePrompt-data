Postcondition: ***`right_count` is a list, `left_count` is a list, `bottom_count` is a list, `top_count` is a list, `sofas` is a list containing exactly `d` sofa configurations, `target_sofa` is -1, `i` is 0, `d` is greater than 0. The current values are such that `left_count[i]` equals `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` equals `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` equals `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` equals `cnt_b`.***
