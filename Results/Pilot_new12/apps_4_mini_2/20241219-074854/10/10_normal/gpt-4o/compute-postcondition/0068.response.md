The line `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]` assigns the values from the `sofas` array at index `j` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. The initial values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are derived from `sofas[1]`, and this line updates `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` based on the current index `j`. 

Since we do not know the specific contents of `sofas`, we can only state that `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will hold the values belonging to `sofas[j]`. The values of `j` have not changed; they remain as they were. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[j]`**.
