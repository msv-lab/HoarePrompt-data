The variable `target_sofa` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is currently 1. Therefore, `target_sofa` will be updated to `1 + 1`, which equals 2. The other variables `right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, `top_count`, and `sofas` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right_count` is a list; `left_count` is a list; `bottom_count` is a list; `top_count` is a list; `sofas` is a list containing exactly `d` sofa configurations; `target_sofa` is 2; `i` is 1.**
