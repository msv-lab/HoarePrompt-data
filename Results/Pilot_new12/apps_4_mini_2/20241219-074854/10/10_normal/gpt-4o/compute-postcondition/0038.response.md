The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. In this case, while the specific state of the loop is not given, it indicates that the program will bypass any remaining statements in the current iteration.

Since `continue` does not modify any variable values or state directly, the output state will simply reflect that the loop iteration is being skipped.

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are all assigned the value from `sofas[0]` and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
