The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instead skips the remainder of the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. Thus, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[j]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
