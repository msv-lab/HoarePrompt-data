Output State: **`right_count[i]` is the count of sofas `j` (excluding `i`) where `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`, `left_count[i]` is the count of sofas `j` where `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, `bottom_count[i]` is the count of sofas `j` where `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, `top_count[i]` is the count of sofas `j` where `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, `i` is 2, `j` has iterated through all indices from 0 to `d-1` (excluding `i`). `d` is at least 3, and if there were no sofas to compare, all counts would remain unchanged.**
