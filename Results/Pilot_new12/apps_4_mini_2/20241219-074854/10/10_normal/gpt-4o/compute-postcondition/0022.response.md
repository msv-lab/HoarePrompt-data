The code `continue` is used to skip to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. In this case, since `i` is equal to `j`, the `continue` statement will not change any variables directly. The values of `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, and we can deduce that the program is skipping some processing because `i` and `j` are equal, but they retain their respective values. 

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned the respective values from `sofas[0]`, and `i` is equal to `j`.**
