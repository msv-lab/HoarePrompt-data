The value of `target_sofa` is assigned the value `i + 1`. Given that `i` is currently 2, the new value of `target_sofa` will be 3 (2 + 1). The other variables, `right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, `top_count`, and `sofas` remain unchanged in this execution.

Output State: **`right_count` is a list, `left_count` is a list, `bottom_count` is a list, `top_count` is a list, `sofas` is a list containing exactly `d` sofa configurations, `target_sofa` is set to 3, and `i` is 2, and `d` must be greater than 2.**
