Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[j]`. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` has increased by 1, `top_count[i]` has increased by 1, `right_count[i]` has increased by 1 (if previous conditions regarding `x1` and `x2` were met), and `left_count[i]` is now 1 greater than its previous value. If the condition is not met, the program state for `bottom_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, and `left_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
