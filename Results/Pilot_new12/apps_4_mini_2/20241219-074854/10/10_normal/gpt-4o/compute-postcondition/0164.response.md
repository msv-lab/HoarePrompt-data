Postcondition: ***`right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` are lists, `sofas` is a list containing exactly `d` sofa configurations, `target_sofa` is set to 3, `i` is 2, and `d` must be greater than 2. If `left_count[i]` equals `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` equals `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` equals `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` equals `cnt_b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
