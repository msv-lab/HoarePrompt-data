Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `y1` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `x2` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `y2` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `x1_j` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `y1_j` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `x2_j` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `y2_j` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged.***
