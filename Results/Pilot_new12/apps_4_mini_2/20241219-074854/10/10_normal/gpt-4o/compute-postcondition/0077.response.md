Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[j]`. If `y1` and `y2` are both less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is increased by 1. If the previous conditions regarding `x1` and `x2` were met prior to this evaluation, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1 and `left_count[i]` is now 1 greater than its previous value. Otherwise, `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
