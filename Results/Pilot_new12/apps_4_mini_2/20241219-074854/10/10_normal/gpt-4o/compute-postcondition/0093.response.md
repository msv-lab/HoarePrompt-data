According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `d`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. Since `d` is at least 2, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2, and `d` must remain at least 2 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[2]`.**
