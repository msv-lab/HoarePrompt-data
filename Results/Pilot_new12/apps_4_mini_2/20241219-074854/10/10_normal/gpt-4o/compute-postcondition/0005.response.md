The `sofas` list is modified by appending a tuple consisting of the values `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, which are given as input integers. The initial state indicated that `d` must be greater than or equal to 1, while `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are provided as integers. The value of `sofas` before execution is not specified but after execution, it is known that it will contain an additional entry.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 1; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers; `sofas` has an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` appended to it.**
