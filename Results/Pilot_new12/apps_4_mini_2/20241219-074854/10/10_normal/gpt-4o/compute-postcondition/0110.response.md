The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since `continue` does not change the values of any variables but simply affects the flow of control within the loop, the output state will include all the existing information about the variables.

The relevant details affecting the program are:
- `d` is at least 3,
- `i` is 2,
- `j` is 0,
- `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` sofa configurations,
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` have been assigned values from `sofas[i]`, and since `i` equals `j`, this means `i` equals 0.

Since there are no changes to the variable values, we simply state the condition of looping.

Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` sofa configurations, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[0]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
