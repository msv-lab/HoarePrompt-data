Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, we can analyze the situation step by step.

- Initial State: 
  - `d` is at least 3
  - `i` is 2
  - `j` is 0
  - `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` sofa configurations

The code snippet `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]` performs tuple unpacking of the `j`-th element of the `sofas` list into the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Since `j` is 0, this means the first configuration in the `sofas` list will be unpacked into these variables.

Now we need to update the state accordingly:
- The specific indices being accessed (`sofas[0]`) will assign values to the `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` based on the first sofa configuration.

Since the precondition indicates `sofas` contains at least `d` configurations where `d` is at least 3, and we have not defined these configurations in detail, we can only mention that `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` now hold values that correspond to the first configuration of `sofas`.

No other variables (`d`, `i`, or `j`) have changed, therefore they remain the same.

Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` hold values from `sofas[0]`**.
