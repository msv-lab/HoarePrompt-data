The statement `left_count[i] += 1` increments the variable `left_count[i]` by 1. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, so `left_count[0]` will be modified. Other variables such as `d`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` retain their previous states, with `d` still being at least 1, and the conditions regarding `x1` and `x2` compared to `x2_j` remain intact.

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are all assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, and `left_count[0]` has been increased by 1.**
