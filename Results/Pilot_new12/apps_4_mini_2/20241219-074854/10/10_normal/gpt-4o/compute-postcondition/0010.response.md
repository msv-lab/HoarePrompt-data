The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are now assigned the values provided by the input, where the input is processed as integers using `map(int, input().strip().split())`. The precondition that `d` must be greater than or equal to 2 remains unchanged. The variable `sofas` will now include an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, but this is inferred rather than updated as it is a collection that will hold the new values.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the input integers, and `sofas` includes an additional tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` with their corresponding input values.**
