Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` hold values from `sofas[0]`. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `left_count[i]` and `bottom_count[2]` are both increased by 1, with the current values of `y1` and `y2` being less than `y1_j`. There is no else part.***
