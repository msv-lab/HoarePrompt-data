The values of `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are updated by mapping the input integers to their respective variables. Since the input consists of a single line of space-separated integers, the previous values of `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are replaced with the integers provided in the input. Other variables, such as `d` and `sofas`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a user-provided integer such that 1 â‰¤ `d` â‰¤ 10^5; `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of integers, where each tuple is in the form `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` representing input integers; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are updated to the provided input integers.**
