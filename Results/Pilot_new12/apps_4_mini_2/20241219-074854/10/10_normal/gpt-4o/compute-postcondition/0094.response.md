The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. As a result, there are no changes to the state of the defined variables `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. The program continues executing the loop without modifying any variable values or making any calculations.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
