Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`. If `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `bottom_count[2]` remains unchanged and `top_count[2]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bottom_count[2]` remains unchanged.***
