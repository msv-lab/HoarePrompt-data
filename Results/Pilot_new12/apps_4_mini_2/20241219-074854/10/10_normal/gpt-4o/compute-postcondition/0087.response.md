The statement `left_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. The initial values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged, and `right_count[1]` is unaffected by this code. Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `left_count[i]` while retaining all other preconditions.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[1]`, `left_count[i]` has been incremented by 1.**
