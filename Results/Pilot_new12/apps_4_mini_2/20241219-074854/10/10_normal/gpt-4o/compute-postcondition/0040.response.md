The variable `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values corresponding to `sofas[j]`. Given the initial state that `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the other variables are also initialized with values from `sofas[0]`, since `i` does not equal `j`, the code will execute without skipping.

Therefore, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will now hold the values from `sofas[1]`.

The output state will include `d` (at least 1), `i` (0), `j` (1), and the new values for `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`, which are set based on the values from `sofas[j]`.

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`.**
