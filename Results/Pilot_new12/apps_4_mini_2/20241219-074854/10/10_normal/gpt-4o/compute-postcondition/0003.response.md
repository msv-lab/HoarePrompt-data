To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided state and the for loop:

1. **Loop Structure:** The loop is defined as `for _ in range(d)`. This suggests that the loop will iterate `d` times. 

2. **Current State Conditions:**
   - The integer `d` is user-provided, and the requirements indicate that it must satisfy the condition `1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5`. This means that, in order for the loop to execute, `d` must be at least `1`.
   - The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, and `sofas`) are provided with specific constraints, but these do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

3. **Loop Iteration Initialization:** The variable `_` in the loop does not require any specific initialization since it is a placeholder for loop iteration, which will go from `0` to `d-1` based on the value of `d`.

4. **Conclusion:** 
   - Thus, the only necessary condition that affects the execution of the loop is that `d` must be at least `1` to ensure the loop runs.

Therefore, we can summarize the needed states for the loop to execute.

State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 1**
