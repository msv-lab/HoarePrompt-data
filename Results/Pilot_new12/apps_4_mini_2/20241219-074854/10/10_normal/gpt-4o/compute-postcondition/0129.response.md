The variable `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 2, this means that `right_count[2]` is updated by adding 1 to its previous value. The values of `d`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are not directly affected by this operation. 

Thus, the Output State is: `d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned from `sofas[j]`, and `right_count[2]` is increased by 1.
