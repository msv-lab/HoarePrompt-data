The `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` variables are assigned values from the `input` function, which reads a line of input, strips it of leading/trailing whitespace, splits it into separate strings, and then maps them to integers. Since there is no precondition provided for the input values, we cannot derive any specific numerical relationships or constraints.

Given that `d` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the impact on the program involves reading new values into the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, the other variables and their previous values are not impacted. 

Thus, the Output State must include the update that `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` now hold values based on user input as integers, while maintaining that `d` remains at least 1.

Output State: **`d` must be greater than or equal to 1; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers.**
