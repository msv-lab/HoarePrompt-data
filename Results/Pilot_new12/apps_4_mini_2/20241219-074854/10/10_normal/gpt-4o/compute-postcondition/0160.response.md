Postcondition: ***`right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` are lists, `sofas` is a list containing exactly `d` sofa configurations, `target_sofa` is set to 2, and `i` is 1. If the values at index `i` in `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` match `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` respectively, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
