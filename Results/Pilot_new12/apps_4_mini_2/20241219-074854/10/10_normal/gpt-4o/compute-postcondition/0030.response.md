Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are all assigned the value from `sofas[0]`. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is also greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[0]` is increased by 1; otherwise, `left_count[0]` remains unchanged.***
