According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the variable `j` is less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `d` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

So the new value of `j` should be 1. Since there are no changes to the other mentioned variables (`i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`) that impact the loop conditions, they will retain their previous values.

State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are all assigned the value from `sofas[0]`**
