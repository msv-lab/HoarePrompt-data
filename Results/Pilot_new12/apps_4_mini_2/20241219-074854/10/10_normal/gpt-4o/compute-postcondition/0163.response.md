The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `right_count` is a list, `left_count` is a list, `bottom_count` is a list, `top_count` is a list, `sofas` is a list containing exactly `d` sofa configurations, `target_sofa` is set to 3, `i` is 2, and `d` must be greater than 2; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
