According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the variable `d`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `d` is at least 3, indicating that the loop can run at least two more times (for `j` values of 1 and 2). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1. Since `d` remains at least 3, the loop can still execute.

State: **`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
