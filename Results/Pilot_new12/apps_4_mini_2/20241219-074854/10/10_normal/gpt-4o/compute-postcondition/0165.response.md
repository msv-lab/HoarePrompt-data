Output State: **`right_count`, `left_count`, `bottom_count`, and `top_count` are lists, `sofas` is a list containing exactly `d` sofa configurations, and `target_sofa` is set to the smallest index (1-based) of a sofa configuration for which `left_count[i]` equals `cnt_l`, `right_count[i]` equals `cnt_r`, `top_count[i]` equals `cnt_t`, and `bottom_count[i]` equals `cnt_b`. If no such index exists, `target_sofa` remains -1. `d` is the total number of configurations.**
