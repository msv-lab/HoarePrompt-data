The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables and instead skips the current iteration of the loop. Thus, `d`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and we stay on the same iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
