Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `y1` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `x2` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `y2` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `x1_j` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `y1_j` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `x2_j` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]`, `y2_j` is assigned the value from `sofas[0]` since `i` equals `j`. The current value of `x1` is less than `x1_j`, and the current value of `x2` is also less than `x1_j`.***
