The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `d`, `i`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. The variable `i` is equal to 1, so `right_count[1]` is the one being incremented. The initial condition that `d` is at least 2 remains valid after execution.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are now values from `sofas[1]`, `right_count[1]` has been incremented by 1.**
