Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` hold values from `sofas[0]`, the current values of `y1` and `y2` are both greater than `y2_j`, and `y1` is greater than `y1_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`. As a result, `left_count[i]` and `bottom_count[2]` have both been increased by 1. Additionally, the current values of `y1` and `y2` remain less than `y1_j`.***
