The variable `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is currently 0, this means `left_count[0]` will have its value increased by 1. The values of other variables remain unaffected during this operation, including `d`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to `left_count[0]`.

Output State: **`d` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[1]`, `left_count[0]` is incremented by 1.**
