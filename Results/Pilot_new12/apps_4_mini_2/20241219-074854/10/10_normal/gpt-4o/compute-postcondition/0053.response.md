The statement `right_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `right_count[i]` by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so we are updating `right_count[0]` by increasing its count. The values of `d`, `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are assigned values from `sofas[2]`, and `right_count[0]` is increased by 1.**
