Postcondition: ***`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are values from `sofas[j]`. The values of `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`. Consequently, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1. If `x1` was previously less than `x1_j` and `x2` was also less than `x1_j`, those conditions no longer hold true. `right_count[i]` reflects this increment.***
