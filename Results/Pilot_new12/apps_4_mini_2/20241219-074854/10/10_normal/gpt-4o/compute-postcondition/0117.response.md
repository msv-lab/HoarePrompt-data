The statement `left_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. The initial state indicates that `d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and the various `x` and `y` variables hold values from `sofas[0]`. The only variable affected by the executed code is `left_count[i]`, which will now be one greater than its previous value.

Since the initial values of `left_count` are not stated, we cannot specify an exact value after the increment; we can only express the change that has occurred.

Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` hold values from `sofas[0]`, and `left_count[i]` has been increased by 1.**
