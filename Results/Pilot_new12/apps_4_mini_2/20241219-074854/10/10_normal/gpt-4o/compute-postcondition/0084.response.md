The values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned from the corresponding values in `sofas[j]`. Since there is no modification to the other variables, the output state will reflect the updated values for `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`, which depend on the values stored in `sofas[j]`. 

Given that `j` is 1, the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` can be taken directly from the `sofas` data structure.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are now values from `sofas[1]`**.
