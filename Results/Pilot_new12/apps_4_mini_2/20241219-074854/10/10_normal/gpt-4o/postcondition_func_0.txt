The function reads input to determine the configuration of multiple sofas based on their coordinates. It accepts user-provided integers for the number of sofa configurations `d`, and two additional integers `n` and `m` that define the space within which sofas are placed. Following this, the function collects the coordinates of `d` sofas in the form of tuples. Then, it retrieves counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`) which specify how many sofas are located in specific relative positions. The function computes counts for each sofa in relation to all other sofas based on these countsâ€”specifically how many sofas are to the left, right, above, and below each sofa. After calculating these counts, the function checks if any sofa meets the criteria defined by `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`. If such a sofa is found, it prints the 1-based index of the first sofa that matches these criteria. If no sofa meets the criteria, it prints -1. The function does not return any values but outputs the index directly. It does not handle invalid inputs explicitly, thus edge cases related to input validation are not addressed in the function.
