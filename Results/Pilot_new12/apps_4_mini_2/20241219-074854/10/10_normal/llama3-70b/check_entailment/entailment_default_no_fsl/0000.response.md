Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly account for the condition where sofas are adjacent to each other. According to the problem description, a sofa A is to the left of a sofa B if there are coordinate conditions that ensure it is not only that A has a lower x-coordinate than Bâ€™s x-coordinate but also that A is not directly adjacent. However, the function `func_1` counts sofas that are immediately adjacent (i.e., they share the same row or column) as "to the left", "to the right", "to the top", or "to the bottom."

For example, consider the input:
```
2
2 2
1 1 1 2
1 2 2 2
1 1 0 0
```
Using the above inputs:
- The first sofa is at (1,1) and (1,2).
- The second sofa is at (1,2) and (2,2).

Here, the first sofa has 0 to the left, 1 to the right, 0 to the top, and 0 to the bottom, which would not align with the required (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`). 

Therefore, since this counting does not follow the problem's rules for all potential cases, the program does not work correctly in every situation and thus has partial correctness issues.
