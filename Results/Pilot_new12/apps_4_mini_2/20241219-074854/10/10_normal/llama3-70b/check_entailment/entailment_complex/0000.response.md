The annotated program aims to implement the functionality required by the problem description, where it identifies Grandpa Maks's sofa based on its relative position to other sofas in a matrix. Here’s an evaluation of its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of sofas (`d`), the dimensions of the storehouse (`n`, `m`), the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts of sofas on each side of Grandpa Maks's sofa.

2. **Sofa Representation**:
   - Each sofa is represented as a tuple of its coordinates (two pairs for the two cells it occupies). This aligns with the problem’s requirement that every sofa takes two neighboring cells.

3. **Counting Relative Positions**:
   - The `func_1` function iterates through the list of sofas and compares their coordinates with those of the current sofa to check how many sofas are positioned relative to it (left, right, top, or bottom). This matches the problem’s demand to count how many sofas are in each direction relative to a given sofa.

4. **Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if the counts obtained from `func_1` for a particular sofa match the expected counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`). If it finds a match, it outputs the index of that sofa. If no match is found after checking all sofas, it correctly prints `-1`.

5. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The checking conditions within `func_1` seem accurate:
     - Left: `sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]` correctly identifies sofas to the left.
     - Right: `sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]` correctly identifies sofas to the right.
     - Top: `sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]` correctly identifies sofas above.
     - Bottom: `sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]` correctly identifies sofas below.

6. **Uniqueness Guarantee**:
   - The problem guarantees that there is at most one sofa meeting the conditions laid out by `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`, and the program is structured to find and return that unique sofa or `-1` if none exists.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements all the requirements set forth in the problem description. It appropriately reads the input, processes the data to count relative positions, and outputs the correct sofa number or `-1` when no match is found.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
