sofa is an integer representing the number of sofas (1 ≤ sofa ≤ 10^5), sofas is a list of tuples containing four integers each (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of each sofa (1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y1, y2 ≤ m), and there are four integers cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b (0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ sofa - 1) representing the count of sofas in different directions.
