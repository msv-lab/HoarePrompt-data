#State of the program right berfore the function call: sofa is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of the sofas, and sofas is a tuple of four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) representing the count of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa respectively. The values of d, n, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5.
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left, right, top, bottom = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for s in sofas:
        if s != sofa:
            if sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                left += 1
            if sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] and sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]:
                right += 1
            if sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                top += 1
            if sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] and sofa[0][0] == s[0][0]:
                bottom += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `left` is the number of sofas to the left of the first tuple in `sofa`, `right` is the number of sofas to the right of the first tuple in `sofa`, `top` is the number of sofas above the first tuple in `sofa`, and `bottom` is the number of sofas below the first tuple in `sofa`. If `sofas` has at least one tuple that is not equal to `sofa`, the loop will execute for every tuple in `sofas`. If `sofas` is empty or contains only `sofa`, the loop will not execute and all counts will remain at their initial values of 0.
    return left, right, top, bottom
    #The program returns the values of left, right, top, and bottom, which represent the counts of sofas to the left, right, above, and below the first tuple in `sofa`, respectively. If `sofas` is empty or contains only `sofa`, all counts remain at their initial values of 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, `sofa`, representing the coordinates of a specific sofa and a tuple, `sofas`, containing coordinates of other sofas. It counts the number of other sofas to the left, right, above, and below the first tuple in `sofa`. The counts are determined based on the conditions that compare their coordinates with those of the first sofa in the list. If `sofas` is empty or consists only of the specific `sofa`, all counts will remain at their initialized values of 0. The function ultimately returns four integers representing the counts of sofas in each respective direction. Note that the function may not account for sofas that are directly adjacent (i.e., the same position in the relevant axis), as it's only counting those that are strictly greater or less.
