Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers. If the second integer of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the second integer of the second tuple in `s` and the first integer of the first tuple in `sofa` equals the first integer of the second tuple in `s`, then `bottom` is increased by 1, while `left`, `top`, and `s` remain unchanged. If the condition is not met, `left`, `top`, `bottom`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
