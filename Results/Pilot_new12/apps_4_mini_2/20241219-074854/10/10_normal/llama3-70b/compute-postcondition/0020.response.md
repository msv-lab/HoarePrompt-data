Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers, `s` is the second tuple in `sofas`. If the first integer of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first integer of the second tuple in `s` and the second integer of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second integer of the second tuple in `s`, then `left` remains unchanged and `right` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged and `right` does not change.***
