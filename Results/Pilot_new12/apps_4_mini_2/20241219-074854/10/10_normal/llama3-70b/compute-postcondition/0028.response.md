Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples, `s` is the next tuple in the list `sofas` that corresponds to the next element, `bottom` and `top` remain unchanged, and if the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `left` is incremented by 1.***
