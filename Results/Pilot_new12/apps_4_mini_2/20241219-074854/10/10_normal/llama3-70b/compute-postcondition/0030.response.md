Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples, `s` is the next tuple in the list `sofas`, `bottom` and `top` remain unchanged; if the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `left` is incremented by 1 and `right` is incremented by 1.***
