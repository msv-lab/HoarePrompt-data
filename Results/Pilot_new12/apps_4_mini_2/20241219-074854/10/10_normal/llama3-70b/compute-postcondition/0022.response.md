Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers, `s` is the second tuple in `sofa`, `left` remains unchanged, `top` is increased by 1 if the first integer of the first tuple in `sofa` is less than the first integer of the second tuple in `s` and the second integer of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second integer of the second tuple in `s`. If the condition is not met, `left` remains unchanged and `top` does not change.***
