Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers, `s` is the second tuple in `sofas`, and `sofas` has at least 2 elements. If the first integer of the first tuple in `sofa` is less than the first integer of the second tuple in `s` and the second integer of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second integer of the second tuple in `s`, then `left` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged.***
