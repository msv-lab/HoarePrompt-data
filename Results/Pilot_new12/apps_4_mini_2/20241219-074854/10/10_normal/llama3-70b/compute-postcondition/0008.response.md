Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers. `sofas` is a tuple of four integers that must have at least one element. `s` is the first element of `sofas` and is not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, `left` is increased by 1 and `right` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged and `right` remains unchanged.***
