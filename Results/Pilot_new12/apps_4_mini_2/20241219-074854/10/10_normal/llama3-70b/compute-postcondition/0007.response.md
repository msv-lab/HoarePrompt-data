The code increments the value of `right` by 1. The initial conditions still hold true, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `right`.

Output State: **`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers, `sofas` is a tuple of four integers that must have at least one element, `s` is the first element of `sofas`, `s` is not equal to `sofa`, the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s`, the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, `left` has been increased by 1, `right` has been increased by 1.**
