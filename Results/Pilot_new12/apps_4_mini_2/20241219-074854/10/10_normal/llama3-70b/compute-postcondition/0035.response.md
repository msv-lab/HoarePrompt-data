Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples, `s` is the next tuple in `sofa`, and `bottom` remains unchanged. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `top` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `top` remains unchanged.***
