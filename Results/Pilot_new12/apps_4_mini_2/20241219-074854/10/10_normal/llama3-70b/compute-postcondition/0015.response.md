Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers, `s` is a tuple of four integers not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, then `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are increased by 1. Otherwise, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.***
