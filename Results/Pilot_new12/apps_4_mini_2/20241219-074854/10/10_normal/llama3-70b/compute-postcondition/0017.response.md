The value of `left` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `left` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state indicates that `left` is now increased by 1. 

Output State: **`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers, `s` is the second tuple in `sofas`, and `left` is increased by 1.**
