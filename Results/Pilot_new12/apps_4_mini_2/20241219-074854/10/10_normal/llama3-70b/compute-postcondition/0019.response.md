The `right` variable is incremented by 1, but the states of the other variables (`sofa`, `s`, and `left`) are not affected by this code snippet. The condition mentioned is not directly invoked in this code section. Therefore, the output state retains the precondition for `sofa`, `s`, and `left`.

Output State: **`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers, `s` is the second tuple in `sofas`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` is increased by 1.**
