The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa`, which is a list of tuples, and `sofas`, which is a tuple of four integers. The `sofa` list consists of tuples where each tuple contains four integers representing coordinates. The `sofas` tuple contains counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If the `sofas` tuple is empty or if it only contains the `sofa`, the function returns counts of 0 for all directions (left, right, top, bottom). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the list of sofas and return the counts of sofas positioned to the left, right, above, and below the first tuple in `sofa`, while handling cases where the `sofas` parameter does not provide additional information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `sofa` representing sofa coordinates and a tuple `sofas` representing counts of sofas in four directions. It returns the counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of the first sofa in the list, which are 0 if `sofas` is empty or contains only `sofa`.**
