Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers; `s` is a tuple of four integers not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, then `left`, `right`, and `top` are each increased by 1, and `bottom` is also increased by 1. If the condition is not met, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.***
