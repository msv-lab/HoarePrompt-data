Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, `sofa`, representing the coordinates of a specific sofa and a tuple, `sofas`, containing coordinates of other sofas. It counts the number of other sofas to the left, right, above, and below the first tuple in `sofa`. The counts are determined based on the conditions that compare their coordinates with those of the first sofa in the list. If `sofas` is empty or consists only of the specific `sofa`, all counts will remain at their initialized values of 0. The function ultimately returns four integers representing the counts of sofas in each respective direction. Note that the function may not account for sofas that are directly adjacent (i.e., the same position in the relevant axis), as it's only counting those that are strictly greater or less.**
