Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers, `s` is the first element of a tuple of four integers, and `s` is not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is greater than the first element of `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of `s`, then `left`, `right`, and `top` are each increased by 1. Otherwise, `left`, `right`, and `top` remain unchanged.***
