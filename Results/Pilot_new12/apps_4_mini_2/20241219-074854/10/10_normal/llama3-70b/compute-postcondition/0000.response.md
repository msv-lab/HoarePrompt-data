The variables `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are initialized to 0. The other variables—`sofa` as a list of tuples representing coordinates and `sofas` as a tuple for counts—remain unchanged. Since the code only changes the values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`, and initializes them to 0, the output state will reflect this change while retaining the values of the preconditions.

Output State: **`sofa` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2), `sofas` is a tuple of four integers (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b), `d`, `n`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0.**
