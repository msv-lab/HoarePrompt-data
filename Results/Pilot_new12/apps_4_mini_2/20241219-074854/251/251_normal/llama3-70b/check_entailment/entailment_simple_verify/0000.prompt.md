You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (r, h) = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    print(dp[-1])


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program concerning the problem description, let's analyze the program and its logic:

The program's primary goal is to calculate the maximum possible volume of a "special cake" that Babaei can create by stacking cakes based on certain constraints:

1. A cake can only be placed on a larger indexed cake.
2. A cake can only be placed on top of another cake if its volume is strictly greater.

Now, let's look at the key points in the provided code:

- The input is read and stored in a list of tuples, each representing the volume (`math.pi * r^2 * h`), radius, and height of each cake.
- The cakes are sorted by volume in descending order.
- A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to store the maximum volume obtainable by placing each cake.
- The program iterates through each cake and checks if one can be placed atop another based on the radius and height (both must be smaller).

### Potential Flaw in Logic:
However, there is a critical logical error in the program's placement condition:

- The check for placing cake i on cake j is solely based on the radius and height being smaller (`cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`). This does not consider the actual volume of the cakes being checked, which is essential to ensure that cakes are stacked properly.

#### Counterexample:
Consider a case with the following cakes:

```
3
2 2
3 1
4 1
```
Calculating their volumes:
- Cake 1: Volume = π * 2^2 * 2 = 8π
- Cake 2: Volume = π * 3^2 * 1 = 9π
- Cake 3: Volume = π * 4^2 * 1 = 16π

In this scenario:
- Cake 3 cannot be placed on Cake 1 because its height isn't less.
- Cake 2 cannot be placed on either cake.
- However, if we allow and check only for volume constraints, we can create a stack from Cake 1 and Cake 2.

Given these stacked conditions are not properly checked, the program may yield incorrect outputs when dealing with cakes that fulfill the volume condition but fail under the height/radius conditions alone.

### Conclusion:
Because of this flaw, the program does not correctly fulfill the problem requirements in all possible cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; each of the following n lines contains two integers r_i and h_i representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, where 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple is in the format `(volume, r, h)`, with `volume` calculated as `math.pi * r * r * h` for each input pair of integers `r` and `h`.
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the maximum cake values achievable based on the non-dominated conditions from the `cakes` list. The value `dp[i]` for each `i` (from 0 to n-1) is equal to the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and the sum of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for all valid `j` where `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and if `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, keeping `dp[0]` as `cakes[0][0]` and all other elements of `dp` as 0.0.
    print(dp[-1])


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
