You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; each of the following n lines contains two integers r_i and h_i representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, where 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple is in the format `(volume, r, h)`, with `volume` calculated as `math.pi * r * r * h` for each input pair of integers `r` and `h`.
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the maximum cake values achievable based on the non-dominated conditions from the `cakes` list. The value `dp[i]` for each `i` (from 0 to n-1) is equal to the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and the sum of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for all valid `j` where `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and if `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, keeping `dp[0]` as `cakes[0][0]` and all other elements of `dp` as 0.0.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) representing the number of cakes, followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the radius `r_i` and height `h_i` (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000) for each cake. It computes the volume of each cake using the formula `math.pi * r * r * h` and stores these volumes in a list along with their respective radius and height as tuples. After sorting the list of cakes in descending order of volume, the function calculates the maximum achievable total volume of cakes that can be stacked under the condition that a cake can only be placed on another if both its radius and height are strictly less. The function outputs the maximum total volume of cake that can be achieved based on these stacking conditions. In the case where `n` is 1, it simply returns the volume of the single cake as the output. The function does not return a value; it prints the result directly to the console. It does not handle any malformed input cases or constraints violations, assuming the input adheres to the specified ranges.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
