The function reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) representing the number of cakes, followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the radius `r_i` and height `h_i` (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000) for each cake. It computes the volume of each cake using the formula `math.pi * r * r * h` and stores these volumes in a list along with their respective radius and height as tuples. After sorting the list of cakes in descending order of volume, the function calculates the maximum achievable total volume of cakes that can be stacked under the condition that a cake can only be placed on another if both its radius and height are strictly less. The function outputs the maximum total volume of cake that can be achieved based on these stacking conditions. In the case where `n` is 1, it simply returns the volume of the single cake as the output. The function does not return a value; it prints the result directly to the console. It does not handle any malformed input cases or constraints violations, assuming the input adheres to the specified ranges.
