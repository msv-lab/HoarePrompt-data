#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; each of the following n lines contains two integers r_i and h_i representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, where 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple is in the format `(volume, r, h)`, with `volume` calculated as `math.pi * r * r * h` for each input pair of integers `r` and `h`.
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` contains the maximum cake values achievable based on the non-dominated conditions from the `cakes` list. The value `dp[i]` for each `i` (from 0 to n-1) is equal to the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and the sum of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for all valid `j` where `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and if `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, keeping `dp[0]` as `cakes[0][0]` and all other elements of `dp` as 0.0.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) representing the number of cakes, followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the radius `r_i` and height `h_i` (1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000) for each cake. It computes the volume of each cake using the formula `math.pi * r * r * h` and stores these volumes in a list along with their respective radius and height as tuples. After sorting the list of cakes in descending order of volume, the function calculates the maximum achievable total volume of cakes that can be stacked under the condition that a cake can only be placed on another if both its radius and height are strictly less. The function outputs the maximum total volume of cake that can be achieved based on these stacking conditions. In the case where `n` is 1, it simply returns the volume of the single cake as the output. The function does not return a value; it prints the result directly to the console. It does not handle any malformed input cases or constraints violations, assuming the input adheres to the specified ranges.
