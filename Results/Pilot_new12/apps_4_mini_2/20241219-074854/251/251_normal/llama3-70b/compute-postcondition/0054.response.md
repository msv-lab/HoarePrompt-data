Output State: **`dp` contains the maximum cake values achievable based on the non-dominated conditions from the `cakes` list. The value `dp[i]` for each `i` (from 0 to n-1) is equal to the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and the sum of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` for all valid `j` where `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and if `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, keeping `dp[0]` as `cakes[0][0]` and all other elements of `dp` as 0.0.**
