According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `j` will iterate over the range determined by `i`. Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute exactly once, with `j` taking the value of 0 during that iteration. 

Before the loop starts, we already have that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1. The value of `dp[1]` is already set to `cakes[1][0]`, so it appears that all necessary conditions for the loop to run are already met. 

However, we can specify the values involved more explicitly:
- `j` will start from 0 before any iterations occur, as it is initialized by the `range(i)`.
- The index `j` should be explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, the adjustments can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `dp[1]` is assigned the value of `cakes[1][0]`**
