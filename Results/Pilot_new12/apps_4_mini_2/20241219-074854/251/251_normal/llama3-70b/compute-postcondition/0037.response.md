According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `j` can be incremented while still satisfying the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is specified to be at least 1, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Also, for the loop to execute, the condition `j < i` must still hold. Therefore, `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is at least 1; `j` is 2 and `i` must be greater than 2**
