According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and the current index `i`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index, and since the loop starts at `1`, `i` must be a value between `1` and `n-1`. 

Given that `dp[i]` contains the maximum cake value achieved up to index `i-1`, `i` will be incremented by `1` for the next iteration. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` after incrementation.

If at the end of the last iteration `n` is greater than `i`, and `i` increments, making `i` equal to the next higher index, the conditions still must hold: `n` must remain greater than `i + 1`. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, `i` would be adjusted from the previous value (let's call it `i`) to `i + 1`.

State: **`dp[i]` contains the maximum cake value that can be achieved using the cakes that satisfy the conditions based on their indices from `0` to `i-1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
