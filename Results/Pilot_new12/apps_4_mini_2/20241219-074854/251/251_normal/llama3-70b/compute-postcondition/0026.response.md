Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `dp[1]` is the maximum value based on previous calculations. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[3]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[0] + cakes[3][0]`.***
