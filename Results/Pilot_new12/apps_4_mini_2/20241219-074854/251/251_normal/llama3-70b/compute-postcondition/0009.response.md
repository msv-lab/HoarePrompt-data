The code snippet takes input values for `r` and `h`, assigning them to the respective variables. The initial state provided indicates that `cakes` has been updated with a new tuple that incorporates `r` and `h`. However, the specific values of `r` and `h` were not initially given; instead, they will now be set based on user input. The initial states of `n`, `_`, and `cakes` are unaffected by the input handling.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `_` is 2, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, and `cakes` includes an additional tuple \( ( \text{math.pi} \times r \times r \times h, r, h )**
