According to the code provided, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over the variable `j`, which goes from 0 up to (but not including) `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, which means that the range for `j` is from 0 to 0 (it doesn't actually execute any iterations). 

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be increased to 2, because the for loop will have no further iterations if `i` remains 1, as it won't enter the loop if `j` does not have any more values to iterate over.

So, we can conclude:
- `i` must be increased to 2 for the loop to have a chance to execute again.
- `j` in this case will then take the value of 0 in the next potential iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `dp[1]` is the maximum value based on previous calculations**
