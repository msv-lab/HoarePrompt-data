Output State: **`dp[i]` contains the maximum cake value that can be achieved using the cakes that satisfy the conditions based on their indices from `0` to `i-1`. The values of `cakes` should meet the conditions `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` for any valid `j`. `n` must be greater than the index `i` for the loop to execute; if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute and `dp[i]` retains its initial assigned value.**
