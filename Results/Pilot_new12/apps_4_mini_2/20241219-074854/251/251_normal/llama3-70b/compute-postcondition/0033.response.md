Postcondition: ***`dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is at least 1, and `j` is 0. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is now the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. The values of `cakes[i][1]`, `cakes[i][2]`, `cakes[j][1]`, and `cakes[j][2]` remain unchanged.***
