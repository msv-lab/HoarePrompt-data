Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `dp[1]` is initially assigned the value of `cakes[1][0]`, if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[1]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[0] + cakes[1][0]`.***
