Postcondition: ***`dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]` when `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`. `n` remains greater than 2, and `i` is at least 2. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
