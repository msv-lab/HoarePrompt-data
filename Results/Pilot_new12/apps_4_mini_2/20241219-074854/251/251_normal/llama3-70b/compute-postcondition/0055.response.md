Given the provided initial state, the code snippet's effect will relate strictly to outputting the last element of the `dp` list, which contains the maximum cake values. Since the code does not modify any value and only retrieves and prints `dp[-1]`, the internal state of the other variables remains unchanged.

The output state will reflect that the last item of the `dp` list is printed as it is, keeping the context that `dp` contains the maximum cake values.

Output State: **`dp` contains the maximum cake values achievable based on the non-dominated conditions from the `cakes` list, and `dp[-1]` is printed.**
