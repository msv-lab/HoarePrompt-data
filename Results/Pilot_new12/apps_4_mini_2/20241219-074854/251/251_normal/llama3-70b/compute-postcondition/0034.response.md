According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range specified by `i`. Since `j` starts at 0 and goes up to `i-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `j` to increment by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which indicates that itâ€™s about to enter the loop for the first time. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to 1. 

Also, we need to ensure that the conditions based on `cakes[i][1]`, `cakes[i][2]`, `cakes[j][1]`, and `cakes[j][2]` remain unchanged. The value of `i` must also be adjusted accordingly to ensure that `n > i` still holds true and that it permits further iterations if necessary.

Thus, the adjusted states will be:

State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is at least 1, and `j` is 1**
