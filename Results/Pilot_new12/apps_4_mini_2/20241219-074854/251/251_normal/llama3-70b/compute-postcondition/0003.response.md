The variables `r` and `h` are assigned input values through a split of a string, which are then converted to integers. The variables `n` and `_` remain unaffected by this operation. The value of `r` and `h` will be the integers that are input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100,000), `_` is 0 at the start of the first iteration, `r` and `h` are input integers**
