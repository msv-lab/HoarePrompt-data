According to the code, the for loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The loop will iterate `n` times as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `cakes` is an empty list, it does not affect the execution of the loop. However, we must acknowledge the value of `_`, which will take values from 0 up to `n-1` during the iterations.

For the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1 to ensure there are iterations to go through. At the end of the last iteration, `_` will be `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `_` is 0 at the start of the first iteration**
