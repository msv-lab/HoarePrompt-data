Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value obtained by summing `cakes[i][0]` with `dp[j]` for all valid `j` where `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`. `n` remains greater than 2, and `i` is at least 2. If no conditions are fulfilled during the iterations, `dp[i]` remains equal to its initial value `cakes[i][0]`.**
