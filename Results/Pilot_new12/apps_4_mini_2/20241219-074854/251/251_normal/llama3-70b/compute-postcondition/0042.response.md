The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `cakes[i][0]`, which means that `dp[i]` is now equal to the first element of `cakes` at index `i`. The value of `dp[i]` was previously based on the maximum calculated value from previous cakes but will now overwrite that with `cakes[i][0]`. Therefore, while `dp[i]` is updated, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is now equal to `cakes[i][0]`; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is at least 2.**
