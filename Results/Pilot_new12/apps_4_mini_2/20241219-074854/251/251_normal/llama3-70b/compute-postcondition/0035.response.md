The line of code updates `dp[i]` with the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `cakes[i][0]`. Given that `dp[i]` is initially equal to `cakes[i][0]`, the new value of `dp[i]` will depend on the value of `dp[j]`.

The conditions specify that `n` is greater than `i + 1` (indicating that there are more elements), `i` is at least 1 (meaning it's not the first index), and `j` is 1 (indicating the index of the comparison). Since `dp[i]` has a specific initial state equal to `cakes[i][0]`, we must include that relationship explicitly in the output state.

1. Determine the value of `dp[j]`, which is the only necessary additional information to complete the calculation of `dp[i]`.
2. Calculate the updated value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `max(cakes[i][0], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`; `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 1.**
