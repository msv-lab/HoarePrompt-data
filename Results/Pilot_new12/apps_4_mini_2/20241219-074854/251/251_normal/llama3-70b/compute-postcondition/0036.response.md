Postcondition: ***`dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain as specified: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is at least 1, and `j` is 1.***
