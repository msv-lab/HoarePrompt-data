The list `dp` is initialized with `n` elements, all set to `0.0`. `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100,000, and it specifies the length of the list. The state of `cakes` remains unchanged as the initialization of `dp` does not affect it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on `volume`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to `0.0`.**
