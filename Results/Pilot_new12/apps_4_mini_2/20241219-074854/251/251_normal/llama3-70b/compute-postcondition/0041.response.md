According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. Since the loop starts at i = 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1 and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If we increase `i` by 1 for the next iteration, then `i` will be at least 2. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`dp[i]` is the maximum calculated value based on previous cakes that meet the comparison criteria, initialized to `cakes[i][0]`; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is at least 2.**
