According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute again depends on the variable `j` and its relation to `i`. Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i-1`, the loop can execute again only if `j` is less than `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `i` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing as required, `i` must be at least 4 to allow `j` to be within the range.

Thus, the adjusted states will be:
- `j` is now 3, ensuring the loop can run again.
- The condition on `n` remains unchanged as it already satisfies the criteria of being greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is at least 4, `j` is 3**
