You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Annotated Functions:
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) representing the number of cakes, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r_i, h_i) such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10000 for each cake i.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` contains the maximum volume obtainable considering all valid previous cakes for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake. If no valid previous cakes exist for any `i` such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, `dp[i]` will equal `volumes[i]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which contains the maximum volume obtainable for each cake based on the volumes of previous cakes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the maximum possible volume obtainable from a selection of cakes, based on their individual volumes and the volumes of cakes that can be stacked on top of each other. It accepts a positive integer `n` that denotes the number of cakes and a list of tuples `cakes`, each containing two integers representing the radius and height of each cake. The function computes the volume for each cake, storing these values, and then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum cumulative volume by considering stacking cakes whose volumes are in increasing order. The final output is the maximum volume that can be achieved from all valid stacking combinations of the cakes provided. The implementation does not account for the scenario where no cakes are present (i.e., when `n` is 0), which would typically result in an output of 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r_i, h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, with 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples representing cakes, where each tuple contains the radius and height of each cake. It generates the list of cakes from the input, then calls another function `func_1` with `n` and the created list of cakes. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_1`, formatted to six decimal places. However, the provided code does not include error handling for invalid input formats or values outside the specified constraints, which could lead to runtime errors. The function is not designed to validate input data or handle edge cases where input might not meet the expected criteria.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
