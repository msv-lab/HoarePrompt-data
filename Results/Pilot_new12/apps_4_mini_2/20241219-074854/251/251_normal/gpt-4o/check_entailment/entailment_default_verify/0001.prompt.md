You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import sys
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we can break down the problem and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: We are given `n` cakes with their respective radii and heights.
2. **Volume Calculation**: The volume of each cake is computed using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: \( V = \pi r^2 h \).
3. **Placement Logic**: A cake can be placed on top of another only if:
   - The volume of the upper cake is strictly greater than the volume of the lower cake.
   
4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum total volume possible by iterating through each cake and checking if it can be placed on previous cakes based on the volume restrictions.

### Given Code Analysis:
- The function `func_1()` computes the volumes of the cakes, initializes a `dp` array where each index holds the maximum volume obtainable using that cake, and iteratively determines if a cake can be placed on top of previously considered cakes.
  
- The function `func_2()` reads input data, processes it into a list of cakes, and calls `func_1()` to get the result.

### Potential Issues to Consider:
To verify correctness, we need to ensure:
1. Each cake is compared accurately according to the volume condition.
2. The maximum volume calculation covers all valid stacking configurations.
3. Ensure the logic adheres to the description and edge cases are considered.

### Edge Case Testing:
Let's consider an edge case where there are duplicates or cakes that can't potentially stack due to their sizes.

**Example Case**:
Input:
```
3
4 1
4 2
4 3
```
In this case, all cakes have the same radius, thus they all yield the same volume:
- Volume for each cake = π * 4² * height => π * 16 * height = 16π.

Volumes are:
- Cake 1: 16π
- Cake 2: 32π
- Cake 3: 48π

None can be stacked upon each other since all volumes are same. The expected maximum volume should be the single largest cake, which is 48π.

When running this through the given program, it incorrectly allows combinations that should not be valid because all volumes are equal. The requirement states "strictly greater," so there’s a flaw in accounting for cases where all volumes are the same.

### Conclusion:
Given that there is a counterexample where the program fails to respect the restriction of "strictly greater" in the volume stacking logic, the program does not handle this aspect correctly.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples representing cakes, where each tuple contains the radius and height of each cake. It generates the list of cakes from the input, then calls another function `func_1` with `n` and the created list of cakes. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_1`, formatted to six decimal places. However, the provided code does not include error handling for invalid input formats or values outside the specified constraints, which could lead to runtime errors. The function is not designed to validate input data or handle edge cases where input might not meet the expected criteria.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
