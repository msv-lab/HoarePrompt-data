You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import sys
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program has a logical flaw in handling the ordering of the cakes based on their volumes. The current implementation checks every pair of cakes, and it seems to incorrectly calculate and return maximum volumes regardless of the appropriate stacking rules as defined in the problem description.

Here's a potential problematic case:

Given input:
```
3
2 2
1 1
3 1
```

The corresponding volumes would be:
- Cake 1: Volume = π * 2^2 * 2 = 8π
- Cake 2: Volume = π * 1^2 * 1 = π
- Cake 3: Volume = π * 3^2 * 1 = 9π

According to the stacking conditions:
- Cake 1 (8π) can stack on the table, and Cake 3 (9π) can also stack on the table.
- But, Cake 2 (π) can stack on Cake 1 but not on Cake 3 because 8π > π is satisfied. 

The program's logic regarding stacking constraints does not seem to properly ensure that only cakes with strictly lesser volumes can support the higher cakes for maximum stacking of volumes, potentially leading to incorrect results. 

In the current implementation, it doesn't correctly ensure that you can only place cake i on top of cake j if the volume of cake i is greater than cake j, leading to incorrect volume summation in certain configurations.

Hence, this issue leads to at least one case where the program does not meet the expectations set out in the problem description, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) representing the number of cakes, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r_i, h_i) such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10000 for each cake i.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` contains the maximum volume obtainable considering all valid previous cakes for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake. If no valid previous cakes exist for any `i` such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, `dp[i]` will equal `volumes[i]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which contains the maximum volume obtainable for each cake based on the volumes of previous cakes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the maximum possible volume obtainable from a selection of cakes, based on their individual volumes and the volumes of cakes that can be stacked on top of each other. It accepts a positive integer `n` that denotes the number of cakes and a list of tuples `cakes`, each containing two integers representing the radius and height of each cake. The function computes the volume for each cake, storing these values, and then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum cumulative volume by considering stacking cakes whose volumes are in increasing order. The final output is the maximum volume that can be achieved from all valid stacking combinations of the cakes provided. The implementation does not account for the scenario where no cakes are present (i.e., when `n` is 0), which would typically result in an output of 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r_i, h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, with 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples representing cakes, where each tuple contains the radius and height of each cake. It generates the list of cakes from the input, then calls another function `func_1` with `n` and the created list of cakes. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_1`, formatted to six decimal places. However, the provided code does not include error handling for invalid input formats or values outside the specified constraints, which could lead to runtime errors. The function is not designed to validate input data or handle edge cases where input might not meet the expected criteria.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
