Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` contains the maximum volume obtainable considering all valid previous cakes for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake. If no valid previous cakes exist for any `i` such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, `dp[i]` will equal `volumes[i]`.**
