The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of cakes, and `cakes`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers, `r_i` and `h_i`, representing the radius and height of each cake, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum value from the list `dp`, which contains the maximum volume obtainable for each cake based on the volumes of previous cakes. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, and return the maximum volume obtainable from the given cakes. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n representing the number of cakes and a list of tuples cakes containing the radius and height of each cake. It returns the maximum volume obtainable from the given cakes.**
