According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the current value of `j` and the upper limit defined by `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `i - 1`, so it will execute again for `j` equal to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we had the condition that `1 ≤ i < n`, which guarantees that `i` is at least `2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be updated to `i` (since after the last iteration, `j` would be `i - 1`), and for the next execution, `j` must be equal to `i`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), `i` is such that `1 ≤ i < n`, and `j` must be equal to `i`**.
