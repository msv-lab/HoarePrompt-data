Postcondition: ***`volumes` is a list of volumes, `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), `i` is at least 2 and less than len(volumes), `j` is at least 2 and less than `i`, and after incrementing `j` by 1, if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.***
