Functionality: **The function calculates the maximum possible volume obtainable from a selection of cakes, based on their individual volumes and the volumes of cakes that can be stacked on top of each other. It accepts a positive integer `n` that denotes the number of cakes and a list of tuples `cakes`, each containing two integers representing the radius and height of each cake. The function computes the volume for each cake, storing these values, and then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum cumulative volume by considering stacking cakes whose volumes are in increasing order. The final output is the maximum volume that can be achieved from all valid stacking combinations of the cakes provided. The implementation does not account for the scenario where no cakes are present (i.e., when `n` is 0), which would typically result in an output of 0.**
