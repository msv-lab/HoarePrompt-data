According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `i-1`, which means it will execute again if `j` (the loop variable) is less than `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`, indicating that this is the first iteration of the loop. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be increased by `1`, making `j` equal to `1`.

The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must still be less than `i`. Given that `i` is greater than `0`, `j` can be `1` if `i` is at least `2`.

Thus, to summarize:
- `j` will be incremented to `1`.
- `i` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
