Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), for `i` such that `1 ≤ i < n`, if `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. `dp[j]` remains unchanged corresponding to a valid index `j`, and `j` is such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`.***
