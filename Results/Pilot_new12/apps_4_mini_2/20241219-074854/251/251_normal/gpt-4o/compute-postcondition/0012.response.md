The assignment `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])` updates the value of `dp[i]`. The specific value of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]` are not defined in the initial state. However, we know the relationships of the variables:

- `n` is a positive integer in the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), meaning `i` can be any integer greater than 2 and up to `n`.
- `j` is 2.

Therefore, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` (which is `dp[2]`) plus `volumes[i]`.

Since we do not have specific values for `dp[i]`, `dp[2]`, or `volumes[i]`, we indicate that the output state reflects the maximum being calculated, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `dp[i]` is updated to max(`dp[i]`, `dp[2] + volumes[i]`)**
