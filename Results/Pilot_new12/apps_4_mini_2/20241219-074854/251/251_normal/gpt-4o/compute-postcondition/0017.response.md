To analyze the provided code and determine the necessary state adjustments for the for loop to execute, we need to consider the loop statement `for j in range(i):`.

1. The loop will iterate over values of `j` starting from 0 up to `i-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0.
2. The state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, ranging from 2 to 100001, and that `dp[i]` equals `volumes[i]` for each valid index `i`.
3. However, we don't have any contextual information regarding the variable `i` in the initial state. To ensure that the loop can execute, `i` must be defined and greater than 0.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure:

- `i` must be greater than or equal to 1. 
- The variable `j` will start from 0 during the first iteration.

So we adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]` for each valid index `i`, `i` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
