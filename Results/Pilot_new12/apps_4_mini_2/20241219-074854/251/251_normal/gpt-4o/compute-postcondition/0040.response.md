Output State: **`volumes` is a list of volumes, `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), `i` is at least 2 and less than len(volumes), `dp[i]` contains the maximum possible value calculated by adding `volumes[i]` to any `dp[j]` where `j` is less than `i` and `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`. If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains as its initial value, which is equal to `volumes[i]`.**
