The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `data` will hold this list of strings.

However, the variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the execution of this code. The contents of `cakes` are also not affected.

The output state reflects that `data` now holds the list of strings input from the user, while `n` and `cakes` remain in their original state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `cakes` is a list of tuples (r_i, h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake; `data` is a list of strings from input.**
