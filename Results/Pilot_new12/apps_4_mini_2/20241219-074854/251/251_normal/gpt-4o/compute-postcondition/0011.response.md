According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to `i`. The loop will execute for `j` values starting from 0 up to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 2 for the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `i`, which means `i` must be greater than 2 since `j` is becoming 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `i` is greater than 2, `j` is 2.**
