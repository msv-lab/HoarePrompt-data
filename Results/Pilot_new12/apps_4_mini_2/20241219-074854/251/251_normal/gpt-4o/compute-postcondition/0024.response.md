According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i`. In this case, `j` is initialized to `i` and iterates from 0 to `i-1` (since `range(i)` means it will run for `j` values of `0` to `i-1`). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is such that `1 ≤ i < n`, and `j` is equal to `i`, meaning the last value of `j` during the previous iteration must have been `i - 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented, starting from `0` to `i-1`. After the last iteration of the loop where `j` would have been `i-1`, the next value of `j` should be `i`, and the loop would then terminate since `range(i)` does not include `i`.

So for one additional iteration, we increment `j` to `i` and note that the range condition is still satisfied.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), `i` is such that `1 ≤ i < n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `if volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i] + volumes[i]`.**
