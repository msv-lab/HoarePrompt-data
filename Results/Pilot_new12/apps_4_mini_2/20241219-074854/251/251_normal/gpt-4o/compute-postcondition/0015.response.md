According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` compared to `n`. The loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the index `i` would have reached its current value, which is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, it will attempt to evaluate `i` as `n`, which means the loop will not execute again since `i` must be less than `n`.

Consequently, we need to ensure that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be adjusted so that it reflects a requirement allowing `i` to be less than `n` during the next check. Thus, `n` should be at least `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), `dp` remains a list where each `dp[i]` contains the maximum volume obtainable considering all valid previous cakes for each `i`, and `dp[0]` is equal to `volumes[0]`**.
