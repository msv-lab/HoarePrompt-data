Postcondition: ***`volumes` is a list of volumes, `n` remains a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), `i` is at least 1 and less than len(volumes), and `dp[i]` is updated to be equal to `volumes[j] + volumes[i]` if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`. If `volumes[j]` is not less than `volumes[i]`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged with its previous value of `volumes[i]`.***
