The code assigns `dp[i]` the value of `volumes[i]`. Since each `dp[i]` is now directly equal to the corresponding `volumes[i]`, the output state reflects this assignment. The state of `n` and the previous values of the `dp` list entries are preserved, but `dp[i]` is updated to the value from `volumes[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]` for each valid index `i`.**
