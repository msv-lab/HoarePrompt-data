The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100,000 \).
- `cakes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers \( (r_i, h_i) \) representing the radius and height of the \( i \)-th cake, with \( 1 \leq r_i, h_i \leq 10,000 \). 

The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the conditions outlined in the constraints. However, the specific behavior and output of the function were not detailed in the provided information, so that aspect cannot be described.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of tuples cakes, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of cakes.**
