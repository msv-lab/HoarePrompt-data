Postcondition: ***`volumes` is a list of volumes, `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), and `i` is at least 2 and less than len(volumes). If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and the sum of `dp[j]` and `volumes[i]` for each `j` in the range(0, i).***
