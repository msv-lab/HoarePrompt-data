Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100001), `i` is such that `1 ≤ i < n`, `j` is equal to `i`. If `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i] + volumes[i]`. If the condition `volumes[j] < volumes[i]` is not met, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
