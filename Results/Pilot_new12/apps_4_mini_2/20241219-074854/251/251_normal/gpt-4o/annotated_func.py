#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) representing the number of cakes, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r_i, h_i) such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10000 for each cake i.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` contains the maximum volume obtainable considering all valid previous cakes for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `volumes` is a list of calculated volumes for each cake. If no valid previous cakes exist for any `i` such that `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, `dp[i]` will equal `volumes[i]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list 'dp', which contains the maximum volume obtainable for each cake based on the volumes of previous cakes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the maximum possible volume obtainable from a selection of cakes, based on their individual volumes and the volumes of cakes that can be stacked on top of each other. It accepts a positive integer `n` that denotes the number of cakes and a list of tuples `cakes`, each containing two integers representing the radius and height of each cake. The function computes the volume for each cake, storing these values, and then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum cumulative volume by considering stacking cakes whose volumes are in increasing order. The final output is the maximum volume that can be achieved from all valid stacking combinations of the cakes provided. The implementation does not account for the scenario where no cakes are present (i.e., when `n` is 0), which would typically result in an output of 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (r_i, h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, with 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples representing cakes, where each tuple contains the radius and height of each cake. It generates the list of cakes from the input, then calls another function `func_1` with `n` and the created list of cakes. Finally, it prints the result returned by `func_1`, formatted to six decimal places. However, the provided code does not include error handling for invalid input formats or values outside the specified constraints, which could lead to runtime errors. The function is not designed to validate input data or handle edge cases where input might not meet the expected criteria.
