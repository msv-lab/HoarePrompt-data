Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

Specifically, let's analyze its behavior when `n` is not a power of 10. For instance, consider the input `n = 7`:

- According to the problem description, we can find pairs that result in total costs ending with the maximum number of nines. For `n = 7`, there are three valid pairs: (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5), which all add to a sum ending with a single nine.
  
- However, the current implementation will enter the `while` loop as `n + 1` is not divisible by 10 and will not increment `max_9s`, leading to `max_9s` being zero and incorrectly calculating the number of pairs as `(7 + 1) * 0`, which results in 0, not 3 as per expected behavior.

This indicates that the logic for handling the maximum number of nines in sums of shovel costs is incorrect. The program lacks the correct handling of combinations that sum up to a value ending with 9 or more nines unobstructed by `10`. 

Thus, there's a clear failure in the implementation for certain inputs. For `n = 7`, the program should output `3`, but instead, it outputs `0`. Hence, it does not satisfy the requirements.
