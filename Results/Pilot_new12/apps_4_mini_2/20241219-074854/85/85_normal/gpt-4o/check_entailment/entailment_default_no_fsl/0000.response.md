Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not accurately handle the problem's requirements regarding counting pairs of shovels whose costs sum to a value that ends with the maximum number of trailing nines. 

The provided output hints indicate that if the input number `n` has no trailing nines, the function will output `0`, which is incorrect for the scenarios specified in the problem description. For example:

- If `n = 7`, the expected output should be `3`, as the pairs (2,7), (3,6), and (4,5) yield sums that end with exactly one nine.
- If `n = 14`, the expected output should be `9`, drawing from the pairs suggested in the examples.

The logic implemented in the `func()` for counting trailing nines is not appropriately aligned with evaluating and counting all valid pairs that fulfill the requirement of maximizing the trailing nines in their sum.

Additionally, the while loop that checks for `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` would fail to handle many valid scenarios, as the concept of "trailing nines" does not correspond directly to checking if the adjusted number is divisible by ten. Therefore, the function does not account correctly for the problem's scenario of maximizing trailing nines, leading to incorrect outputs for many valid inputs.
