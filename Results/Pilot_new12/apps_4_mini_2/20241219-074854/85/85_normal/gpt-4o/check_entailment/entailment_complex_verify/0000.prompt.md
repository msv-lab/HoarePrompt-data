You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        n //= 10
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to carefully evaluate the logic implemented in the program and check whether it meets the requirements outlined.

### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to find the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. Given an integer `n`, which represents the highest cost of a shovel, we need to achieve this by pairing up the shovels and analyzing their combined cost.

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        n //= 10
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)
```

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Finding Maximum Nines**:
   - The `while` loop checks how many trailing zeros there are in `(n + 1)`. This works fine for detecting how many times `(n + 1)` can be divided by `10` before it is no longer divisible, which indicates how many trailing nines can be achieved by summing shovel costs that pair up accordingly.
   - The variable `max_9s` is incremented for every time the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` holds true, representing each additional trailing nine.
  
2. **Calculating Pairs**:
   - The formula `(n + 1) * max_9s` is meant to calculate the number of valid pairs but might be incorrect depending on how `max_9s` is evaluated, especially for edge cases where the sum may produce different pairings.

### Potential Issues
To verify if the program handles all cases correctly:
- When `n` is small (e.g., `n=2`), the output should be `0` since no pairs can be formed that yield trailing nines.
- For cases where `n` results in sums lesser than `9`, the logic might fail to count possible pairs adequately.

#### For Example
**Test case `n = 1`:**
- The expected output should be `0` since we cannot have any pairs when there is only one shovel. However, the code would not fully account for the lower boundary and might give a count based on `max_9s`.

**Test case `n = 3`:**
- The pairs possible are `(1,3)` and `(2,2)`, hence the expected output is `1` (for pair `(1, 3)`), but `max_9s` logic might still not yield accurate pair evaluations depending on the pairing.

### Conclusion
Given these observations and potential issues with the logic, the program does not produce correct outputs for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement. 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `max_9s` is equal to the number of trailing 9's in the original input integer `n`
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input `n` from the user, counts the number of trailing 9's in its decimal representation, and then calculates and prints the product of the number of trailing 9's and the value of `n + 1` after removing those 9's. The function does not accept any parameters directly, and if `n` has no trailing 9's, the output will be `0`, as the count `max_9s` will remain `0`. Additionally, there's a potential edge case where if the input number is less than 10 (greater than 2), it will yield an output of `1`, as the loop will not execute, and `pairs` will be calculated as `1 * 0`. Overall, the function effectively transforms the input based on its trailing digits and presents a computed value based on them.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
