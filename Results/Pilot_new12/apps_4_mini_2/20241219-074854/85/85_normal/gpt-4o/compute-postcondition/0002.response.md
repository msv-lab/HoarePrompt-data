According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This condition is true when `n + 1` is a multiple of 10. 

Given that `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, we can see that to fulfill the condition for the first execution of the loop, `n + 1` must equal 10, 20, 30, etc. In essence, `n` must be of the form 9, 19, 29, ... , or more generally, `n + 1` should end with a 0.

For the current state, since `max_9s` does not influence the loop condition, we only need to adjust `n`. Since `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^9, we need to ensure `n` is adjusted to one of the values that satisfy the condition `n + 1` is a multiple of 10.

Therefore, the minimum adjustment needed right now is for `n` to be changed to 9, which ensures that `n + 1` equals 10, allowing the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 0**
