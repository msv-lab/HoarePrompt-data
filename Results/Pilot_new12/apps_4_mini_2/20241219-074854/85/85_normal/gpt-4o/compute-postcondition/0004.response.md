The operation `n //= 10` performs an integer division of `n` by `10` and assigns the result back to `n`. The initial value of `n` is `9`, so after executing this operation, `n` is updated to `0` because `9 // 10` evaluates to `0`. The other variable `max_9s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0; `max_9s` is 1**
