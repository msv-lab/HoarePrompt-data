The value of `n` is adjusted by performing an integer floor division by 10. The initial value of `n` is 9, so this operation results in `n` becoming 0. The variable `max_9s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now 0, and `max_9s` is still 2. 

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is 2**
