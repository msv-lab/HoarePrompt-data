Functionality: **The function reads an integer input `n` from the user, counts the number of trailing 9's in its decimal representation, and then calculates and prints the product of the number of trailing 9's and the value of `n + 1` after removing those 9's. The function does not accept any parameters directly, and if `n` has no trailing 9's, the output will be `0`, as the count `max_9s` will remain `0`. Additionally, there's a potential edge case where if the input number is less than 10 (greater than 2), it will yield an output of `1`, as the loop will not execute, and `pairs` will be calculated as `1 * 0`. Overall, the function effectively transforms the input based on its trailing digits and presents a computed value based on them.**
