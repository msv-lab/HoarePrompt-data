The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the constraints, `n` is an integer that satisfies `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. However, since the function does not take `n` as an argument in its definition, it implies that `n` would be determined or provided outside the function, potentially as a global variable or through some other means.

The output of the function is not explicitly described in the provided information, but since `n` is specified as being between 2 and 10^9, the functionality would likely involve processing or returning a value based on this particular integer.

Therefore, as the function's parameter is implicit and not directly passed to it, we cannot specify its behavior solely based on the given information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly and its output depends on the external handling of the variable n, which is an integer constrained between 2 and 10^9. The exact output is not specified.**
