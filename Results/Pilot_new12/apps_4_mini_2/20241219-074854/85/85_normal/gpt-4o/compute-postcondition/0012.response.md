The variable `pairs` is assigned the value calculated as `(n + 1) * max_9s`. Since `n` is 0, the expression simplifies to `pairs = (0 + 1) * max_9s`, which results in `pairs = 1 * max_9s`, or simply `pairs = max_9s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0, `max_9s` is equal to the number of trailing 9's in the original input integer `n`, and `pairs` is equal to `max_9s`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is equal to the number of trailing 9's in the original input integer `n`, `pairs` is equal to `max_9s`.**
