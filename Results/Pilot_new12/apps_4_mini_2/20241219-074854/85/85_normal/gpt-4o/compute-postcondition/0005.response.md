According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `(n + 1) % 10` must equal 0, which means `n + 1` has to be a multiple of 10. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, so `n + 1` is 1, which is not a multiple of 10. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `n + 1` must equal 10, where `n` must therefore be adjusted to 9. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be adjusted to 9, `max_9s` is 1**
