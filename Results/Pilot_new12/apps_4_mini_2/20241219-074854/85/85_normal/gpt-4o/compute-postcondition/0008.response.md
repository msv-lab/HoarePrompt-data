According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. For this condition to hold true and for the loop to execute again, `n + 1` must be a multiple of 10. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0. Therefore, `n + 1` equals 1. Since 1 is not a multiple of 10, the loop cannot execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `n + 1` must be 10 or another multiple of 10. This means `n` must be increased to 9. 

Thus, the required adjustment is to set `n` to 9, while `max_9s` does not need to be changed. 

State: **`n` must be 9, `max_9s` is 2**
