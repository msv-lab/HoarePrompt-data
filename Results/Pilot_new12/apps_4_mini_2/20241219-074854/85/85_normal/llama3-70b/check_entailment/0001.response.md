Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. The program attempts to check if the total cost of the pair of shovels (i + (n - i)) ends with a certain number of nines, which is supposed to maximize the number of nines at the end. However, the condition used in the if statement:
   ```python
   if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
   ```
   is incorrect for determining if the sum ends with a specific number of nines. This logic will not account for the actual number of trailing nines in the sum.

2. For instance, if we take `n = 50`, the pairs must sum to 99 (which indeed ends with two nines). However, the program may not output the correct pairs that yield this result. It only checks whether the last digit is zero for a calculated expression, rather than counting how many trailing nines there are.

3. If we analyze the output from the stated examples:
   - For `n = 7`, it needs to output `3` pairs, but the logic does not confirm that it finds the right pairs.
   - For `n = 14`, it should output `9`, but due to the flawed logic above, it might return a lesser count.
   - For `n = 50`, it should output `1`, but it is unclear if the implementation correctly identifies the pairs.

The logic needed involves explicitly determining how many pairs of sums can achieve those maximum nines rather than just checking each sum's last digits. 

Thus, I conclude that the program as it stands does not meet the problem requirements effectively.

In summary, since the program contains flawed logic that does not guarantee finding pairs that achieve the maximum number of nines consistently, it leads to an outcome of correctness being `False`.
