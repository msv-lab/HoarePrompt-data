The function reads an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and calculates the count of integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n // 2` inclusive for which the sum `(i + (n - i))`, which simplifies to `n`, is a multiple of `10` raised to the power of `(len(str(n)) - 1)`. It prints out this count (`ans`). The function does not return a value; it only outputs the result. It lacks input validation for edge cases, such as handling invalid or non-integer inputs and does not address the scenario when `n` is outside the specified bounds. The output will be `0` if no valid `i` values meet the condition, or a positive integer denoting the count of such `i` values.
