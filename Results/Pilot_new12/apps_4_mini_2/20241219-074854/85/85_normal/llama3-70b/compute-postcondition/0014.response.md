The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, it will produce an output based on this input parameter. However, no explicit output or return value is provided in the description for the given function. Therefore, without additional details on the output, we cannot specify the exact functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is an integer within the range of 2 to 10^9. The specific return value or output is not defined.**
