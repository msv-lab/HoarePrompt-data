`ans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `ans` is unknown. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Thus, we know that `n` remains as an integer within the range [4, 10^9], `i` is still 2, and `ans` is at least 1 greater than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1**
