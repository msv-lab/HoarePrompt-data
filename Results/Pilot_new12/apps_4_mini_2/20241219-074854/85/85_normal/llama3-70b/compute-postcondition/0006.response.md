According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop is set to run for `i` values from 1 to `n // 2`, inclusive. Given that `i` is currently at 1, the loop will execute again as long as `n // 2` is greater than or equal to 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will become 2. Additionally, `n` needs to be at least 4 for `n // 2` to be at least 2.

Therefore, the adjusted conditions for the next iteration are: `i` will be 2, and `n` must be such that it is greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2**
