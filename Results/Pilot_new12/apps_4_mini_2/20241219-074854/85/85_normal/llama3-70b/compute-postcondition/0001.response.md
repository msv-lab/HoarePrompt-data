The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The value of `n` is unchanged in relation to its range, as it is equal to an input integer that respects the constraints given (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). Therefore, the only change from the initial state is that `ans` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `ans` is 0**
