According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The range for `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n // 2`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2, as `n // 2 + 1` should be greater than 1. Given that the condition for `n` is already satisfied (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), the state of `n` is appropriate for execution.

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `ans` is 0, but this does not affect whether the loop runs. The loop variable `i` will start at 1 for the first iteration. 

So the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` is 1 initially.
- `n` must be at least 2, which it already is.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
