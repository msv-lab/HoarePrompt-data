Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is a value greater than or equal to 289 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, `i` becomes greater than the square root of `x` such that `i` is now some value greater than 11, and if no divisors were found in the iterations, the program would return True.**
