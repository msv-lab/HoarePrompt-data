The value of `i` is incremented by 6. Given that the previous value of `i` is 11, the new value of `i` will be 17. The other variables (`n` and `x`) remain unchanged. The Output State must include the updated value of `i` and maintain information about the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is a value greater than or equal to 25, greater than 3, not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, `i` is now 17, and `x` is greater than or equal to 121. If `x` is divisible by `i` (17) or `i + 2` (19), the program returns False.**
