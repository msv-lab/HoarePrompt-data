To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `i * i <= x`. 

Currently, we have:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 (but it does not impact the loop execution)
- `x` is a value greater than 3 and is not divisible by 2 or 3
- `i` is currently 5

Now, we calculate `i * i`:
- `i * i = 5 * 5 = 25`

Next, we consider under what conditions the loop will execute. The loop executes as long as `i * i` (which is 25) is less than or equal to `x`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need the following condition to hold:
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 25. Since it is already given that `x` is a value greater than 3, we only need to ensure that `x` satisfies `x >= 25`.

Since `x` is a value greater than 3 and we did not set any specific constraints on it except for being >= 25—this should be stated explicitly:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is a value greater than or equal to 25 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, and `i` is 5**
