Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than or equal to 289, `x` is a value greater than or equal to 25, greater than 3, not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3. If `x` is divisible by `i` (17) or `i + 2` (19), the program returns False. Otherwise, there is no return value.***
