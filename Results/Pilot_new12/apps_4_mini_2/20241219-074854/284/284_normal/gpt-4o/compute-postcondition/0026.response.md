Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` (where 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000) and checks if it is a prime number. It returns False if `x` is less than or equal to 1, if `x` is 2 or 3 it returns True, and if `x` is divisible by either 2 or 3 it returns False. For numbers greater than 3 that are not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks for factors starting from 5 up to the square root of `x`, only considering values that are 6 units apart (5, 7, 11, etc.). If it finds any divisors in this range, it returns False. If no divisors are found, it returns True. This function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to runtime errors, and the case of `x` being equal to 1 is treated as non-prime by returning False immediately. Overall, the function effectively determines the primality of the positive integer `x`.**
