The value of `i` is incremented by 6. Previously, `i` was 5, so after the operation, `i` becomes 11. The values of `n`, `x`, and any other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is a value greater than or equal to 25 and greater than 3, `x` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, `i` is 11, and `x` is neither divisible by `5` nor `7`**.
