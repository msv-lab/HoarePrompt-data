The variable `i` is assigned the value 5. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is a value greater than 3, and `x` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3; `i` is 5.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is a value greater than 3, and `x` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3; `i` is 5**.
