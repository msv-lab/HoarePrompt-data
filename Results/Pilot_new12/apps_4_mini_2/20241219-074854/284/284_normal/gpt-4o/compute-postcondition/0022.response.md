The value of `i` is incremented by 6. Therefore, if `i` had an initial value, it is now `i + 6`. However, since the value of `i` is not explicitly stated in the initial conditions, we only know that it now increases by 6 but cannot determine its exact final value. The conditions on `n` and `x` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than or equal to 289, `x` is a value greater than or equal to 25, greater than 3, not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, and `i` is increased by 6.**
