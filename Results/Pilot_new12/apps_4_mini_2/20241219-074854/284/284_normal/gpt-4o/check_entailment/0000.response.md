To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether it accurately finds a value of `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number for any given `n`.

Upon reviewing the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

### Analysis of the code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`.
2. **Loop for m**: The program iterates `m` from 1 to 1000 and evaluates `n*m + 1`.
3. **Prime Checking**: The function `func_1` checks if `n*m + 1` is prime. If it is not prime, it prints `m` and breaks the loop.
4. **Prime Function Logic**: The logic within `func_1` is fairly comprehensive for checking primality for integers greater than 1.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- Consider the case where `n = 1`. The program will check `1*m + 1`, which produces sequential values of `2, 3, 4, 5, ...`.
    - In this scenario, `1 * 3 + 1 = 4`, which is not prime. Hence the output would be `3`. This case works correctly.
- Now consider `n = 4`:
    - For `m = 1`, `4 * 1 + 1 = 5` (prime)
    - For `m = 2`, `4 * 2 + 1 = 9` (not prime); the output would be `2`. This case works correctly too.
- Checking other values leads us to believe that the output would always yield a non-prime value for some `m` within the range due to the density of integers where `n*m + 1` can easily be composite.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing possible values of `n` and corresponding values of `m`, it is clear that the program will always find a suitable `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime. It efficiently loops through values without missing intervals because of the guaranteed existence of such `m`.

Correctness: **True**.
