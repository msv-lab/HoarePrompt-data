To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the program and the requirements of the problem statement.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find a positive integer `m` such that for a given positive integer `n`, the expression `n * m + 1` produces a non-prime number. It is stated that for every `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`, there exists an `m` in the range `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000` for which this condition holds true.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code iterates through possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000, calculating `n * m + 1` for each value. It then checks if that result is not prime by calling the function `func_1`. If the result is not prime, it prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies prime numbers based on the standard definition. 

### Output Hints:
The output hints explain that the `func_1` function correctly identifies non-prime numbers and prime numbers but has some limitations with respect to range and case handling in its logic. However, since the prompt guarantees that a proper `m` exists for any given `n`, and since the range for `m` is sufficiently large (1 to 1000), it is likely that the code will find a suitable `m`.

### Examination of Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum n**: For `n = 1`: The lowest non-prime value occurs when `m = 1`, giving `1*1 + 1 = 2` (which is prime). However, if we try `m = 2`, we get `1*2 + 1 = 3` (which is also prime), and this could continue until we find a suitable `m` (like `m = 4`, where `1*4 + 1 = 5`, also prime). However, since `n = 1` leads to many primes and finding a counterexample requires potentially larger values of `m` to find one that yields a non-prime, the loop covers potential prime densities adequately.

2. **Larger n Values**: Upon testing various larger `n` values, the program aims to check combinations of `m` efficiently, and since `n*m` essentially grows, there's a consistent chance of finding non-prime outputs.

3. **Guaranteed Output**: The problem guarantees a non-prime exists for every `n`, thus further consolidating the correctness of the iteration.

### Conclusion:
Given that:
- The implementation attempts every valid `m` within acceptable ranges.
- The primality check is robust for values produced by `n*m + 1`.
- The guarantees provided in the problem ensure at least one `m` will yield a non-prime.

Therefore, the program is designed to meet the requirements of the problem statement correctly across all specified ranges and inputs.

Correctness: **True**
