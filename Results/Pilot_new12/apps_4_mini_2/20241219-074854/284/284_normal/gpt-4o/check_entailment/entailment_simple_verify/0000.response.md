Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program accurately finds a value of `m` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number for any given `n`. The annotations provided further support this conclusion by affirmatively detailing the conditions under which `func_1` operates, including its coverage of prime checks. The program iterates through values of `m`, ensuring it evaluates all candidates from 1 to 1000, and the comprehensive nature of the prime-checking function makes it reliable for determining whether `n*m + 1` is prime. Since it is guaranteed that a counterexample exists for any provided `n` within the constraints, the program is verified to be correct.
