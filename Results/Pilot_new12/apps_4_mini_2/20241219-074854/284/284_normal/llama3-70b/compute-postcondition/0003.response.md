To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the `for` loop structure:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):`. This indicates the loop will iterate starting from `i = 2` up to `i = int(num ** 0.5)`.
2. Given that `num` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and specifically greater than or equal to 2, we note that the smallest value of `num` is 2.
3. Evaluating `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` for `num = 2`, we find `int(2 ** 0.5) + 1` equals `2`. Hence, the loop will not execute since `range(2, 2)` produces an empty range.
4. To ensure the loop executes, `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 2. This will happen when `num` is at least 4, since the square root of 4 is 2. Therefore, `num` must be adjusted to ensure it is greater than or equal to 4 to allow the loop to execute.

Thus, the adjusted state for the loop to run correctly is:
State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2**
