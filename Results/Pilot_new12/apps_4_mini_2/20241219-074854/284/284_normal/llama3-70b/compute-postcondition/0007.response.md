According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the expression `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than this upper limit. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `num` must be greater than or equal to 4, indicating that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 2. This means the upper limit for `i` is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` which is at least 3. 

To allow one more iteration of the loop, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3. Since `num` is an odd number and not divisible by 2, there are no constraints change for `num` based on `i`'s increment. 

State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3**
