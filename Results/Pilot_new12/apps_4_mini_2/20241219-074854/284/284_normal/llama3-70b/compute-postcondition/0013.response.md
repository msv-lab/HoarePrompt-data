Based on the provided code and the analysis of the loop:

1. The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, which means the maximum value of `i` will be the integer part of the square root of `num` plus one. 
2. The loop checks if `num` is divisible by `i`. If it finds any `i` for which `num % i == 0`, it returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not a prime number.
3. If the loop completes all iterations without finding a divisor, then `num` must be prime.

Considering the output states for the specified number of iterations:

- If `num` is even (i.e., greater than or equal to 4), the loop will find that `num` is divisible by `2` in the first iteration and return `False`.
- If `num` is odd and greater than or equal to 9, the loop could check additional values (3, 4...up to the integer part of the square root of `num`) to either return `False` or conclude that `num` is prime.

After analyzing the loop's execution:

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is such that if the loop completes all iterations without returning, then `num` is determined to be a prime number. If the loop finds a divisor, `num` is not prime, and the function returns `False`.**
