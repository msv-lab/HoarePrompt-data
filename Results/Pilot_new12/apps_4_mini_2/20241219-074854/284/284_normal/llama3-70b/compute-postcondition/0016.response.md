Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `num` such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\). It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if `num` is found to be divisible by any integer in the range from 2 to the square root of `num`. If no divisors are found in that range, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number. Note that the function does not handle cases where `num` is exactly equal to 1, which is not a prime number but falls within the specified input range. Additionally, if `num` is less than 2, the function will correctly return `False` without further checks.**
