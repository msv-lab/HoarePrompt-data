According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the variable `i` and the computed upper limit `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to run again, `i` must be less than the upper limit.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, but we donâ€™t know the exact value of `i`. Given that `i` starts at 2, the condition for the loop is that it will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. Therefore:

- If `i` was increased in the last iteration, it would now be at least 3.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`, so we should increment `i` by 1.

Assuming `i` was `k` before the next execution, the conditions would be:
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- Hence, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`.

Thus, `num` must satisfy that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least `k + 1`.

State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, and `int(num ** 0.5)` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`.**
