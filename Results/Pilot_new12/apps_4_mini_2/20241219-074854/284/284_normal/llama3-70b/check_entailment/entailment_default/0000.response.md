The provided program is tasked with finding a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis by determining a value `m` such that the expression `n * m + 1` is not a prime number.

1. The main loop iterates `m` from 1 to 1000, checking the value `n * m + 1`.
2. It uses the helper function `func_1` to determine if `n * m + 1` is a prime number. The function correctly identifies prime numbers, returning True for primes and False otherwise.
3. The loop stops and prints `m` as soon as it finds a value for which `n * m + 1` is not prime. 

The output hints clarify that the function `func_1` correctly identifies numbers less than 2 as non-prime, and appropriately checks for divisibility up to the square root of `num`.

However, the program does not explicitly handle the situation regarding `num` exactly equal to 1, which is treated as non-prime. The output hints mention this and imply that the function does not return True for this input, but rather returns False, which is appropriate for the context of identifying a counterexample.

While the code seems to cover the expected range of `m` values (1 to 1000) and handles all relevant cases correctly per the hypothesis, there is a notable concern with the operational integrity when assessing inputs close to 2. However, since 1 is indeed treated correctly and falls within the specification that an answer does exist, the code efficiently finds counterexamples as required.

Thus, after careful consideration, the program does meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.  

The function reliably finds a suitable `m` that produces a non-prime result for the expression `n * m + 1`, consistently adhering to the problem specifications.
