Correctness: **False**

The provided program is designed to find a positive integer `m` such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for a given `n`. However, there is a logical issue in the order of operations in the code.

Specifically, the function `func_1` is defined after its first call inside the loop. This would cause an error when the program runs because Python requires that functions be defined before they are called. 

Moreover, even if we assume the function was properly defined, one critical oversight is that for the input `m = 1`, the calculation yields \( n \cdot 1 + 1 = n + 1 \). If `n` is an even integer greater than 1 (like `n = 4`), then \( n + 1 \) will be odd and potentially prime, which means the first check could accidentally yield a prime instead of the required non-prime.

For instance:
- For \( n = 4 \), we would check \( 4 \cdot 1 + 1 = 5 \), which is prime.
- The program only relies on subsequent `m` values to find a non-prime, but if such an `m` is not found within the range (for any given even `n`, it might rely too heavily on values being odd), it won't properly find a counterexample.

Thus, both logical ordering and certain prime calculations create a valid counterexample where the program might not function as required. The program needs to ensure it properly generates and checks all values of `m`, and the logic (especially on the start index of `m`) should ensure it does not miss valid non-prime outputs.

In conclusion, due to improper function placement and potential non-prime outputs not being guaranteed across all valid `m` values, the correctness of the program is compromised.
