You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the program logic and identify potential issues or edge cases.

The program is designed to find a positive integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, where `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`. The function `func_1(num)` checks if a given number is prime, returning `False` for non-prime numbers.

1. The program starts by reading the value of `n`.
2. It then iterates over possible values of `m` from `1` to `1000`.
3. For each value of `m`, it calculates `num = n * m + 1` and checks if this number is non-prime using `func_1`.
4. If `num` is not prime, `m` is printed, and the loop breaks.

Now, let's analyze `func_1(num)`. This function appears to correctly implement the logic for checking if a number is prime by:
- Returning `False` if `num < 2`.
- Checking divisibility from `2` up to the square root of `num`.

However, we need to consider the following potential issues:

- The logic in the program loop relies on the assumption that there is always a valid `m` within the range which will satisfy the condition (`n * m + 1` is not a prime number). The problem states that it is guaranteed an answer exists, but this does not automatically ensure that the program correctly identifies it in all scenarios.
- If we consider specific values for `n`, such as `1` or values close to `1`, we should analyze how the first iterations work. For example, for `n = 1`, the output would rely solely on finding `m` such that `1 * m + 1` is not prime — specifically, we will get output `m = 1`, where `1 * 1 + 1 = 2`, a prime number; then we would need to check further values.

For `n = 1`, the results would be as follows:
- For `m = 1`: `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime)
- For `m = 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (prime)
- For `m = 3`: `1 * 3 + 1 = 4` (not prime)
- Here, `m = 3` is valid because `4` is not prime, but the initial iterations check until the first non-prime is found, potentially missing earlier non-prime results for later values of `m`.

After careful consideration, the program's logic correctly checks through the sequence of `m`, ensuring that it returns a result within constraints. However, the starting output of `m = 1` for certain values of `n` could yield results that might not capture the larger space, thus only somewhat correctly covers outputs.

After evaluating multiple scenarios, including the edge cases, it appears the program is accurate and works to identify values linear to `m`, thus satisfying the prompt's requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code performs as expected for the problem description and adheres to the requirement of finding non-prime results as guided by the function `func_1`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `num` such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\). It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if `num` is found to be divisible by any integer in the range from 2 to the square root of `num`. If no divisors are found in that range, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number. Note that the function does not handle cases where `num` is exactly equal to 1, which is not a prime number but falls within the specified input range. Additionally, if `num` is less than 2, the function will correctly return `False` without further checks.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
