After analyzing the provided information, including the problem description, the program code, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I arrived at the following conclusion regarding the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find a positive integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, for a given positive integer `n` in the range from 1 to 1000.

2. **Program Logic**: The program reads the integer `n`, iterates over possible values of `m`, computes `num = n * m + 1`, and checks if `num` is not a prime using `func_1`. If `num` is not prime, it prints `m` and stops further execution.

3. **Functionality of `func_1`**: This function correctly determines if `num` is prime. The annotated version confirms its behavior is as expected, covering both prime and non-prime cases appropriately.

4. **Edge Case of `num = 2`**: As noted, the function does not explicitly handle the case when `num` equals 1, which is not prime but still lies within the valid input range. However, since 1 cannot be produced as `n * m + 1` when both `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified limits, this point does not lead to incorrect results.

5. **Guaranteed Availability of Counterexamples**: The problem assures that there exists at least one valid `m` within specified constraints. The iterative approach looks through values from 1 to 1000 for `m`, which is adequate since it is guaranteed that a solution exists.

The original assessment accurately indicates that the program meets the requirements of the problem statement and efficiently identifies non-prime results. The state checks lined out in the annotations confirm that the function's logic is sound and that the program should successfully output a valid `m` for any valid `n`.

With all this considered, the program behaves correctly as designed and fulfills the objectives laid out in the problem description.

Final: **True**
