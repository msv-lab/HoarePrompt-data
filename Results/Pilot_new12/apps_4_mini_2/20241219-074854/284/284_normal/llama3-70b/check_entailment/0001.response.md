To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we first analyze the purpose of the program.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find a positive integer `m` such that the expression `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for a given positive integer `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`). According to the problem, a counterexample exists within the range `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000`.

### Code Review
The provided program is as follows:

```python
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

1. The code correctly reads an integer `n`.
2. It iterates through integers `m` from `1` to `1000`.
3. For each `m`, it computes `n * m + 1` and feeds that value to `func_1`, which checks if the number is prime.
4. If `func_1` returns `False` (indicating the number is not prime), `m` is printed, and the loop breaks.

### Potential Issues
However, let’s consider the implementation of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is designed to determine if a number is prime.
- It properly handles numbers less than 2, returning `False`.
- It checks divisibility from `2` to the square root of the number.

### Correctness Evaluation
The program is logically sound for the output requirements. The loop will always find an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number given that a counterexample is guaranteed to exist for every `n` in the specified range.

For example:
- If `n = 1`, then `m = 2` yields `n * m + 1 = 3`, which is prime, but `m = 3` yields `5`, also prime, but `m = 4` gives `9`, which is not prime.
- If `n = 2`, then `m = 3` gives `7`, prime, but `m = 4` produces `9`, which is not prime.

Since the logic properly iterates through possible values of `m` and correctly identifies a non-prime case based on the results of `func_1`, there is no scenario where the program would fail to provide a valid output within the constraints.

### Conclusion
Since the program effectively finds a counterexample for any integer `n`, and since it is guaranteed to find at least one valid `m` for the valid input range, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
