To determine the correctness of the given program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the program logic and identify potential issues or edge cases.

The program is designed to find a positive integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, where `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`. The function `func_1(num)` checks if a given number is prime, returning `False` for non-prime numbers.

1. The program starts by reading the value of `n`.
2. It then iterates over possible values of `m` from `1` to `1000`.
3. For each value of `m`, it calculates `num = n * m + 1` and checks if this number is non-prime using `func_1`.
4. If `num` is not prime, `m` is printed, and the loop breaks.

Now, let's analyze `func_1(num)`. This function appears to correctly implement the logic for checking if a number is prime by:
- Returning `False` if `num < 2`.
- Checking divisibility from `2` up to the square root of `num`.

However, we need to consider the following potential issues:

- The logic in the program loop relies on the assumption that there is always a valid `m` within the range which will satisfy the condition (`n * m + 1` is not a prime number). The problem states that it is guaranteed an answer exists, but this does not automatically ensure that the program correctly identifies it in all scenarios.
- If we consider specific values for `n`, such as `1` or values close to `1`, we should analyze how the first iterations work. For example, for `n = 1`, the output would rely solely on finding `m` such that `1 * m + 1` is not prime — specifically, we will get output `m = 1`, where `1 * 1 + 1 = 2`, a prime number; then we would need to check further values.

For `n = 1`, the results would be as follows:
- For `m = 1`: `1 * 1 + 1 = 2` (prime)
- For `m = 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 = 3` (prime)
- For `m = 3`: `1 * 3 + 1 = 4` (not prime)
- Here, `m = 3` is valid because `4` is not prime, but the initial iterations check until the first non-prime is found, potentially missing earlier non-prime results for later values of `m`.

After careful consideration, the program's logic correctly checks through the sequence of `m`, ensuring that it returns a result within constraints. However, the starting output of `m = 1` for certain values of `n` could yield results that might not capture the larger space, thus only somewhat correctly covers outputs.

After evaluating multiple scenarios, including the edge cases, it appears the program is accurate and works to identify values linear to `m`, thus satisfying the prompt's requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code performs as expected for the problem description and adheres to the requirement of finding non-prime results as guided by the function `func_1`.
