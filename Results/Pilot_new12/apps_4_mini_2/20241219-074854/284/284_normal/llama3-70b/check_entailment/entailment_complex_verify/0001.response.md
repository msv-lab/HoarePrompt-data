Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately concludes that the program meets the problem description of finding a counterexample for the PolandBall's hypothesis. The provided annotated version of the code further supports this conclusion, indicating that the function `func_1` correctly determines whether the expression `n * m + 1` is a prime number for positive integers `m` in the specified range. The logic of the program effectively ensures that it will find a valid `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, which is guaranteed to exist within the provided constraints. The annotations confirm that corner cases are handled appropriately and that the loop is structured correctly to find the required counterexample. Overall, the reasoning aligns with the program's behavior and the requirements of the problem description.
