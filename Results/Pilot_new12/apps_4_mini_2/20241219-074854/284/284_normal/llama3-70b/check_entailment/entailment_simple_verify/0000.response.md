After carefully reviewing the annotated version of the program in light of the original assessment and the problem description, it is clear that the original reasoning holds true. Here’s a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The program's goal is to find a positive integer `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for a given `n`. The problem guarantees that such an `m` exists within the specified range.

2. **Program Logic**: The program iterates over integers `m` from `1` to `1000`. For each `m`, it calculates `num = n * m + 1` and checks if this number is prime using the `func_1` function.

3. **Functionality of `func_1`**: The function correctly identifies whether a number is prime or not. The logic accounts for numbers less than `2`, and for numbers `≥ 2`, it checks for divisors correctly.

4. **Annotated Execution States**: The annotations detail the flow of execution comprehensively:
   - Before the call, `num` is a valid positive integer due to the constraints set by `m` and `n`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it correctly handles the base cases and the loop checks for primality accurately, ensuring all potential divisors up to the square root are considered.

5. **Program Coverage**: The approach taken by the program ensures that it will eventually find a non-prime output since the problem guarantees that such a case exists. Even if the program doesn’t find the smallest `m` in some edge cases, it will still terminate correctly upon finding any valid `m` that satisfies the condition.

Based on all the information considered, including the annotated states which support the logical flow of the algorithm, the original assessment aligns with the program's intended functionality. 

Final: **True**
