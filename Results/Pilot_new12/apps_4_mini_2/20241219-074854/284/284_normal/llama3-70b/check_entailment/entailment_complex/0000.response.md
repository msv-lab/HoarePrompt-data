Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to find a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for the given input \( n \). However, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where \( n \cdot m + 1 \) equals 1, which is not a prime number.

According to the problem description, it is guaranteed that for all inputs, there exists such an \( m \) that the expression will yield a non-prime number, including the possibility that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) could equal 1 (specifically when \( n = 1 \) and \( m = 1 \)). Since the implementation of `func_1` returns `False` for values that are less than 2, it effectively ignores this potential counterexample.

Additionally, the program's approach is missing logic to directly output \( m \) when the condition results in 1 (i.e., \( n \cdot 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is prime or \( n \cdot 1 + 1 = 1 \)). 

Therefore, the program fails to fulfill all conditions of the problem description properly, particularly the guarantee on existing counterexamples for each \( n \), leading to the conclusion that it does not correctly meet the requirement for "any suitable \( m \)". 

Thus, the program could output a situation where it incorrectly identifies a number as not being a prime when, in fact, it can also output a scenario that correctly identifies an \( m \). As a result, this proves the overall hypothesis wrong regarding the existence of a counterexample without accounting for cases where \( n \cdot m + 1 \) evaluates to a non-prime effectively.

Hence, the program does not adhere strictly to the problem requirements as defined.
