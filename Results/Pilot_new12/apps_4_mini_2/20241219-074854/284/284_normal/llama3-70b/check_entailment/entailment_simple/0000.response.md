Correctness: **True**

The program adheres to the problem description effectively. Here's the breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes an integer input `n`, which lies between 1 and 1000, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Loop to Find `m`**: It uses a loop that iterates over values of `m` from 1 to 1000. This ensures that all possible values of `m` within the required range are examined.

3. **Prime Checking**: The function `func_1` is used to check whether the expression `n * m + 1` is a prime number. According to the problem description, we need to find at least one value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number.

4. **Condition for Non-Prime**: If `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime, the program prints `m` and exits the loop. This directly serves the purpose of providing a counterexample to disprove the hypothesis stated in the problem description.

5. **Correctness of the Prime Check**: The prime-checking logic correctly handles cases for numbers less than 2 (always returning `False`) and accurately determines primality for all integers up to `1000` through trial division.

Hence, since the structure and logic of the program guarantee that it will successfully find an appropriate `m` for every input `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`), following the requirements laid out in the problem description, the program is indeed correct.
