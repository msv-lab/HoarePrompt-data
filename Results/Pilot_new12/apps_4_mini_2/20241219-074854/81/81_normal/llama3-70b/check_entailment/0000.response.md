The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` to calculate the GCD of two integers and `func_2` to calculate the LCM of two integers. However, the actual problem requires a way to find pairs of integers (a, b) such that their GCD and LCM match specified values x and y within the bounds l and r.

The program lacks the implementation of the logic to find all the good pairs (a, b) based on the GCD and LCM conditions and the given bounds. There are no functions that actually check for the conditions `l ≤ a, b ≤ r` and ensure that the pairs (a, b) correspond to the required GCD and LCM.

For instance, if we input:
- l = 1
- r = 2
- x = 1
- y = 2

While the GCD(1, 2) = 1 and LCM(1, 2) = 2 correctly matches, the program doesn't implement the logic to find and count such pairs or handle cases correctly. It will effectively return 0 pairs since no counting operation is defined.

Since the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description and does not include the necessary logic to find pairs, we can conclude that:

Correctness: **False**. 

A correct implementation would require iterating through possible values of a and b within the bounds l and r, checking if they yield GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, and counting such pairs.
