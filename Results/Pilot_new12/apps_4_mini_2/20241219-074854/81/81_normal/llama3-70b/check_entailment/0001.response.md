Correctness: **False**

The provided code only defines two functions: `func_1` for calculating the GCD of two numbers and `func_2` for calculating the LCM of two numbers. However, the program does not include any logic to determine the number of good pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions described in the problem (including the bounds for a and b). 

To illustrate a potential case where the program fails:
- Consider the input: `1 10 1 10`. There are valid pairs like (1, 10), (10, 1), (2, 5), (5, 2), etc., which must be counted. But since the main counting logic that utilizes these functions is missing, there is no way to derive the correct count of good pairs based on the inputs provided. 

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the task described in the problem statement and is marked incorrect.
