To analyze the final output state after the loop executes, we must consider how the values of `a` and `b` change through each iteration according to the Euclidean algorithm, which this loop implements.

Initial State: `a` and `b` are integers greater than 0.

The loop continues as long as `b` is greater than 0, performing the following operations:
- The value of `a` is updated to the current value of `b`.
- The value of `b` is updated to be the remainder of the division of the original `a` by the original `b`.

This operation continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates. Additionally, during the iterations:
- If `b` was originally greater than 0, then `b` will decrease as the loop progresses until it becomes 0.

Ultimately, when the loop finishes:
- The value of `a` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`.
- The value of `b` will be 0, which indicates that the loop has terminated.

Given these observations, we can define the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed:

Output State: **`b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`.**
