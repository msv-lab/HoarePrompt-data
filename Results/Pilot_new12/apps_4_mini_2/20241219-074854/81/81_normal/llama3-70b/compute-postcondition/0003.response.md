`a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `b` is defined as `a % b`, `b` will become the result of that operation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

After this operation, as `a` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `b` is derived from that, the updated preconditions will ensure that both `a` and `b` remain non-negative.

Output State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is `a % b`, with `a` being greater than or equal to 1, and both `a` and `b` greater than or equal to 0**.
