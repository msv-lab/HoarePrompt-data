The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers greater than 0. The function returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and 0, which is `a` itself. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and return the value of `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, and returns the value of a, which is the greatest common divisor of a and 0.**
