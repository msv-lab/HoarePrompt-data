#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers greater than 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of 'a' and 0, which is 'a' itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, a and b, and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The final state of the program after execution is such that the function returns the GCD of the original values of 'a' and 'b'. If 'b' is initially 0, the function will simply return 'a', since the GCD of a number and 0 is the number itself. It is important to note that the return postcondition incorrectly states that the function returns the GCD of 'a' and 0, as the function actually computes the GCD of both 'a' and 'b', and 'a' may not be the same as 'b'. Also, the annotations do not address cases where 'b' is initially 0, which would lead to immediate return of 'a'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 0 and b > 0.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the product of integers a and b divided by the result of func_1(a, b), where a and b are both greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both greater than 0. It calculates the product of `a` and `b` and divides this product by the result of a call to `func_1(a, b)`. The function ultimately returns this division result. However, it does not handle cases where `func_1(a, b)` returns 0, which would lead to a division by zero error, representing a significant edge case not addressed in the annotations or the code. Thus, the exact return value of the function also depends on the behavior of `func_1`.
