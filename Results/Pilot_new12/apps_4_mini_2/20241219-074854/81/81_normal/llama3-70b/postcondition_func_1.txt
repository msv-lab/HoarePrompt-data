The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both greater than 0. It calculates the product of `a` and `b` and divides this product by the result of a call to `func_1(a, b)`. The function ultimately returns this division result. However, it does not handle cases where `func_1(a, b)` returns 0, which would lead to a division by zero error, representing a significant edge case not addressed in the annotations or the code. Thus, the exact return value of the function also depends on the behavior of `func_1`.
