You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if y % x != 0:
        return 0
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y):
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
    return count


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and check for potential edge cases.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads four integers representing the bounds and the GCD/LCM requirements.

2. **Check GCD/LCM Condition**: The program first checks if `y` is divisible by `x`. This is crucial since if `GCD(a,b) = x`, then `LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/GCD(a,b)`, which implies that `y` must be a multiple of `x`. If this condition fails, it returns 0, which is correct behavior.

3. **Iterating Through Factors**: The program calculates the factor pairs `(a, b)` based on the quotient `z = y/x`. It iterates through all integers up to the square root of `z` to find valid `(a, b)` pairs where `l <= a, b <= r`.

4. **GCD and LCM Verification**: For each pair `a` and `b`, it checks:
    - Whether both `a` and `b` fall within the bounds `[l, r]`.
    - Whether `gcd(a, b) == x`.
    - Whether `lcm(a, b) == y`.

5. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The counting logic correctly considers the case where `a` and `b` might be equal, adjusting the count accordingly.

### Potential Test Cases:
To thoroughly assess the correctness, we should consider edge cases, particularly those at the limits of input constraints.

#### Edge Case Example:
1. **Case with Upper Bounds**:
   - Input: `1 1000000000 1 1000000000`
   - Expected Output: Should count the pairs `(1, 1000000000)` and `(1000000000, 1)` and others that meet the GCD and LCM conditions as long as they fall within the bounds.

2. **Non-Multiple Edge**:
   - Input: `10 20 3 8`
   - Here, `y` (8) is not divisible by `x` (3), which should return 0. Additionally, after confirming pairs in the bounds, we check if `a` and `b` calculated do not yield a correct GCD/LCM.

#### Finding the False Case:
Let's analyze if there's a case where the program could fail:
- Let `x = 2`, `y = 4`, with bounds `l = 1` and `r = 2`. The expected pairs satisfying the conditions exactly might be `(2, 4)` and `(4, 2)`, however, the bounds restrict `b` to be no greater than `2`. Thus we get no valid pairs.

#### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and ensuring all potential edge cases have been considered, I conclude that the program accurately implements the required functionality described in the prompt.

Thus, it meets all requirements, demonstrating correctness across various scenarios.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l, r, x, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if (y % x != 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9. The value of `y` is divisible by `x` (y % x = 0).
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and math.gcd(a, b
                ) == x and a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y:
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `count` are integers. `count` is equal to the total number of valid pairs (a, b) found such that a and b are within the range [l, r], gcd(a, b) equals x, and the product a * b / gcd(a, b) equals y. If there were no valid pairs found, count remains 0.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of valid pairs (a, b) found such that a and b are within the range [l, r], gcd(a, b) equals x, and the product a * b / gcd(a, b) equals y. If there were no valid pairs found, count remains 0.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
