You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(func_1(l, r, x, y))

def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if y % x != 0:
        return 0
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y):
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
    return count


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

1. In the `func_1` function, the first check `if y % x != 0:` ensures that for any good pair (a, b), `y` is a multiple of `x`. This is a necessary condition since the least common multiple (LCM) must be divisible by the greatest common divisor (GCD).

2. The variable `z` is calculated as `y // x`. The function then searches for divisors of `z`, since pairs (a, b) can be determined by the factors of `z` multiplied by `x`.

3. The for-loop iterates over all potential divisors of `z` up to its square root, which is correct for finding factor pairs.

4. Inside the loop:
   - The values of `a` and `b` are assigned as multiples of `x` based on the divisors.
   - It then checks if both `a` and `b` fall within the range `[l, r]`.
   - It also confirms that GCD(a, b) equals `x` and that the LCM calculation (using `a * b // GCD(a, b)`) equals `y`.
   - It counts pairs correctly, distinguishing between (a, b) and (b, a) when they are different.

Let's explore if there are potential cases where the program does not meet the problem's requirements:

### Example Case to Test
Consider:
- Input: `l = 1`, `r = 10`, `x = 1`, `y = 10`  
  Here, `y = 10` is a multiple of `x = 1`. The value of `z` becomes `10 // 1 = 10`.  
  The divisors of 10 are: (1, 10), (2, 5), (5, 2), (10, 1).
  
Let’s check the pairs of `(a, b)`:
- For divisor `1`:  
  - `a = 1 * 1 = 1`
  - `b = 10 // 1 * 1 = 10`  
  => (1, 10) and (10, 1) are within range.  
- For divisor `2`:  
  - `a = 2 * 1 = 2`  
  - `b = 10 // 2 * 1 = 5`  
  => (2, 5) and (5, 2) are also valid.  
- For `5`:  
  - `a = 5 * 1 = 5`  
  - `b = 10 // 5 * 1 = 2`  
  => Already counted as (2, 5).
- For `10`:  
  - `a = 10 * 1 = 10`  
  - `b = 10 // 10 * 1 = 1`  
  => Already counted as (1, 10).

Thus, we anticipate 6 found pairs (1,10), (10,1), (2,5), (5,2), (5,2), and (2,5) in total. However, the loop's implementation would count distinct pairs correctly and ensure one same pair (like (2,5) and (5,2) just once).

Upon verification:
- The function returns the correct counts and meets the described conditions of `GCD` and `LCM`.
- Edge cases also seem to be well handled, such as using the conditions of `l` and `r`.

Since we can't identify any violation of the problem's requirements, we conclude that the program functions correctly for all examined cases.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, with the constraints that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\). It checks if `y` is divisible by `x`. If not, the function returns `0`. If `y` is divisible by `x`, the function calculates `z` as \(y / x\) and iterates through possible divisors of `z` to find valid pairs `(a, b)`, where both are multiples of `x`, lie within the range \([l, r]\), have a greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x`, and satisfy the condition \(a * b / \text{gcd}(a, b) = y\). The function counts each valid pair and ensures duplicates are counted once if `a` equals `b`. Finally, it returns the count of these valid pairs. Edge cases include handling when either no valid pairs exist or when certain values of `x` or `y` result in restrictions on possible values for `a` and `b`. Overall, the function effectively identifies and counts pairs under specific mathematical properties and constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
