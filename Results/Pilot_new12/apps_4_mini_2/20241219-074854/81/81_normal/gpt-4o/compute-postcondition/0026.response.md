The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `a` is assigned the value of `i * x`. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so `i` will now be one greater than its prior value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is unchanged, and `a` is equal to `i * x`.**
