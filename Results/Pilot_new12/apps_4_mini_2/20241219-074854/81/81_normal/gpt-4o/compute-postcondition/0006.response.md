Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r`, `r` is an integer such that `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y`, `y` must be ≥ `x` to ensure `z` is at least 1, `z` is equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is initialized with 1, and the current value of `z` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `z % i == 0`)***
