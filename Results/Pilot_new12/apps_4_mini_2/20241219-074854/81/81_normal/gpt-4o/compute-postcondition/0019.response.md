The operation `b = z // i * x` assigns `b` the result of dividing `z` by `i`, then multiplying that quotient by `x`. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `count`, and `i` remain the same except for `i`, which has been incremented by 1 and must now be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(z))`. The value of `b` depends on the specific values of `z`, `i`, and `x`.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `count` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to int(sqrt(z)); `b` is equal to `z // i * x`.**
