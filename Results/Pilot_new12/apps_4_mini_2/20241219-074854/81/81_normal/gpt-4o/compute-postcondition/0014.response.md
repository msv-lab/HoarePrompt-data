Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer with \( 1 \leq l \leq r \); `r` is an integer with \( l \leq r \leq 10^9 \); `x` is an integer with \( 1 \leq x \leq y \); `y` is an integer with \( y \geq x \); `z` is equal to \( y // x \); if `a` is equal to `b`, then `count` is 1, `i` is 1, `a` is equal to `x`, and `b` is equal to \( (y // x) * x \); otherwise, `count` is 2, `i` is 1, `a` is equal to `x`, and `b` is equal to \( (y // x) * x \); in both cases, the current values of `a` and `b` lie between `l` and `r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`, and the product \( \frac{a * b}{\mathit{gcd}(a, b)} \) is equal to `y`.***
