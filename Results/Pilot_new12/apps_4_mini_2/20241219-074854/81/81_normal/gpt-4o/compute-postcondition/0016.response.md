Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `count`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `z % i == 0`, then if `a` is equal to `b`, `count` is set to 1, `i` is 1, `a` is equal to `x`, and `b` is equal to \( (y // x) * x \). Otherwise, `count` is set to 2, `i` is 1, `a` is equal to `x`, and `b` is equal to \( (y // x) * x \), while both `a` and `b` lie within the range of `l` and `r`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` remains equal to `x`, and the product \( \frac{a * b}{\mathit{gcd}(a, b)} \) is equal to `y`. If `z % i` is not 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
