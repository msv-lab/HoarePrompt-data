Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `count` remain unchanged. If `l` is less than or equal to `a` and `a` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is less than or equal to `b` and `b` is less than or equal to `r`, `math.gcd(a, b)` equals `x`, and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b)` equals `y`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is equal to `z // (i + 1) * x`, and `a` is equal to `i * x`. `count` is incremented by 1 if `a` equals `b` or by 2 otherwise.***
