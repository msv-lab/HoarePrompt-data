Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, with the constraints that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\). It checks if `y` is divisible by `x`. If not, the function returns `0`. If `y` is divisible by `x`, the function calculates `z` as \(y / x\) and iterates through possible divisors of `z` to find valid pairs `(a, b)`, where both are multiples of `x`, lie within the range \([l, r]\), have a greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x`, and satisfy the condition \(a * b / \text{gcd}(a, b) = y\). The function counts each valid pair and ensures duplicates are counted once if `a` equals `b`. Finally, it returns the count of these valid pairs. Edge cases include handling when either no valid pairs exist or when certain values of `x` or `y` result in restrictions on possible values for `a` and `b`. Overall, the function effectively identifies and counts pairs under specific mathematical properties and constraints.**
