Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer with \( 1 \leq l \leq r \); `r` is an integer with \( l \leq r \leq 10^9 \); `x` is an integer with \( 1 \leq x \leq y \); `y` is an integer with \( y \geq x \); `z` is equal to \( y // x \); `count` is 0; `i` is 1; `a` is equal to `x`; `b` is equal to \( (y // x) * x \); the current value of `a` lies between `l` and `r`; the current value of `b` lies between `l` and `r`; the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`; the product \( \frac{a * b}{\mathit{gcd}(a, b)} \) is equal to `y`; and the current value of `a` is equal to the current value of `b`.***
