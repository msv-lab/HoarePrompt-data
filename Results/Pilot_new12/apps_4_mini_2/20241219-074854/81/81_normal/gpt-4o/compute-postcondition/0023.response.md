Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `count` remain unchanged. If `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r` with `math.gcd(a, b) == x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is updated to `z // i * x`, and if `a` equals `b`, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` is incremented by 2.***
