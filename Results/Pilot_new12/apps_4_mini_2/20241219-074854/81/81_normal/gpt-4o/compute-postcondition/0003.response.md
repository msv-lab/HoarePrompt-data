In this case, `z` is assigned the value of `y // x`, where `//` denotes integer division. Since `y` is divisible by `x`, this operation will yield an integer value for `z`. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `y` ≤ 10^9; `z` is equal to `y // x`**
