meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three values: x and y are integers representing the coordinates of a piece of meat, and c is an integer representing the hardness of that piece of meat (1 <= c <= 100). K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats). T is a positive real number.
