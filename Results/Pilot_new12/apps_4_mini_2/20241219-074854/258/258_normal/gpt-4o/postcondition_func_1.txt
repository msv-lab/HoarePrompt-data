The function `func_2` takes three parameters: a positive integer `N` representing the number of pieces of meat, a positive integer `K` constrained within the range [1, N], and a list `meats` of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i). The function performs a binary search to refine an upper bound `high` based on a convergence process with a lower bound `low`. It evaluates the condition using another function `func_1` during the search process. When the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`, the loop terminates, and the function returns the refined upper bound `high`. The function ensures that `K` remains within the permissible range throughout its execution. It does not handle cases where `K` might be zero or negative since it is always assumed to be positive according to the initial state of the program. The final state of the program consists of returning this refined upper bound, which may be utilized for further calculations or constraints related to the number of pieces of meat.
