The function reads input values to determine the number of meat items and the number of items to analyze, constructs a list of meat items as tuples of coordinates and costs, and then processes these inputs through a secondary function, `func_2`, which likely performs further calculations based on the provided data. The function concludes by printing the result of this computation formatted to six decimal places. The function does not handle cases where the input could be invalid or missing; for example, there's no error checking for the input format or bounds for `N`, `K`, and the meat data. Additionally, the exact behavior of `func_2` and how it processes the `meats` input is not shown, leaving uncertainty about the actual output and its implications.
