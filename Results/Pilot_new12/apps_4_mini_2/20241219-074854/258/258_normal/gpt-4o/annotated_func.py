#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three values: x and y are integers representing the coordinates of a piece of meat, and c is an integer representing the hardness of that piece of meat (1 <= c <= 100). K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats). T is a positive real number.

    N = len(meats)
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):

            if d < 0:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` is unchanged, `N` is the original length of `meats`, `count` is the total sum of weights `c` of meats that met the distance condition, and the final state is such that `count` could be less than, equal to, or greater than `K`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples called 'meats', where each tuple contains the coordinates (x, y) of a piece of meat and its hardness (c). It also takes a positive integer K, representing a threshold for the number of meats to be evaluated, and a positive real number T that influences distance calculations. The function iterates through all pairs of meats, computes a distance condition based on their hardness and coordinates, and counts how many meats fall within a specified distance from a computed midpoint. If the summed weight of these meats (weighted by their hardness) meets or exceeds K, the function returns True. If no pairs produce a count that meets this condition after all evaluations, the function returns False. The 'meats' list remains unchanged by the function's procedures. Edge cases may include situations where all hardness values are equal or if T is very small, potentially leading to situations where no meats are counted. Additionally, if the list of meats contains only one tuple or none, the pairwise comparisons are not performed, resulting in an immediate return of False.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i) satisfying -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 and 1 <= c_i <= 100.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` and `high` converge such that the difference `high - low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`, `mid` is the average of the last values of `low` and `high`. If the loop executed at least once, then `K` remains a positive integer within the range [1, N], and `N` remains a positive integer representing the number of pieces of meat. The output `low` will represent a refined lower bound based on the evaluations of `func_1`.
    return high
    #The program returns the refined upper bound 'high' which is set from the convergence process with 'low', where the difference 'high - low' is less than or equal to '1e-07', and 'K' is a positive integer within the range [1, N] representing the number of pieces of meat.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes three parameters: a positive integer `N` representing the number of pieces of meat, a positive integer `K` constrained within the range [1, N], and a list `meats` of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i). The function performs a binary search to refine an upper bound `high` based on a convergence process with a lower bound `low`. It evaluates the condition using another function `func_1` during the search process. When the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`, the loop terminates, and the function returns the refined upper bound `high`. The function ensures that `K` remains within the permissible range throughout its execution. It does not handle cases where `K` might be zero or negative since it is always assumed to be positive according to the initial state of the program. The final state of the program consists of returning this refined upper bound, which may be utilized for further calculations or constraints related to the number of pieces of meat.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60; K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N; each element in meats is a tuple containing x_i and y_i as integers in the range [-1000, 1000], and c_i as an integer in the range [1, 100].
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `index` is equal to `2 + 3 * N`, `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` contains `N` tuples of the form (data[2], data[3], data[4]), ..., (data[3*N+2], data[3*N+3], data[3*N+4]) if N > 0, otherwise `meats` is an empty list.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values to determine the number of meat items and the number of items to analyze, constructs a list of meat items as tuples of coordinates and costs, and then processes these inputs through a secondary function, `func_2`, which likely performs further calculations based on the provided data. The function concludes by printing the result of this computation formatted to six decimal places. The function does not handle cases where the input could be invalid or missing; for example, there's no error checking for the input format or bounds for `N`, `K`, and the meat data. Additionally, the exact behavior of `func_2` and how it processes the `meats` input is not shown, leaving uncertainty about the actual output and its implications.
