You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and look for potential edge cases or scenarios where it might fail.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to place a heat source optimally to cook K pieces of meat from N given pieces, based on the hardness and coordinates of the meat. The time to cook each piece of meat is determined by the formula, which involves both distance (based on the coordinates of the meat and the heat source) and hardness.

### Program Structure
1. **Function `func_1(meats, K, T)`**: This function checks whether it's possible to have at least K pieces of meat ready within time T. It iterates through pairs of meats and calculates potential positions for the heat source based on their hardness. It appears to be set up to handle pairs of meats and determine if their respective cooking times can be satisfied within the time limit T.

2. **Function `func_2(N, K, meats)`**: This is a binary search function that tries to minimize the cooking time T by repeatedly adjusting the search range based on whether `func_1` can satisfy the cooking of K pieces of meat within the mid-point of the current range.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: This function handles input and output.

### Potential Issues
Upon reviewing the logic carefully:

- The conditional check and calculations in `func_1` for the mid-point mx and my seem a bit suspect. It assumes that for every pair of meats, there exists a valid heat source position that minimizes the cooking time based on their hardness and coordinates.
  
- There could be cases where it fails to find an optimal placement for the heat source if the pieces of meat are positioned in such a way that the best option isn't between any two meats.

### Edge Case Example
For instance, consider this setup:
- Meat 1: `(0, 0, 10)`
- Meat 2: `(1, 1, 10)`
- Meat 3: `(2, 2, 10)`
- K = 3

Here all meats are equidistant from the origin point, and the optimal heat source might need to align with a point not directly between any two meats, especially if all meats have the same hardness but are separated.

If the program relies only on pairs and misses aggregating the total potential directly from the functioning of meat hardness and distance collectively, it may provide incorrect results.

### Conclusion
The program fails to account for all configurations that could yield a potential placement of the heat source, specifically when the optimal cooking point is not represented as a simple average between pairs of meats, which it assumes in its checks.

Thus, the program's logic does not cover all potential arrangements and conditions.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function reads input values to determine the number of meat items and the number of items to analyze, constructs a list of meat items as tuples of coordinates and costs, and then processes these inputs through a secondary function, `func_2`, which likely performs further calculations based on the provided data. The function concludes by printing the result of this computation formatted to six decimal places. The function does not handle cases where the input could be invalid or missing; for example, there's no error checking for the input format or bounds for `N`, `K`, and the meat data. Additionally, the exact behavior of `func_2` and how it processes the `meats` input is not shown, leaving uncertainty about the actual output and its implications.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
