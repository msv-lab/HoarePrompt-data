You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
Functions with output description for each function:

        for j in range(i + 1, N):

            if count >= K:
                return True
    return False
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a list of tuples called 'meats', where each tuple contains the coordinates (x, y) of a piece of meat and its hardness (c). It also takes a positive integer K, representing a threshold for the number of meats to be evaluated, and a positive real number T that influences distance calculations. The function iterates through all pairs of meats, computes a distance condition based on their hardness and coordinates, and counts how many meats fall within a specified distance from a computed midpoint. If the summed weight of these meats (weighted by their hardness) meets or exceeds K, the function returns True. If no pairs produce a count that meets this condition after all evaluations, the function returns False. The 'meats' list remains unchanged by the function's procedures. Edge cases may include situations where all hardness values are equal or if T is very small, potentially leading to situations where no meats are counted. Additionally, if the list of meats contains only one tuple or none, the pairwise comparisons are not performed, resulting in an immediate return of False.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    (low, high) = (0, 1000000000.0)
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    return high
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes three parameters: a positive integer `N` representing the number of pieces of meat, a positive integer `K` constrained within the range [1, N], and a list `meats` of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (x_i, y_i, c_i). The function performs a binary search to refine an upper bound `high` based on a convergence process with a lower bound `low`. It evaluates the condition using another function `func_1` during the search process. When the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`, the loop terminates, and the function returns the refined upper bound `high`. The function ensures that `K` remains within the permissible range throughout its execution. It does not handle cases where `K` might be zero or negative since it is always assumed to be positive according to the initial state of the program. The final state of the program consists of returning this refined upper bound, which may be utilized for further calculations or constraints related to the number of pieces of meat.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        index += 3
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads input values to determine the number of meat items and the number of items to analyze, constructs a list of meat items as tuples of coordinates and costs, and then processes these inputs through a secondary function, `func_2`, which likely performs further calculations based on the provided data. The function concludes by printing the result of this computation formatted to six decimal places. The function does not handle cases where the input could be invalid or missing; for example, there's no error checking for the input format or bounds for `N`, `K`, and the meat data. Additionally, the exact behavior of `func_2` and how it processes the `meats` input is not shown, leaving uncertainty about the actual output and its implications.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
