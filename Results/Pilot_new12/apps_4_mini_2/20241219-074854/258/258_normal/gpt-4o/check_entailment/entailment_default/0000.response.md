The given Python code largely follows the problem description but has some subtleties that warrant close scrutiny.

**Analysis of Functions:**

1. **func_1:** This function evaluates pairs of meats and calculates potential grilling points based on distances and hardness. It counts the number of meats that can be readied within a specified time \( T \). However, it appears there is a significant logical flaw:
   - The function relies on a comparison of two meats' hardness and time values, but the logic for determining how to handle this could lead to an incorrect count of ready meats, especially if the relationship between the hardness values and distance is mismanaged. 
   - The function does not invoke the possibility of other combinations effectively; it primarily compares only pairs of meats.

2. **func_2:** The binary search mechanism is employed correctly, limiting the search space incrementally for the time \( T \). The reliance on `func_1` could be problematic if `func_1` does not correctly determine whether \( K \) pieces are ready. If `func_1` fails at counting, irrespective of how `func_2` handles the search, the outcome will be incorrect.

3. **func_3:** This function handles input correctly and formats the output appropriately. However, it assumes that the meat data is correctly structured, with no consideration for malformed input.

**Identified Edge Case:**
If multiple pieces of meat have extremely low or high hardness values existing in proximity to one another, or if \( K \) is less than half of \( N \), the binary search could converge incorrectly due to the misleading results from `func_1`. Since `func_1` uses a pairwise method that may not account for all valid grilling arrangements for \( K \) pieces, there is a tangible risk of missing combinations that fulfill the requirement.

**Conclusion:**
Due to the issue with `func_1` not ensuring that \( K \) pieces are accounted for correctly, even in cases where they could be optimally grilled, we can conclude that the program does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
