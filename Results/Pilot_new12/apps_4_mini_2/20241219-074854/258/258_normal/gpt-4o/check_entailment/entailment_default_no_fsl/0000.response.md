Correctness: **False**

The program does not guarantee to provide the correct results for every potential case as required by the problem description. Specifically, the implementation of `func_1` is problematic in the way it determines the condition for checking how many pieces of meat can be grilled within the time `T`.

In `func_1`, the program performs pairwise checks between pieces of meat, computing `d` based on a comparison of the hardness values multiplied by `T`. However, it does not take into account scenarios where the optimal heat source placement is such that more than one piece of meat is not simultaneously considered in the distance calculations. For certain input configurations—especially when hardness values vary significantly—this could lead to incorrect counting of meat pieces within the required time, potentially missing the case where more than `K` pieces are grillable within the optimal time.

For example, consider the case where `N=4`, `K=3`, with meat configurations and hardness as follows:

```
(0, 0, 1)
(1, 1, 1)
(1, 0, 1)
(0, 1, 1)
```

With a carefully chosen heat source, one might be able to heat all pieces within a calculable time, but `func_1` may fail to determine this because it focuses on pairs and not on simultaneous optimal placements.

Thus, the program's structure could lead to failing to correctly determine grilling times across certain configurations due to the limited logic in determine valid `mx`, `my` points not considering all meat relative placements. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description for every potential input case.
