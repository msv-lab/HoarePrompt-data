Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem described. Here's an explanation of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads from standard input, where the first line contains `N` and `K`, and subsequent lines contain the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. This matches the problem description's format.

2. **Calculating Time**: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the list of meats, the number `K`, and a time `T`. This function is responsible for checking whether it is possible to grill at least `K` pieces of meat within the time `T` by empirically locating the optimal coordinates for the heat source. It evaluates all combinations of meat pieces to determine if the cooking condition is met.

3. **Binary Search for Optimal Time**: The second function, `func_2`, uses binary search to minimize the time required to grill at least `K` pieces of meat. It continues refining the bounds (`low` and `high`) until their difference is within a specified precision (`1e-07`), ensuring that the result returns an accurate minimum time.

4. **Output Format**: Finally, in `func_3`, the result is printed formatted to six decimal places, which conforms to the output requirements as stated.

The program effectively considers all inputs allowed by the constraints and adheres to the description's rules for how the grilling time is calculated based on the coordinates and hardness of the meat.

Overall, every function correctly incorporates the behavior required by the problem statement, and the logic for determining the time based on the positions of the meat pieces is valid within the constraints provided. Thus, the program meets all requirements set forth in the problem description, confirming its correctness.
