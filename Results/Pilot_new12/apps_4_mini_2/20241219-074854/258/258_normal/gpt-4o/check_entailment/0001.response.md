To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and look for potential edge cases or scenarios where it might fail.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to place a heat source optimally to cook K pieces of meat from N given pieces, based on the hardness and coordinates of the meat. The time to cook each piece of meat is determined by the formula, which involves both distance (based on the coordinates of the meat and the heat source) and hardness.

### Program Structure
1. **Function `func_1(meats, K, T)`**: This function checks whether it's possible to have at least K pieces of meat ready within time T. It iterates through pairs of meats and calculates potential positions for the heat source based on their hardness. It appears to be set up to handle pairs of meats and determine if their respective cooking times can be satisfied within the time limit T.

2. **Function `func_2(N, K, meats)`**: This is a binary search function that tries to minimize the cooking time T by repeatedly adjusting the search range based on whether `func_1` can satisfy the cooking of K pieces of meat within the mid-point of the current range.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: This function handles input and output.

### Potential Issues
Upon reviewing the logic carefully:

- The conditional check and calculations in `func_1` for the mid-point mx and my seem a bit suspect. It assumes that for every pair of meats, there exists a valid heat source position that minimizes the cooking time based on their hardness and coordinates.
  
- There could be cases where it fails to find an optimal placement for the heat source if the pieces of meat are positioned in such a way that the best option isn't between any two meats.

### Edge Case Example
For instance, consider this setup:
- Meat 1: `(0, 0, 10)`
- Meat 2: `(1, 1, 10)`
- Meat 3: `(2, 2, 10)`
- K = 3

Here all meats are equidistant from the origin point, and the optimal heat source might need to align with a point not directly between any two meats, especially if all meats have the same hardness but are separated.

If the program relies only on pairs and misses aggregating the total potential directly from the functioning of meat hardness and distance collectively, it may provide incorrect results.

### Conclusion
The program fails to account for all configurations that could yield a potential placement of the heat source, specifically when the optimal cooking point is not represented as a simple average between pairs of meats, which it assumes in its checks.

Thus, the program's logic does not cover all potential arrangements and conditions.

Correctness: **False**
