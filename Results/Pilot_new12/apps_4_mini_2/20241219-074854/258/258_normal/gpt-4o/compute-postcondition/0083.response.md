The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. From the initial conditions, `y1` is equal to `y2`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `(y1 + y1) / 2` which equals `y1`. The current state of the other variables remains unchanged based on the preconditions provided. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`, `cx` is equal to `x1` (which is equal to `x2`), `y1` is equal to `y2`, `c1` is equal to `c2`, `x2` is equal to the original `x1`, `y2` is equal to the original `y1`, `c2` is equal to the original `c1`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true with the current value of `d < 0`, `cy` is equal to `y1`.**
