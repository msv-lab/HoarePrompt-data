To summarize the impact of the given code:

1. We have `d2` as a newly defined variable and its value is based on some calculated expression (but its specific value is not provided in the initial state).
2. The variable `mx` depends on `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`.
3. The code assigns a new value to `my`, calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

`my` is affected by the calculation using values from `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`. 

The value of `my` is updated based on the provided formula and the specific values of the variables involved. As `d2` is a newly defined variable, it remains relevant in the context of the formula used for calculating `my`.

The output state will indicate that `my` is now a new value calculated, while retaining other variable states and their dependencies.

Output State: **`d2` is newly defined, `mx` is equal to `cx + (dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`, `my` is equal to `cy - (dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`**.
