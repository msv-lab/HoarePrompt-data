To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze step-by-step how the variable `d2` is affected and which other variables' states remain unchanged.

1. **Initial Conditions to Recall**:
   - `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
   - `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`
   - `d2` is calculated as \( (\frac{x1 - x2}{2})^2 + (\frac{y1 - y2}{2})^2 \)

2. **Execution of the Code**:
   - The line `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy` computes the value of `d2` based on the current values of `dx` and `dy`.
   - Since the initial expressions for `dx` and `dy` will be maintained, we can derive that `d2` will equal the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `d2` is now explicitly calculated as `dx * dx + dy * dy`.
   - Other variables retain their values unless they are specifically impacted by this code, which they are not.

4. **Final State**:
   - The updated state of `d2` reflects its new calculation but does not change the values of other variables including `dx`, `dy`, `d`, `c1`, `c2`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `meats`, `N`, `i`, `j`, and `count`.

### Conclusion
Hence, the output state reflecting these changes can be expressed succinctly as:

Output State: **`d` is updated to be equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`; `cx` is calculated as `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is calculated as `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is updated to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`.**
