Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` has been incremented by 1; `j` is set to the value of `N`; `count` is the total count of tuples satisfying the distance condition; if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True; if `count` is less than `K`, the function does not return; all relevant values from the last executed iteration of the loop for `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` are available for reference but may have no impact on the subsequent values as the loop has concluded; the status of `count` serves as the termination condition for the loop.**
