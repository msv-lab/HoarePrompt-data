Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple. `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 2`. `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`, `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`, and `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`. `cx` is equal to `x1`, `cy` is equal to `y1`, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T` and is less than 0, with `dx` equal to 0, `dy` equal to 0, and `d2` equal to 0. `mx` is equal to `cx`, `my` is equal to `cy`, and `count` is less than `K`, with the condition that `c1 * T < c2 * T` being satisfied.***
