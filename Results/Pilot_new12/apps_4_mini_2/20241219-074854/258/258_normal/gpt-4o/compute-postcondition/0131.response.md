The `continue` statement causes the program execution to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since this affects the flow of the program but does not alter any variable values, the state of the other variables remains the same. 

The output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is 10; `y1` is 20; `c1` is 2; `x2` is 10; `y2` is 20; `c2` is 1; `d` is `d / 2` if `d` is less than 0 and continuing to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is 10; `cy` is 20; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
