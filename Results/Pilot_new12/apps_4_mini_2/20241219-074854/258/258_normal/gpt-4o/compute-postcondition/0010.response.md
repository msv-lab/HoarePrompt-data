The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` was 2, so after this operation, `index` will be 5. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 5, `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` contains one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `x` is equal to `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is an integer derived from `data[4]`.**
