Output State: **`d` is less than 0, if `d` is updated to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cy` is now equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `meats` remains a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than 3; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `dy` is calculated as `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is computed as `dx * dx + dy * dy`; `mx` is determined as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `count` is the sum of the number of tuples in `meats`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`**.
