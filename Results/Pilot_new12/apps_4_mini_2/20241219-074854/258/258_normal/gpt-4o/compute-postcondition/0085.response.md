The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. Since `y1` is equal to `y2`, their difference `y1 - y2` is 0. Therefore, `dy` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`; `cx` is equal to `x1`; `y1` is equal to `y2`; `c1` is equal to `c2`; `x2` is equal to the original `x1`; `y2` is equal to the original `y1`; `c2` is equal to the original `c1`; the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true with the current value of `d < 0`; `cy` is equal to `y1`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0.**
