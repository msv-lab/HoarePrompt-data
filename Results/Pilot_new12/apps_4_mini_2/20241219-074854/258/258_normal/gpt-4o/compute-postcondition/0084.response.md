The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. Given that `x2` is equal to the original `x1`, the expression simplifies to `(x1 - x1) / 2`, which equals `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `dx` is now `0`, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`, `cx` is equal to `x1`, `y1` is equal to `y2`, `c1` is equal to `c2`, `x2` is equal to the original `x1`, `y2` is equal to the original `y1`, `c2` is equal to the original `c1`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true with the current value of `d < 0`, `cy` is equal to `y1`, and `dx` is 0.**
