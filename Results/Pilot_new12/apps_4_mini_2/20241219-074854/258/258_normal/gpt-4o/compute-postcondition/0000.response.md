The line of code `data = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into separate components based on whitespace, and assigns that list of components to the variable `data`. Since the variable `data` is specifically being assigned to the input provided by the user, there are no changes to the values of `N`, `K`, or `meats`, but the value of `data` will depend on the user input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 60; `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N; each element in `meats` is a tuple containing x_i and y_i as integers in the range [-1000, 1000], and c_i as an integer in the range [1, 100]; `data` is a list containing the split input components.**
