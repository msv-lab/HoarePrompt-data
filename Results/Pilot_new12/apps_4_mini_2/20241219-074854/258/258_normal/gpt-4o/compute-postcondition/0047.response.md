Postcondition: ***`d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is computed as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `count` is the sum of the number of tuples in `meats`. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True. Otherwise, there is no else part, so no change occurs in the state.***
