According to the code, the for loop executes based on the values of `i` and `N`. The loop will iterate for `j` starting from `i + 1` and continue until `N - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`. 

Currently, the state mentions that `N` must be greater than `i`, which is a necessary condition, but not sufficient for the loop to run. Specifically, for the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than `i + 1` (i.e., `N` must be at least `i + 2`).

Therefore, for the loop to be executable, the following adjustments need to be made:
- Ensure that `N` is greater than `i + 1` (i.e., `N` must be at least `i + 2`)
- The value of `j` will start from `i + 1` at the beginning of the loop execution.

State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 1`**
