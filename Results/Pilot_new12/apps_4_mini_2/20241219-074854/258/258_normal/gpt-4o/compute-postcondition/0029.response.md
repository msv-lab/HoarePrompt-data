The statement `x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]` assigns the values from the tuple at index `j` in the `meats` list to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. The variable `j` is equal to 2, so the values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` will be taken from the third tuple (index 2) in the list `meats`. The other variables remain unchanged as their computed values do not directly depend on the assignment made in this line of code.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `d` is updated to the previous value of `d` divided by `c1 * c2`; `cx` is calculated as (x1 + y2) / 2; `cy` is calculated as (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is computed as (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is calculated as (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to \((\frac{x1 - x2}{2})^2 + (\frac{y1 - y2}{2})^2\); `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `count` is less than K; `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned values from the first tuple in `meats`; `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned the values from the third tuple in `meats`.**
