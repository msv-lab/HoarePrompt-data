Postcondition: ***`d` is updated to be equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`; `cx` is calculated as `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is calculated as `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is updated to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and the condition `d * d2 > d2` will determine whether the loop continues or not. If `d * d2 > d2` is true, the loop continues, maintaining these variable states. If `d * d2 <= d2`, the loop will exit, keeping the variables as previously defined.***
