Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 3`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned to the elements of `meats[j]`, and the current values of `c1` and `c2` satisfy the condition that `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`.***
