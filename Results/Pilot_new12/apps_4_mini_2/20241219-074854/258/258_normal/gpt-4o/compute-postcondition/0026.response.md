The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it utilizes `N`, `K`, and `meats` as input values, which are understood to be provided in the context of its execution.

- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 60\).
- `K` is an integer such that \(1 \leq K \leq N\).
- Each element in `meats` is a tuple containing \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) as integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), and \(c_i\) as an integer in the range \([1, 100]\).

The function has various return outcomes based on the conditions involving these parameters, typically organized into cases, although none are specified in the initial context.

Since the output description is incomplete in this context, we can assume that the function analyzes the input data pertaining to `N`, `K`, and the `meats` tuples and produces a result based on those conditions. The exact nature of the return value (or what it represents) is not detailed.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but uses values N (an integer), K (an integer), and meats (a list of tuples). It analyzes these inputs to produce a result based on their relationships, though the specific return value is not described.**
