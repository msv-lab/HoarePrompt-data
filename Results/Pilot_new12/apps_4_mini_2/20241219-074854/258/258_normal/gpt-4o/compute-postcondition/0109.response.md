The code assigns the value of `d2` to be equal to the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. Given that both `dx` and `dy` are currently 0, the calculation results in `d2` being assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values of the variables are:

- `d2` is equal to 0 (since `dx * dx + dy * dy` = 0 * 0 + 0 * 0 = 0).

The Output State is:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`, `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`, `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `d` is less than 0 and is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `dx` is equal to 0, `dy` is equal to 0, `d2` is equal to 0, `mx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `my` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `count` is less than `K` and the condition that `c1 * T < c2 * T` is still satisfied; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to 0.**
