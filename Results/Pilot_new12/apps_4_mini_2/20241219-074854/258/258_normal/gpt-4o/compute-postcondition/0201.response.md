Postcondition: ***`count` is the sum of weights `c` such that the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `count` is less than `K`; when `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop, maintaining the existing properties of `count`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, and `dy`.***
