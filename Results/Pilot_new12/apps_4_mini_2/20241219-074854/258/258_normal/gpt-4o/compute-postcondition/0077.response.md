The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c1 * T - c2 * T`. Given that the condition \(c1 * T < c2 * T\) still holds true, we can conclude that `c1 * T - c2 * T` will result in a negative value. The states of the remaining variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, if `c1 * T < c2 * T` then `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is equal to `y2`, `c1` is equal to `c2`, `x2` is equal to the original `x1`, `y2` is equal to the original `y1`, `c2` is equal to the original `c1`, and `d` is less than 0 (since `d = c1 * T - c2 * T`).**
