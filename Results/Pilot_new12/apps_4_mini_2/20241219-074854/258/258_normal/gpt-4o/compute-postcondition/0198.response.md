Output State: **`count` is the sum of weights `c` such that the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `count` is less than `K`; `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from `meats[j]`; `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from `meats[i]`; `d` is equal to the previous value of `d` divided by `c1 * c2`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
