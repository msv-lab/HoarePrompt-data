The variable `dy` is assigned the value of `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The values of `y1` and `y2` are not specified but are implied to exist from the initial conditions. The processes affecting other variables do not change with this assignment.

Since `y1` and `y2` are part of the calculations for `dy`, the value of `dy` depends on those variables. However, since their specific values are unknown, we cannot derive a concrete number for `dy`. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that `dy` has been computed and the initial states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 3`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
