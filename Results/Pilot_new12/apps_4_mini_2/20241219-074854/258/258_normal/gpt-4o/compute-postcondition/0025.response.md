The line of code provided is a print statement, which formats the `result` variable to 6 decimal places for display. Since there are no changes to any variables, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `result` has been computed by the function `func_2(N, K, meats)`, but its specific value is not directly provided within the current state. Therefore, we retain the definition of `result` as the output of that function call. 

Output State: **`index` is equal to `2 + 3 * N`, `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` contains `N` tuples of the form (data[2], data[3], data[4]), ..., (data[3*N+2], data[3*N+3], data[3*N+4]) if N > 0, otherwise `meats` is an empty list; `result` is the output of func_2(N, K, meats), and `result` is printed formatted to 6 decimal places.**
