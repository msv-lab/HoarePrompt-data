The value of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` is assigned from the tuple `meats[i]`. Since `meats` is a list of tuples and `i` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be used to access the next tuple in `meats`. As a result, the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` will now reflect the values from the tuple located at the updated index `i`.

The other variables remain unchanged except for `i`, which has incremented by 1, and `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` which now hold the assigned values based on the updated index.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)` and is less than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is equal to `i + 2; `cx` is equal to `x1`; `y1` is equal to the new value of `y1` from `meats[i]`; `c1` is equal to the new value of `c1` from `meats[i]`; `x2` is equal to the original `x1`; `y2` is equal to the original `y1`; `c2` is equal to the original `c1`; `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true; `cy` is equal to `y1`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is equal to 0; `mx` is equal to `cx`; `my` is equal to `cy`; `count` is less than `K`.**
