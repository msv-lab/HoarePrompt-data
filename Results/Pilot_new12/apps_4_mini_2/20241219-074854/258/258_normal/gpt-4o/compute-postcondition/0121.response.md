Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is now equal to `x2`, `y1` is now equal to `y2`, `c1` is now equal to `c2`, `x2` is now equal to the previous value of `x1`, `y2` is now equal to the previous value of `y1`, and `c2` is now equal to the previous value of `c1`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur in the values of `x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2`.***
