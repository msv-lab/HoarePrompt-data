The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead proceeds to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop, skipping the remaining code in the current loop iteration. The values of all relevant variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the sum of weights `c` such that the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`; if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is less than `K`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from `meats[j]`, while `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from `meats[i]`; `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
