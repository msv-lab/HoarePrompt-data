The code assigns the values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` respectively, and then assigns the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. 
Given the initial state:

- `x2` is equal to the first element of `meats[j]`
- `y2` is equal to the second element of `meats[j]`
- `c2` is equal to the third element of `meats[j]`
- `x1` is the prior value of `x2`
- `y1` is the prior value of `y2`
- `c1` is the prior value of `c2`

After executing the code, the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` will become equal to the original values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. Conversely, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` will be updated to the original values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. 

The constants `d`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged, along with the conditions for `meats`, `N`, `i`, and `K`. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than `i + 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is equal to `i + 2; `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`; `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`; `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`; `cx` is equal to `x1`; `cy` is equal to `y1`; `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)` and is less than 0; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is equal to 0; `mx` is equal to `cx`; `my` is equal to `cy`; `count` is less than `K`.**
