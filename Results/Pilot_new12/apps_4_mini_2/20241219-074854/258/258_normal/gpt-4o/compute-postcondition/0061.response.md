The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Based on the initial state, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`. Since both `dx` and `dy` are explicitly defined in terms of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`, `d2` simplifies to `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `cy` is now equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `meats` remains a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than 3; `i` is 0; `j` is 3; `d2` is equal to `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`; `mx` is determined as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `count` is the sum of the number of tuples in `meats`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `dy` remains as `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
