Output State: **`d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is computed as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of the number of tuples in `meats`, `x1` is the first element of the first tuple in `meats`, `y1` is the second element of the first tuple in `meats`, `c1` is the third element of the first tuple in `meats`, `x2` is the second element of the fourth tuple in `meats`, `y2` is the third element of the fourth tuple in `meats`, `c2` is the fourth element of the fourth tuple in `meats`.**
