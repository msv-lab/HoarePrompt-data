The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop. However, no specific changes are made to the initial state variables, and the program continues onto the next iteration of the loop without affecting their values.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`; `cx` is equal to `x1`; `y1` is equal to `y2`; `c1` is equal to `c2`; `x2` is equal to the original `x1`; `y2` is equal to the original `y1`; `c2` is equal to the original `c1`; `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true with the current value of `d < 0`; `cy` is equal to `y1`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is equal to 0; the current value of `d` multiplied by `d2` is greater than `d2`.**
