The code appends a tuple consisting of the values `x`, `y`, and `c` to the list `meats`. The initial values for `x`, `y`, and `c` are derived from the `data` list based on the specified indices. The other variables remain unchanged as they aren't affected by the `append` operation.

After executing the code, `meats` will now contain one tuple with the values `(x, y, c)`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 2, `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` contains one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `x` is equal to `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is an integer derived from `data[4]`.**
