According to the code, the loop will execute `N` times, as it iterates over a range defined by `N`. Thus, whether the loop can execute is directly dependent on the value of `N`. There are no restrictions on the values of `K` or the contents of the `meats` list that affect the execution of the loop itself. 

Since `N` is specified to be an integer, we assume it is non-negative. For the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be greater than or equal to 1. The starting point for the iteration is governed by the loop variable, which is not explicitly defined in this case (indicated by `_`), but since it is ignored in the loop body, it does not need to be altered for the execution.

Thus, to ensure the loop can run correctly, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 2, `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` is an empty list**
