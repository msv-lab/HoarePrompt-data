The code `c = int(data[index + 2])` assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` converted to an integer to the variable `c`. The value of `index` is `2`, therefore `data[index + 2]` is equal to `data[4]`. The initial state does not provide the specific values of `data`, therefore we cannot determine the exact value of `c`. However, we do know that `c` is assigned an integer value based on the 5th item in the `data` list (the item at index 4).

Thus, the variables that are affected are `c` which is now an integer derived from `data[4]`. All other variable conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 2, `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` is an empty list, `x` is equal to `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `c` is an integer derived from `data[4]`.**
