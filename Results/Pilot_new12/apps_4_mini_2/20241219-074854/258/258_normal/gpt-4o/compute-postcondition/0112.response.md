To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's analyze the impacts step by step. We know several things from the initial state and how they relate to the calculation in the code snippet.

### Initial Conditions:
- `mx` is to be updated in the code based on the expression.
- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is equal to 0.
- `d` is less than 0 and is currently equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`.
- `d2` is equal to 0.

### Code Execution:
The code executes:
```python
mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

Given that:
- `dy` is `0`
- `d2` is also `0`

The part of the expression relating to `dy` and `d2` becomes problematic:
- The term `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)` calculates `math.sqrt(0 * d - d * d)` which simplifies to `math.sqrt(- d * d)` (because both `d2` is 0).
- Since `d` is less than 0, `-d * d` is a positive value. So `math.sqrt(-d * d)` is valid, yielding `sqrt(d * d)`, which equals `|d|`.

However, since `dy` is zero, we can simplify:
```python
mx = cx + 0 * (something) / 0
```
This causes a division by zero issue in the term `(dy * math.sqrt(...)) / d2`, which will result in a calculation that is not feasible, but we'll simply assume based on how it logically flows through real execution that the solution wouldn't validly change `mx`.

Thus, `mx` retains its prior value because the additional computation doesn't affect it when `dy` is 0 and you are trying to use `d2` as 0 for the division.

### Final Output State
The condition for `mx` simply carries over:
- `mx` remains unchanged from its earlier state since it could not be validly computed due to zero parameters, barring any specific alterations.

Therefore, our updated output state, reflecting only the calculations involved and retaining the original variable attributes, is as follows:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`, `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`, `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `d` is less than 0 and is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `dx` is equal to 0, `dy` is equal to 0, `d2` is equal to 0, `mx` is unchanged, `my` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `count` is less than `K`, the condition that `c1 * T < c2 * T` is still satisfied, and `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and if `d * d2 > d2`, then the loop is continued.**
