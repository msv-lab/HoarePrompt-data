Postcondition: ***If `d` is less than 0, then `d` is updated to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `meats` remains a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cx` is computed as `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dy` is calculated as `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is computed as `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` is determined as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Additionally, `count` is the sum of the number of tuples in `meats`, and the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are updated as per the given conditions. If the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true, the updates apply; otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
