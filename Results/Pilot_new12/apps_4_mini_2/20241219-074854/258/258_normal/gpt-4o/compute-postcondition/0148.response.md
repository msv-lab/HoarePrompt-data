The `continue` statement does not change any variable values. It simply skips the remaining part of the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the previous state of the variables remains valid after executing the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 3`, and `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T` and d is less than 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
