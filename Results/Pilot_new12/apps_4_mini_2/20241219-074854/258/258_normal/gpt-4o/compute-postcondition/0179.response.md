Output State: **`d` is equal to \( \frac{c1 * T - c2 * T}{c1 * c2} \), `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from `meats[i]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from `meats[j]`, `cx` is equal to \( \frac{x1 + x2}{2} \), `cy` is equal to \( \frac{y1 + y2}{2} \), `dx` is equal to \( \frac{x1 - x2}{2} \), `dy` is equal to \( \frac{y1 - y2}{2} \), `d2` is equal to \( \left( \frac{x1 - x2}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{y1 - y2}{2} \right)^2 \), and the execution continues.**
