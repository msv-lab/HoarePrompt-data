The value of `cy` is assigned the average of `y1` and `y2`. Given that `y1` is 20 and `y2` is 20, the calculation yields:

\[
cy = \frac{20 + 20}{2} = 20
\]

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is 10; `y1` is 20; `c1` is 2; `x2` is 10; `y2` is 20; `c2` is 1; `d` is `d / 2` if `d` is less than 0 and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is 10; `cy` is 20.**
