The `continue` statement affects control flow by skipping to the next iteration of the surrounding loop (if any). However, since no explicit loop is mentioned in the provided snippet, we infer that it will be ignored in the current context. 

Thus, the variables remain unchanged, and the output state will reflect that no modifications occurred and that the program simply proceeds to the next relevant stage without altering values.

Output State: **`d` is updated to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cx` is computed as `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dy` is calculated as `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is computed as `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` is determined as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of the number of tuples in `meats`, `x1` is now equal to the previous value of `x2`, `y1` is now equal to the previous value of `y2`, `c1` is now equal to the previous value of `c2`, `x2` is now equal to the previous value of `x1`, `y2` is now equal to the previous value of `y1`, and `c2` is now equal to the previous value of `c1` if the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true. If the condition does not hold, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
