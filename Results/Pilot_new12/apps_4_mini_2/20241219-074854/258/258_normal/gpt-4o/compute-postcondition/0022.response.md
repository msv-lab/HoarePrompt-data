The value of `index` is incremented by 3, changing its previous value of 10 to 13. The conditions around `N` and `K` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `index` while retaining the conditions on `N` and `K`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 10; `index` is 13; `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `meats` contains the previously existing elements plus a new tuple `(int(data[10]), int(data[11]), int(data[12]))`.**
