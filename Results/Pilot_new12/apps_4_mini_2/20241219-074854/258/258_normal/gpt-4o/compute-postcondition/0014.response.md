The variable `c` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 2])`. The previous state of `c` was derived from `data[4]`, and it will now take the value from the list `data` at the position calculated by `index + 2`. Given the initial state, where `index` is 6, this means `c` will now be equal to `int(data[8])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 6, `index` is 6, `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` contains one tuple `(x, y, c)` where `y` is now the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is now equal to `int(data[8])`, `x` is an integer value `data[6]`.**
