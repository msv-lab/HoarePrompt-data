Output State: **`count` is the sum of weights `c` such that the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is less than `K`, `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, and `count` is updated to the sum of weights meeting the condition.**
