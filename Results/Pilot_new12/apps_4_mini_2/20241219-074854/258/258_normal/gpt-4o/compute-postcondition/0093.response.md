Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)` and is less than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is set to the value of `i + 1; `cx` is equal to `x1`; `y1` is equal to `y2`; `c1` is equal to `c2`; `x2` is equal to the original `x1`; `y2` is equal to the original `y1`; `c2` is equal to the original `c1`; `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true; `cy` is equal to `y1`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is equal to 0; `mx` is equal to `cx`; `my` is equal to `cy`; `count` is the sum of weights for tuples in `meats` where the weighted distance is less than or equal to `T`, and `count` is greater than or equal to `K.***
