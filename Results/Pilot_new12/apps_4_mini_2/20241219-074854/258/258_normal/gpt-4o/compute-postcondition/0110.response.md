The code `continue` does not alter any variable values but instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop, continuing with the next iteration. Thus, the output state reflects that the loop is continued and the current variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`, `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`, `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `d` is less than 0 and is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `dx` is equal to 0, `dy` is equal to 0, `d2` is equal to 0, `mx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `my` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `count` is less than `K`, and the condition that `c1 * T < c2 * T` is still satisfied; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to 0, and the loop is continued.**
