The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The preconditions regarding `meats`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `d`, `cx`, and `cy` are not affected by this operation. The value of `dx` now holds the calculated expression based on `x1` and `x2`. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 3`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2**.
