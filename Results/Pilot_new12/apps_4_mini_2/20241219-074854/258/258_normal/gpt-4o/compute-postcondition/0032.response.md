After running the code `d = c1 * T - c2 * T`, we can determine the new value of `d`. The variables `c1`, `c2`, and `T` would have been defined as part of the tuples in `meats`. 

Assuming that we have the following values:
- Let the third tuple in `meats` be `(x1, y1, c1)`.
- Let the first tuple in `meats` be `(x2, y2, c2)`.

The expression for `d` can be calculated as:
- `d = c1 * T - c2 * T` 
- which simplifies to `d = (c1 - c2) * T`.

The other variables remain unchanged in this context. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`; `cx` is calculated as (x1 + y2) / 2; `cy` is calculated as (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is computed as (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is calculated as (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to \((\frac{x1 - x2}{2})^2 + (\frac{y1 - y2}{2})^2\); `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `count` is less than K; `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned values from the third tuple in `meats`; and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned values from the first tuple in `meats`.**
