Postcondition: ***`count` is the sum of weights `c` such that the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`; if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `count` is less than `K`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from `meats[j]` while `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from `meats[i]`.***
