The variable `my` is assigned the value calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The values of `d`, `dx`, and `cy` are defined as follows:

- `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`

Now, `my` will be calculated using these definitions. The expression simplifies to:

1. Calculate `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d)` which uses the current value of `d` and `d2`.
2. The entire expression for `my` results in substituting the values of `cy` and `dx` into the calculation.

The states of the other variables `meats`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `d2`, `count`, and `cx` do not change. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

Output State: **`d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `meats`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `d2`, `count`, and `cx` retain their precondition values.**
