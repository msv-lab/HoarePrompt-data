Given the initial state that `N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 2, `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` is an empty list, and `x` is an integer equal to the value of `data[2]`, the line of code to execute is `y = int(data[index + 1])`. 

Hereâ€™s the impact of the code:

1. The variable `index` has the value of 2. Therefore, `index + 1` equals 3.
2. The variable `data` is assumed to be predefined. `data[index + 1]` translates to `data[3]`.
3. The value of `data[3]` is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `y`. The specific value of `y` will therefore depend on the contents of `data[3]`.

Since `data` is not specified beyond `data[2]`, we cannot know the specific value of `y`, but we can imply that `y` will be the integer conversion of whatever is contained in `data[3]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 2, `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` is an empty list, `x` is equal to `data[2]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[3]`.**
