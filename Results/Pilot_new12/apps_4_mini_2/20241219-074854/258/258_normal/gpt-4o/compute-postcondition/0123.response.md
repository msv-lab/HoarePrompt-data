The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables were modified or assigned a new value by the `continue` statement, the states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is 10; `y1` is 20; `c1` is 2; `x2` is 10; `y2` is 20; `c2` is 1; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
