The code performs a simultaneous assignment to the six variables: `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. After the assignment, each variable takes the value of the variable from the opposite side of the assignment. The preconditions tell us that `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are defined, coming from the current state of `meats[j]`, and that `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` held values before the assignment.

Specifically, after the code execution:
- `x1` takes the value of `x2`
- `y1` takes the value of `y2`
- `c1` takes the value of `c2`
- `x2` takes the value of `x1` (the original value before the assignment)
- `y2` takes the value of `y1` (the original value before the assignment)
- `c2` takes the value of `c1` (the original value before the assignment)

The variables `N`, `i`, `j`, and the condition c1 * T < c2 * T remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the value of `i + 1`, `x1` is now equal to `x2`, `y1` is now equal to `y2`, `c1` is now equal to `c2`, `x2` is now equal to the original `x1`, `y2` is now equal to the original `y1`, `c2` is now equal to the original `c1`, the condition (c1 * T < c2 * T) still holds true.**
