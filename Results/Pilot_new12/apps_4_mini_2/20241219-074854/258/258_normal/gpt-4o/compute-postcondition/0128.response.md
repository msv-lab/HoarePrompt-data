The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. Given that `x1` is 10 and `x2` is also 10, the calculation results in `(10 - 10) / 2`, which is `0`. The values of other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is 10; `y1` is 20; `c1` is 2; `x2` is 10; `y2` is 20; `c2` is 1; `d` is `d / 2` if `d` is less than 0 and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is 10; `cy` is 20; `dx` is 0.**
