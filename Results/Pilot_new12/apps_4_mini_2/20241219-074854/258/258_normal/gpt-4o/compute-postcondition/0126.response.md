Given the provided code, let's analyze the impact it will have on the initial state.

1. The variable `cx` is computed as the average of `x1` and `x2`.
2. The values of `x1` and `x2` are both equal to 10.
3. Since `cx` is assigned the value of `(x1 + x2) / 2`, we need to evaluate this expression. 

Calculating `cx`:
- `x1 + x2` equals `10 + 10`, which is `20`.
- Dividing by `2` gives us `20 / 2 = 10`.

Thus, `cx` becomes `10`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the current computation.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is 10; `y1` is 20; `c1` is 2; `x2` is 10; `y2` is 20; `c2` is 1; `d` is `d / 2` if `d` is less than 0 and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is 10.**
