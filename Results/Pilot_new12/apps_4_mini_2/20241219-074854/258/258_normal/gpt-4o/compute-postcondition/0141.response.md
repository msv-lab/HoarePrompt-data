The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, meaning that it is now `i + 1`. The value of `j` is equal to `i + 1`, which makes it `j = (i + 1) + 1 = i + 2` after the increment of `i`. The code `x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]` assigns the elements of the tuple stored in `meats` at index `i` to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. Since `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, the tuple access is valid. We have not changed the list `meats`, `N`, or any other variable, so the output state reflects only the updated values of `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is now incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` is assigned to the elements of `meats[i]`**.
