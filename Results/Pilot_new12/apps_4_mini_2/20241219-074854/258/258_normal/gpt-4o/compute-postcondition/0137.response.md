Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `count` is undefined due to division by zero affecting `my`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `x1` is 10, `y1` is 20, `c1` is 2, `x2` is 10, `y2` is 20, `c2` is 1, `d` may remain unchanged, `cx` is 10, `cy` is 20, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, and `d2` is 0. If `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns True; otherwise, no specific else action is performed.***
