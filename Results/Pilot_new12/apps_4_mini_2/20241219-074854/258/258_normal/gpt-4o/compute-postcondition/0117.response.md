According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `N`. The `j` variable starts from `i + 1`, and it will increment during each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is currently equal to `i + 1` and it has not reached `N`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need `j` to be incremented by 1, which means `j` will now be `i + 2`. The condition remains unchanged since we haven't reached the termination limit yet.

State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, count is less than K, j is `i + 2`, N must be greater than `i + 2`**
