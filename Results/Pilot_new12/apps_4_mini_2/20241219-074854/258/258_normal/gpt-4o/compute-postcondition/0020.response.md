The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`. The value of `index` is previously defined as 10, so the value of `c` becomes `int(data[12])`. Other variables (`N`, `K`, `meats`, `y`, `x`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 10; `index` is 10; `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `meats` contains the previously existing elements plus a new tuple `(x, y, c)` where `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`, `c` is now equal to `int(data[12])`, and `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`.**
