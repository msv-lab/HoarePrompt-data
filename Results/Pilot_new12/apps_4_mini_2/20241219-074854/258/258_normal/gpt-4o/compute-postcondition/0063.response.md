Postcondition: ***`d`, `dx`, `cy`, `meats`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `cx`, and `dy` are updated according to the expression if `d * d2 > d2`, with `d` now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `dx` equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `cy` equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The values of `mx` and `my` are determined as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` and `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, respectively, while all other variables retain their precondition values and execution continues.***
