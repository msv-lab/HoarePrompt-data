The variable `mx` is assigned the value of `cx` plus the expression `dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Given that `dy` is 0, the term `dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` simplifies to 0.

Therefore, `mx` becomes equal to `cx`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

The variables `d`, `d2`, and `dy` retain the following states:
- `d < 0` 
- `d2` is equal to 0
- `dy` is equal to 0 

This satisfies the condition that was set regarding `d`, as the multiplication of `d` by `d2` would yield 0, which does not fulfill any meaningful inequality since it is always equal to or less than any `d` that is negative.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than `i + 1`; `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)` and is less than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`; `cx` is equal to `x1`; `y1` is equal to `y2`; `c1` is equal to `c2`; `x2` is equal to the original `x1`; `y2` is equal to the original `y1`; `c2` is equal to the original `c1`; `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true; `cy` is equal to `y1`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is equal to 0; `mx` is equal to `cx`.**
