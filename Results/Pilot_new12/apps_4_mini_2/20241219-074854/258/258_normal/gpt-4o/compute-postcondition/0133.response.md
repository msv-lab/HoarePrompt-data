The variable `mx` is assigned the value of the expression `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Given the initial state: 

- `cx` is 10
- `dy` is 0
- `d2` is 0
- `d` is not explicitly defined, hence we cannot make further calculations without it.

The expression inside the `math.sqrt()` function cannot be evaluated since `d2` is 0, which would cause a division by zero. However, because the other variables are explicitly defined, we can state the values for `mx` based on the current known conditions, but it leads to an undefined scenario due to the division by zero.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values because the calculation cannot be completed:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is 10; `y1` is 20; `c1` is 2; `x2` is 10; `y2` is 20; `c2` is 1; if `d * d2 > d2`, then `d` is set to `d / 2` if `d` is less than 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is 10; `cy` is 20; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is 0; calculation for `mx` is undefined due to division by zero.**
