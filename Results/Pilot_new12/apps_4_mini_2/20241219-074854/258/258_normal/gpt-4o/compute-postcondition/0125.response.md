The value of `d` is assigned to be divided by the product of `c1` and `c2`. Given that `c1` is 2 and `c2` is 1, the result of `c1 * c2` is 2. Therefore, `d` is divided by 2. The other variables remain unaffected, and their previous states hold true.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is 10; `y1` is 20; `c1` is 2; `x2` is 10; `y2` is 20; `c2` is 1; `d` is `d / 2` if `d` is less than 0 and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
