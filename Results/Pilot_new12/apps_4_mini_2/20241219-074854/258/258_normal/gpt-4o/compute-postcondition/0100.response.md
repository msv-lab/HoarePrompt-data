Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`; `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`; `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`; `cx` is equal to `x1`; `cy` is equal to `y1`; `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)` and is less than 0; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is equal to 0; `mx` is equal to `cx`; `my` is equal to `cy`; `count` is less than `K`, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`.***
