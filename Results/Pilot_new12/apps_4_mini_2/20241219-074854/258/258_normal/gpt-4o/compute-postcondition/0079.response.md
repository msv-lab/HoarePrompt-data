The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this context, no variables are reassigned values directly, and no specific calculations or alterations of the values occur from just executing a `continue` statement. 

The values of the variables prior to the `continue` statement remain unchanged, since `continue` merely affects the flow of control and not the variable state.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `d` is less than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is equal to `y2`, `c1` is equal to `c2`, `x2` is equal to the original `x1`, `y2` is equal to the original `y1`, `c2` is equal to the original `c1`, and the relationship `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true with the current value of `d < 0.**
