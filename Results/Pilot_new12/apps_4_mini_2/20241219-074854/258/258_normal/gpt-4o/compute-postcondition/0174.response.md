The variable `cx` is assigned the average of `x1` and `x2`, calculated as `(x1 + x2) / 2`. The states of the variables `d`, `count`, `j`, `N`, `y1`, `c1`, `y2`, and `c2` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is equal to \( \frac{c1 * T - c2 * T}{c1 * c2} \), `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from `meats[i]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from `meats[j]`, `cx` is equal to \( \frac{x1 + x2}{2} \)**.
