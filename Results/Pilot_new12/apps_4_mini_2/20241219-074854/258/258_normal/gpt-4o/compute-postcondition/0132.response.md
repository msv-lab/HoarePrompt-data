Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is 10; `y1` is 20; `c1` is 2; `x2` is 10; `y2` is 20; `c2` is 1; if `d * d2 > d2`, then `d` is set to `d / 2` if `d` is less than 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is 10; `cy` is 20; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is 0.***
