The variable `i` is incremented by 1, which changes its original value to a new value that is one greater than its previous state. Subsequently, `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, which means `j` will now be equal to the value of `i` plus two. As a result of executing the code, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned the values from the tuple located at index `j` in the `meats` list. Since `N` is greater than `i + 1`, this operation ensures that accessing `meats[j]` is valid. 

The states of the variables that are updated are `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. The values of `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` will be the respective elements of the tuple retrieved from `meats[j]`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is now the value of `i + 1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the respective values from `meats[j]`.**
