Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is equal to `y2`, `c1` is equal to `c2`, `x2` is equal to the original `x1`, `y2` is equal to the original `y1`, and `c2` is equal to the original `c1`. The condition (c1 * T < c2 * T) still holds true.***
