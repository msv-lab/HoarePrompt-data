The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values; it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and jump to the next iteration. Given the provided initial conditions, the flow of execution continues, and thus the values of `d2`, `d`, `count`, `j`, `N`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d2` is newly defined, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from `meats[i]`, while `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from `meats[j]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
