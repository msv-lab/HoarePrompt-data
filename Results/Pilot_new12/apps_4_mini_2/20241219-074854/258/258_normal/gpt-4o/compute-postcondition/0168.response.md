The line of code swaps the values of the variables `x1`, `y1`, `c1` with `x2`, `y2`, `c2`. The previous values of these variables are being used in the swap operation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

After executing the line of code, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are now equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and vice versa.

Output State: **`d2` is newly defined, `mx` is equal to `cx + (dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`, `my` is equal to `cy - (dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from `meats[i]`.**
