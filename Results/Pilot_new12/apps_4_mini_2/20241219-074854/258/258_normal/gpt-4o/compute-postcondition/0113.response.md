To derive the output state, we will analyze the code and its impact on the initial state:

1. **Affected Variables**: The code `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` assigns a new value to the variable `my`. The values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d` are used in the calculation.

2. **Initial Values Recap**:
   - `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
   - `dx` is equal to `0`.
   - `d2` is equal to `0`.
   - `d` is less than `0`.

3. **Calculating `my`**:
   - Substituting the initial values into the equation:
     ```
     my = cy - 0 * math.sqrt(0 * d - d * d) / 0
     ```
   - Note that since `dx` is `0`, the first term after the `-` becomes `0`, leading to:
     ```
     my = cy - 0
     ```
   - Therefore, `my` remains equal to `cy`.
   
4. **Output Value**:
   - The only variable that changes is `my`, which retains the value of `cy`.

5. **Other Variables**: All other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`, `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`, `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `d` is less than 0 and is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`, `dx` is equal to 0, `dy` is equal to 0, `d2` is equal to 0, `mx` is unchanged, `my` is equal to `cy`, `count` is less than `K`, the condition that `c1 * T < c2 * T` is still satisfied, and if `d * d2 > d2`, then the loop is continued.**
