Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`; `cx` is calculated as (x1 + y2) / 2; `cy` is calculated as (y1 + y2) / 2; `dx` is computed as (x1 - x2) / 2; `dy` is calculated as (y1 - y2) / 2; `d2` is equal to \((\frac{x1 - x2}{2})^2 + (\frac{y1 - y2}{2})^2\); `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`; `count` is less than K; `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned values from the third tuple in `meats`; and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are assigned values from the first tuple in `meats`. If `d < 0`, the loop continues to the next iteration without executing further statements in the current iteration. Otherwise, the program proceeds with further computations not specified in the given context.***
