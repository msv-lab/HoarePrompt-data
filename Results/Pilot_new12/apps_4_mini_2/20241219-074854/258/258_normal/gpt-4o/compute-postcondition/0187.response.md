The tuple `meats[i]` is unpacked into three variables: `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. Given that `meats[i]` holds a specific value for the index `i`, the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are now determined by the corresponding elements in that tuple. The initial state of `count`, `j`, `N`, and `K` remains valid but has not changed; only the new values for `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` have been assigned.

Output State: **`count` is the sum of weights `c` such that the distance from `(mx, my)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `T`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` must be greater than `i + 2`, and `count` is less than `K`; `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned values from `meats[i]`.**
