Given the provided initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State: `meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is equal to `y2`, `c1` is equal to `c2`, `x2` is equal to the original `x1`, `y2` is equal to the original `y1`, `c2` is equal to the original `c1`, and the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true with the current value of `d < 0`.

Now analyzing the code snippet:
```
cx = (x1 + x2) / 2
```
The variable `cx` is being assigned the average of `x1` and `x2`. Given that it was established that `x1` is equal to `x2`, this means that `cx` will equal `x1` (or `x2`) since the average of two identical values is the value itself.

After processing, the states of the variables are as follows:
- `cx` is equal to `x1`, 
- `x1` is equal to `x2` (let's denote this value as `v`, thus `cx = v`),
- The other variables (`meats`, `N`, `d`, `i`, `j`, `y1`, `y2`, `c1`, and `c2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `d` is equal to the original `d / (c1 * c2)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`, `cx` is equal to `x1` (which is equal to `x2`), `y1` is equal to `y2`, `c1` is equal to `c2`, `x2` is equal to the original `x1`, `y2` is equal to the original `y1`, `c2` is equal to the original `c1`, and the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true with the current value of `d < 0`.**
