Postcondition: ***`d2` is newly defined. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `mx` is equal to `cx + (dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`, `my` is equal to `cy - (dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2)`, `count` is less than `K`, `j` is `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, and `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from `meats[i]`, while `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from `meats[j]`.***
