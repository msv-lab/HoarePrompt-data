The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The state of the variables is unchanged for this specific iteration since no further code is executed after the `continue`. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`; `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`; `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`; `cx` is equal to `x1`; `cy` is equal to `y1`; `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T` and is less than 0; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is equal to 0; `mx` is equal to `cx`; `my` is equal to `cy`; `count` is less than `K`; and if `c1 * T < c2 * T`.**
