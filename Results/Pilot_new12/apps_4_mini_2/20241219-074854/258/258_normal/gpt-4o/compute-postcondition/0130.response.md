The variable `d2` is assigned the value of `dx * dx + dy * dy`. Given the initial values, `dx` is 0 and `dy` is 0. Therefore, `d2` will be calculated as:

- `d2 = 0 * 0 + 0 * 0 = 0`

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is 10; `y1` is 20; `c1` is 2; `x2` is 10; `y2` is 20; `c2` is 1; `d` is `d / 2` if `d` is less than 0 and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is 10; `cy` is 20; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0; `d2` is 0.**
