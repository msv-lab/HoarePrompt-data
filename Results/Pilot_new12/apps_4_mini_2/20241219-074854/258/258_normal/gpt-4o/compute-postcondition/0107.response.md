The variable `dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. Since `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`, this simplifies to `(x1 - prior_value_of_x1) / 2`, which results in `dx` being equal to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`, `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`, `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `d` is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)` and is still less than 0, `dx` is equal to 0, `dy` is equal to 0, `d2` is equal to 0, `mx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `my` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `count` is less than `K` with the condition that `c1 * T < c2 * T` still being satisfied; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is 0.**
