The value of `d` is divided by `c1 * c2`. Given that `d` is less than 0, and since `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `c1` and `c2` must be greater than 0 for the division to be valid. This results in the value of `d` changing to a new value, which is `d / (c1 * c2)`. Other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the Output State reflects the updated value of `d` while keeping the rest of the variables intact.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`, `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`, `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`, `cx` is equal to `x1`, `cy` is equal to `y1`, `d` is now equal to `d / (c1 * c2)` and is still less than 0, with `dx` equal to 0, `dy` equal to 0, and `d2` equal to 0, `mx` is equal to `cx`, `my` is equal to `cy`, and `count` is less than `K` with the condition that `c1 * T < c2 * T` still being satisfied.**
