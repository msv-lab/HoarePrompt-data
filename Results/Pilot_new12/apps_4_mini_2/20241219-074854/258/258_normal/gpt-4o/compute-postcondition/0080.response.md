Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, and `d` is less than 0. If `d` is less than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the value of `i + 1`, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is equal to `y2`, `c1` is equal to `c2`, `x2` is equal to the original `x1`, `y2` is equal to the original `y1`, `c2` is equal to the original `c1`, and the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` holds true with the current value of `d < 0. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged as there is no else part.***
