In the given code snippet, `mx` is calculated using the formula provided, which involves the variables `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`.

1. **Evaluate the Calculations**:
   - `cx` is calculated as `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
   - `dy` is updated to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
   - `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`.
   - The code computes `mx` as follows:

   \[
   mx = cx + dy \times \frac{\sqrt{d2 \times d - d \times d}}{d2}
   \]

   Here, `d`, `d2`, `cx`, and `dy` are already defined in the initial state.

2. **Determine the Scope of Impact**:
   - The calculation of `mx` uses the previously defined variables: `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`.
   - The variable `mx` is a new variable being defined.

3. **Assess Other Variables**:
   - The initial definitions and constraints such as `d`, `meats`, `N`, `i`, and `j` remain valid and unchanged.
   - The condition about the loop using `d * d2 > d2` is about the continuation, but it does not modify `d`, `d2`, or any other variables involved in the calculation of `mx`.

4. **Determine All States**:
   - All information remains valid, and after the computation of `mx`, we now have the value of `mx`, while all other states remain the same.

Output State: **`d` is updated to be equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`; `meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `N` is greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`; `cx` is calculated as `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `dy` is updated to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
