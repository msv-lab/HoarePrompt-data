Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is now the value of `i + 1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the respective values from `meats[j]`, and the condition (c1 * T < c2 * T) holds true, indicating that c1 multiplied by T is less than c2 multiplied by T.***
