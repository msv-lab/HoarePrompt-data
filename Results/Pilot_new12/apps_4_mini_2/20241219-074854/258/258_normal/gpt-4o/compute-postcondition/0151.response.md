The variable `cx` is assigned the value of `(x1 + x2) / 2`. The values of `x1` and `x2` affect `cx`. The states of the other variables (`meats`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `d`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `cx` based on the values of `x1` and `x2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 3`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, and `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.**
