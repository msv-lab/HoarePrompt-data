The variable `cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The prior values of `y2` is the same as `y1`, and since no other variables are directly affected by this assignment, the output state retains the remaining preconditions unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `x2` is equal to the prior value of `x1`, `y2` is equal to the prior value of `y1`, `c2` is equal to the prior value of `c1`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `d` is equal to `d / (c1 * c2)` and is still less than 0, with `dx` equal to 0, `dy` equal to 0, `d2` equal to 0, `mx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `my` is equal to `cy`, and `count` is less than `K` with the condition that `c1 * T < c2 * T` still being satisfied; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
