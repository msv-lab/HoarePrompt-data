The variable `index` is incremented by 3. The initial state shows that `index` is 6, so after executing the code, `index` will be updated to 9. The values of `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 6; `index` is 9; `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `meats` contains the previously existing elements plus a new tuple `(x, y, c)` where `y` is the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is equal to `int(data[8])`, and `x` is the integer value of `data[6]`.**
