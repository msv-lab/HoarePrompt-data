The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `meats`, `K`, and `T`. The `meats` parameter is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three values: two integers `x` and `y` representing the coordinates of a piece of meat, and an integer `c` representing the hardness of that piece of meat, which must be between 1 and 100. The parameter `K` is a positive integer such that its value is between 1 and the length of the `meats` list. The parameter `T` is a positive real number.

The output of the function can vary based on certain conditions:

- Case_1: The function returns `True` if the current value of `count` is greater than or equal to `K`.
- Case_2: The function returns `True`.
- Case_3: The function returns `True`.
- Case_4: The function returns `True`.
- Case_5: The function returns `True`.
- Case_6: The function returns `True`.
- Case_7: The function returns `True`, indicating that the condition related to the variable `count`, calculated from the hardness and coordinates of the meat, is satisfied.
- Case_8: The function returns `True`.
- Case_9: The function returns `True`, indicating that a required condition has been met for the sum of weights based on distance.
- Case_10: The function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of meat coordinates and hardness, an integer value `K`, and a real number `T`, and it returns `True` or `False` based on various conditions evaluated within its logic. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `meats`, a positive integer `K`, and a positive real number `T`, returning `True` or `False` based on multiple internal conditions related to the meat's attributes and distances.**
