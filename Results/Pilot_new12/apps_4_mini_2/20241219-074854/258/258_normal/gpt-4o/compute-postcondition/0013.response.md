The variable `y` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The precondition states that `index` is 6, so `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[7]`. The exact value of `data[7]` is not provided, but it will be interpreted as an integer when `int()` is called. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 6, `index` is 6, `K` is an integer where 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` contains one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `y` is now the integer value of `data[7]`, `c` is an integer derived from `data[4]`, `x` is an integer value `data[6]`.**
