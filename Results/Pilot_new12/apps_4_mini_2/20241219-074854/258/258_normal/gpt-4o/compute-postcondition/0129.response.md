To execute the provided code, we need to calculate the value of `dy`. The initial state of the relevant variables is as follows: 

- `y1` is 20 
- `y2` is 20 

Now, we evaluate the expression for `dy`:

```
dy = (y1 - y2) / 2
```

Substituting the values:

```
dy = (20 - 20) / 2 = 0 / 2 = 0
```

The other variables remain unaffected. 

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples containing at least 1 tuple; `count` is less than `K`; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; `x1` is 10; `y1` is 20; `c1` is 2; `x2` is 10; `y2` is 20; `c2` is 1; `d` is `d / 2` if `d` is less than 0 and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; `cx` is 10; `cy` is 20; `dx` is 0; `dy` is 0.**
