According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `y` from -1000 to 1000. For the loop to execute, we need to confirm that the loop boundary values are correctly set. The initial value of `y` is not specified to change before the loop starts, but it's understood that the loop will assign values to `y` as it iterates.

The important aspects of the state that need to be noted are:
- `x` is -998, which does not affect the loop execution.
- `y` is initialized to 1000 before the loop, but it will be changed during the loop iterations and should start from -1000.
- The variable `K` is defined as a positive integer between 1 and `N`, with `N` also constrained between 1 and 60.
- The variable `ans` is calculated based on `times[K - 1]`, which requires that `K` must be within bounds and implies that the value exists in the `times` list.

For the loop to execute properly:
- `y` must be correctly initialized to -1000 at the beginning of its iteration.
- `K` must be specified to confirm valid access to `times[K - 1]`.
- The `times` list must be already computed for `y = 1000`. 

So, we need to explicitly set `y` to -1000 for the start of the loop and confirm other conditions needed to ensure the loop operates on valid inputs.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, `ans` is the minimum value among times[K - 1] for valid K, `times` is a sorted list calculated for the last value of `y`, i.e., 1000.**
