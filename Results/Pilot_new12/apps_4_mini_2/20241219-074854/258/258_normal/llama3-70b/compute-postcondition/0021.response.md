Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine how the programâ€™s state changes after executing the function `func_2`.

Here's the breakdown:

1. `times` is assigned the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. This means that the value of `times` will depend on the outcome of the function given the current values of `x` and `y`.
2. It's important to note that `x` and `y` are both -999, as specified in the initial state. The values returned by `func_2` will replace `times`.
3. The other variables (`K`, `N`, and `ans`) are unaffected by this specific line.
4. Without the specific implementation of `func_2`, we can't determine the precise values of `times`. However, we can note the dependency on `x` and `y`.

Consequently, the Output State reflects any known values along with the state of `times`. Since we cannot predict the precise content of `times`, we'll describe it generically: `times` will contain the result of invoking `func_2` with `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is now min(previous_value_of_ans, times[K - 1]), `times` is assigned the result of func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)**.
