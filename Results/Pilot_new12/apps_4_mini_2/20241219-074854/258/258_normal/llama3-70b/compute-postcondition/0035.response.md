The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` will be evaluated with the current values of `x` and `y`. The outcome of the function will result in a new list assigned to `times`. Since `times` is to be sorted, we don't know what values it will contain without the specific behavior of `func_2`, but it can be assumed that it will be a list of integers.

The variable `ans` will be updated to reflect the minimum value between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `times` is now defined, `K - 1` needs to be within the bounds determined by the size of `times` after the function is executed.

No information about the previous value of `ans` is available, and therefore we can't specify it. 

The variables `x` and `y` retain their original values. 

Given all this, the output state will include that the variable `times` contains the output of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, and that `ans` is the minimum between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `times` is the output of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]`**.
