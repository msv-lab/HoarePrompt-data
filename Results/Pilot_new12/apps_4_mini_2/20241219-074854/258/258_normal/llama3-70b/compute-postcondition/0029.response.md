According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 inclusive. The loop variable `x` is currently -999 at the end of the last iteration. The range includes 1001 values (from -1000 to 1000 inclusive), so there will be a total of 1001 iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is -999. To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition for the next value of `x`. The next value of `x` will be -998, and since -998 is still within the loop's range (-1000 to 1000), the loop can execute again.

Thus, the state needs to be updated to reflect the next value of `x`.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is the minimum value among the times[K - 1] for all values of `y` from -1000 to 1000, `times` is a sorted list calculated for the last value of `y`, i.e., 1000.**
