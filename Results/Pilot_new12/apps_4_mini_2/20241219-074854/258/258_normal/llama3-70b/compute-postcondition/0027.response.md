To determine the output state after executing the given code, let's analyze the impact of the code line by line based on the initial state:

1. `ans` is updated with the value `min(ans, times[K - 1])`. 
2. The value `ans` will become the smaller value between its previous value and the `K-1`th element of the `times` list. 
3. Given that `times` is a sorted list of its previous values, we proceed to find `times[K - 1]`, which is the K-th element in the list (since indexing starts at 0).

Since we don't have the previous specific values of `ans` or `times`, the output state will indicate that `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and the element in `times`. As `times` is sorted, we denote that `times[K - 1]` can be any value from the sorted order, which maintains its characteristics.

Thus, we finalize the output state with all the pertinent information:

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is now min(previous_value_of_ans, times[K - 1]), `times` is a sorted list of its previous values.**
