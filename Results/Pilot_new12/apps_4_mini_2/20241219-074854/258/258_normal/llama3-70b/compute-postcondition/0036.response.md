To analyze the provided code snippet, we first note that the variable `times` was assigned the output of the function `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`. This means that `times` is a collection of values (possibly a list) that now has some specific values based on the function call. 

The code then proceeds to sort this `times` collection in ascending order with `times.sort()`. We don't have direct information about what values `times` held before sorting or the details about `func_2`. Therefore, we know only that `times` has been altered to be sorted, but the specific contents of `times` and its length (which would influence `times[K - 1]`) remain unknown. 

Itâ€™s important to note that sorting does not affect the other variables: `x`, `y`, or `ans`. Hence, those will remain with their specific values.

With all this in consideration, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `times` is sorted, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]**.
