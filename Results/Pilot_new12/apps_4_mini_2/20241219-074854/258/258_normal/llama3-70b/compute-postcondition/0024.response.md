According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `y`. The loop's range is from -1000 to 1000, meaning it will iterate through 2001 values. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `y` is -999. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, `y` will be updated to -998 for the next iteration. The value of `x` remains unchanged and still is -999, while the other variables (`K`, `N`, `ans`, `times`) are not impacted by the loop's execution but are still needed to maintain the conditions stated.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is now min(previous_value_of_ans, times[K - 1]), and `times` is sorted.**
