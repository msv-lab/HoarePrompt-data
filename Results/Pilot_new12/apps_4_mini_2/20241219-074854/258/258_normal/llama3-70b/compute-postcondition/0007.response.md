After executing the code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`, the variable `times` is assigned the result of the function `func_2` with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged at -1000 and -999, respectively. The variable `K` is a positive integer with constraints, and `N` is defined as the total number of pieces of meat. The variable `ans` is initially equal to `times[K - 1]`, but since `times` has now been redefined, `ans` will reflect the value at `K - 1` after `times` has been updated.

However, we do not have the specific behavior or impact of `func_2`, and its return value is unknown; hence, we cannot determine the specific contents of `times` or the updated value of `ans`.

Thus, the output state includes the unchanged values of `x` and `y`, keeps the conditions for `K` and `N`, and notes the new assignment for `times` and the derived `ans` but without specific values for them.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `times` is the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`.**
