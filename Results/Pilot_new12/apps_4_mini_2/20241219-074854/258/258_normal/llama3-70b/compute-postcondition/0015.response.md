According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than the upper limit of the range, which is 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is -1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

Thus, `x` must be adjusted to -999 for the next iteration. The variables `y`, `K`, `N`, `ans`, and `times` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the increment of `x`.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `ans` is the minimum value among all times[K - 1] across the iterations, `times` is sorted in ascending order for each value of `y`.**
