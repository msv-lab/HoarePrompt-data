Functionality: **The function evaluates all integer combinations of `x` and `y` within the range [-1000, 1000]. For each combination, it invokes another function, `func_2`, to generate a list named `times`, which is sorted. The function calculates the minimum value from the sorted list at the index `K - 1`, where `K` is a defined positive integer (1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ N ≤ 60). After exhausting all combinations of `x` and `y`, the function returns this minimum value. The function does not handle cases where `K` exceeds the length of the `times` list which could occur if `func_2` returns fewer than `K` elements. Thus, if `func_2` does not provide adequate results, the behavior may lead to an index error.**
