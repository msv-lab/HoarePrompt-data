The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly, but it utilizes the values of `x` and `y`, which are integers in the range [-1000, 1000], and `K`, which is a positive integer within the bounds of 1 to N, where N represents the total number of pieces of meat ranging from 1 to 60. After processing, the function returns the minimum value among all times[K - 1] based on all combinations of `x` and `y` within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function uses integers x and y within the range [-1000, 1000] and a positive integer K such that 1 <= K <= N (where 1 <= N <= 60) to return the minimum value among all times[K - 1] for combinations of x and y.**
