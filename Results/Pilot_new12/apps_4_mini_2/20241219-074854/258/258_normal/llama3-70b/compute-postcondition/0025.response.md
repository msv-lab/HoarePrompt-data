The variable `times` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. In this case, `x` is -999 and `y` is -998. The exact impact on `times` depends on the implementation of `func_2`, which is not specified. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific values or structure of `times` generated by that function.

Nothing else in the state is directly affected by this assignment. The previous value of `ans` is still valid, but we cannot update its specific value without knowing the output of `func_2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is now min(previous_value_of_ans, times[K - 1]), and `times` is assigned the output of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`**.
