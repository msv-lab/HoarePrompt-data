According to the code, the loop will execute for `y` values ranging from -1000 to 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. Since the next value of `y` will be -998, the loop is still valid as the range allows for `y` to be incremented.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` will need to be updated to -998. The other variables such as `x`, `K`, `N`, `times`, and `ans` remain unchanged and maintain their previous state.

State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `times` is sorted in ascending order, and `ans` is equal to `min(ans, times[K - 1])**
