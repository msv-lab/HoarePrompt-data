In this task, the `times` variable is sorted in ascending order. The previous state of `times` is derived from the output of the function `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, but the specific values are not given, except that it's a list. 

Initially:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -998
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N
- `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60)
- `ans` is now defined as `min(previous_value_of_ans, times[K - 1])`
- `times` is defined but unsorted at this point.

After executing the code `times.sort()`, the order of the elements within `times` will be updated to be in ascending order, while other variables retain their values and states.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is now min(previous_value_of_ans, times[K - 1]), `times` is a sorted list of its previous values.**
