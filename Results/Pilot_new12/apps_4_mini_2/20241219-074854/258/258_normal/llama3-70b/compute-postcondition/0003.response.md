The function `func_2` is called with parameters `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. The initial values are `x` is -1000, `y` is -1000. The values of `K` and `N` are not affected directly by this line of code, and their conditions still hold.

Assuming `func_2` returns some value based on the inputs (though we do not know its actual output), we can say:

- `times` is assigned the output of `func_2` with the given parameters. However, we do not have the specific implementation of `func_2`, so we can't determine what `times` will be.

Since no other variables are altered, we maintain the original states of `K` and `N`, while updating the state of `times`.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `ans` is positive infinity, `times` is the result of func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)**.
