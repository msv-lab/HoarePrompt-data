The function `func_2` is called with the parameters `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. It is expected to return some value, which will be assigned to the variable `times`. The initial values of `x` and `y` are specified, but the exact output of `func_2` is not known from the information provided. Based on the context, we know `times` will be assigned the result of that function call, but its contents and whether `times` will be sorted are also not specified. Consequently, the variable `times` is updated, but its specific output is unclear.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `times` has been assigned the output of `func_2` and does not provide further specific values or any calculations.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `ans` is the minimum value among all times[K - 1] across the iterations, `times` is the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`**
