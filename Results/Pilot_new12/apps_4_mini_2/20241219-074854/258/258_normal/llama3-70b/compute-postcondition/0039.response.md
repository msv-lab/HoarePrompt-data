The function `func_2` is called with parameters `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Since `x` is -998 and `y` is -998, the input to `func_2` is `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`. The result from this function is assigned to the variable `times`, hence changing the value of `times` to whatever `func_2` returns. The variable `ans` is the minimum value between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, but we don't have the explicit value for `K` or knowledge about its effects.

The states of `x` and `y` remain unchanged after the function call. The output state reflects the transformation of `times` based on the functionâ€™s result and the previous state of `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]**
