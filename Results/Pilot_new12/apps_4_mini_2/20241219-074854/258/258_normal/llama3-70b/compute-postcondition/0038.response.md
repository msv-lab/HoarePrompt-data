According to the code, the loop can execute for each value of `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. In the next iteration, `y` will increase by 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `y` will become -998.

Since the loop iterates until `y` reaches 1000, and currently, `y` is -999, there are still values to iterate over.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is sorted, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]**
