The operation `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. With the assumption that `times` is a list resulting from `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, we do not have information about its contents prior to sorting. The variable `ans` is still defined as the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` across iterations, but this data may change after the sorting operation, depending on the sort order of `times`. The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` across the iterations (which may now change), `times` is sorted in ascending order.**
