The `times` variable, which holds the result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, is sorted in place. The values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged, but `times` is now sorted in ascending order. Since we don't have specific information about the value of `times` before sorting, we cannot describe it precisely, but we can state that it is an ordered list based on the output of `func_2`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `times` is sorted, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]**.
