The `ans` variable is assigned the minimum of its current value and the value at index `K - 1` of the `times` list. Since `times` is sorted, `times[K - 1]` will yield the K-th smallest value in the sorted list.

The initial state specifies that `ans` is positive infinity. After the operation, `ans` will take on the value of `times[K - 1]`, which is a specific value from the sorted list as long as `K` is within the valid range and `times` contains enough elements.

Other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `times`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted.**
