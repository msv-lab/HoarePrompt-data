The `times` variable is assigned the result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, which is not defined here, but it will have an effect on the sorting operation that follows. The `times.sort()` operation will sort the elements in the `times` list. The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans` are not affected by this sorting operation.

After the sorting of `times`, the state of `times` is organized in ascending order, and while `ans`'s previous value remains unchanged immediately after this operation, it still depends on the sorted structure of `times`.

The output state, therefore, consists of the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and an indication that `times` is now sorted.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is now min(previous_value_of_ans, times[K - 1]), and `times` is sorted.**
