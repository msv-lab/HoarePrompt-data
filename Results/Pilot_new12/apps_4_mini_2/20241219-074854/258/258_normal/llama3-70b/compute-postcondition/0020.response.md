According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the current value of `y`. The loop iterates `y` from -1000 to 1000, and it will execute as long as `y` is less than 1000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. For the next iteration, `y` will be incremented by 1, so it will become -999. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` can be any value from -1000 up to 999, therefore the minimum requirement for `y` is -999.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is now min(previous_value_of_ans, times[K - 1]), `times` is sorted in ascending order.**
