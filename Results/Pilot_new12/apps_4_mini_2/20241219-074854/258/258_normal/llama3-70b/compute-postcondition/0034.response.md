According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `y`, starting from -1000 and going to 1000. The loop can execute as long as `y` is less than 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. In the next iteration, `y` will be incremented by 1.

So after the current iteration, `y` will be -999. The `x`, `K`, `N`, and `ans` values do not change during the loop's iterations; they can remain the same unless specified otherwise.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted.**
