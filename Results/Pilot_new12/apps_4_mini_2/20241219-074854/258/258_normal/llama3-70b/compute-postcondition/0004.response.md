The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. The initial values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans` remain unchanged as the sort operation only affects the order of elements in `times`.

Since `times` is the result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)` and we don't know its specific contents before sorting, we can only indicate that `times` is sorted but we don't have any details about the values it contained prior.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `ans` is positive infinity, `times` is sorted.**
