Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, `ans` is the minimum value among the times[K - 1] for all values of `y` from -1000 to 1000, `times` is sorted and calculated for the last value of `y`, i.e., 1000.**
