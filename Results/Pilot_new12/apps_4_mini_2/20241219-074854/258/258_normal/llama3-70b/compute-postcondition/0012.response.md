The `times.sort()` statement sorts the list `times` in ascending order. Since the specifics about the contents of `times` are not provided, we can only describe the impact of the sorting operation. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `times` is sorted, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, times[K - 1])`.**
