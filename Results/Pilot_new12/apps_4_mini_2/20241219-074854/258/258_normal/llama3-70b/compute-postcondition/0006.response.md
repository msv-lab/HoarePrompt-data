According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range for the variable `y`. The loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1. 

After the last iteration, `y` becomes -999, and the loop will continue as long as `y` is less than or equal to 1000. Therefore, the state must reflect the updated value of `y`.

State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`, `times` is sorted.**
