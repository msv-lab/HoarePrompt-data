The variable `ans` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not change the values of `x`, `y`, or `K`, and the initial conditions regarding `x`, `y`, `K`, and `N` remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are integers within the range [-1000, 1000], `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, where `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), and `ans` is positive infinity.
