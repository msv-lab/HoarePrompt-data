The variable `ans` is being updated with the minimum value between its current value and the value of `times[K - 1]`. The initial value of `ans` was equal to `times[K - 1]`, which means after the operation, `ans` will remain the same or take a new value from `times[K - 1]`, but will not exceed the original `ans` value. 

Since `times` is sorted in ascending order, `times[K - 1]` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the original `ans`. Therefore, the outcome depends directly on the value of `times[K - 1]`. 

However, since we are unable to ascertain the exact values of `times` or `ans` unless specific initial conditions or values are given for them, we can generally state that:
- If `times[K - 1]` is less than `ans`, `ans` will now equal `times[K - 1]`.
- If `times[K - 1]` is equal to or greater than `ans`, `ans` will remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state after executing the code can be expressed as follows:

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `times` is sorted in ascending order, and `ans` is equal to `min(ans, times[K - 1])`.**
