The line `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` sets `ans` to the minimum value between its current value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `times` is sorted in ascending order and `K` is a positive integer within the defined bounds, `times[K - 1]` will be a specific value corresponding to the `Kth` piece of meat.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is `-999`
- `y` is `-1000`
- `K` is a positive integer such that `1 <= K <= N`
- `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (where `1 <= N <= 60`)
- `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` across the iterations
- `times` is sorted in ascending order 

The impact of the code is that `ans` will now reflect the minimum of its previous value and the value at the index `K - 1` of the `times` array. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is now min(previous_value_of_ans, times[K - 1]), `times` is sorted in ascending order.**
