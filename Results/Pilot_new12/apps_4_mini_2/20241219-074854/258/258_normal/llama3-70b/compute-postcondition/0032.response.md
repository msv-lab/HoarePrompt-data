Initial State: `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, `ans` is the minimum value among `times[K - 1]` for valid `K`, `times` is updated to the result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`

```
times.sort()
```

Now, please think step by step: The code sorts the list `times`. This operation does not change the values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, or `ans`; it only rearranges the elements in `times`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, `ans` is the minimum value among `times[K - 1]` for valid `K`, and `times` is sorted.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 60, `ans` is the minimum value among `times[K - 1]` for valid `K`, `times` is sorted.**
