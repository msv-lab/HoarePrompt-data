`times` is sorted in ascending order, but the initial values of `times`, `x`, `y`, `K`, and `N` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact state of `times` after sorting. However, we know that the structure and ordering of `times` will change due to the sort operation. The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, and `N` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `times` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is equal to `times[K - 1]`.**
