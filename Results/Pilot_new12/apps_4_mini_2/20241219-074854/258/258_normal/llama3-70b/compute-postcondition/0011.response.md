To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the function call `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` on the program.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -998
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60)
- `times` is sorted in ascending order
- `ans` is equal to `min(ans, times[K - 1])`

The execution of the code line `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` will invoke the function `func_2` with the current values of `x` and `y`. The exact behavior of `func_2` is undefined in this context, but we will assume it processes `x` and `y` and modifies `times` accordingly. Importantly, since `times` will now hold the result of this function call, its previous values will be replaced.

Following this, we'll determine the relationship between the variables:
- The sorting condition implies `times` is a sorted list (array).
- The variable `ans` will be modified by the expression `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])`, which means `ans` will now hold a value that is the minimum of its previous value and the element at index `K - 1` of the newly assigned `times`.

Since we do not change `x`, `y`, `K`, or `N` directly, but we do change `times` and potentially `ans`, we shall summarize those changes.

As we cannot determine the exact values of `times` or `ans` without the specifics of `func_2`, we can only articulate the changes conceptually based on our assumptions.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= `N` <= 60), `times` is assigned values from func_2 and sorted, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, times[K - 1])`.**
