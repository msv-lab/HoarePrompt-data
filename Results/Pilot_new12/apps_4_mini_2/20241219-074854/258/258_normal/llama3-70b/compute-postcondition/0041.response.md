The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. The initial state indicates that `ans` is the minimum value of itself and the value at index `K - 1` in the sorted list `times`. The variable `K` is assumed to be such that `times[K - 1]` is valid and does not lead to an out-of-bounds error. The states of the other variables (`x` and `y`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Thus, the output state maintains the values of `x`, `y`, and the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `times[K - 1]`**
