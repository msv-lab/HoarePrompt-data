The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, which are real numbers representing coordinates on a two-dimensional plane. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two points represented by these coordinates, specifically the distance between the point (x, y) and the point (X, Y). The distance is computed using the formula `sqrt((X - x)
