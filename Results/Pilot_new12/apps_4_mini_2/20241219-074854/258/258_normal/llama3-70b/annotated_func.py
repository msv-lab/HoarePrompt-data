#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, X, and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates in a two-dimensional plane.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y) calculated using the formula sqrt((X - x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, which are real numbers representing coordinates on a two-dimensional plane. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two points represented by these coordinates, specifically the distance between the point (x, y) and the point (X, Y). The distance is computed using the formula `sqrt((X - x)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y are the coordinates of a piece of meat represented as integers, X, Y are the coordinates of the heat source represented as real numbers, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer (x_i, y_i) and a positive integer (c_i).
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list of tuples where each value is calculated as c_i multiplied by the result of func_1(x, y, X, Y) for each tuple (x_i, y_i, c_i) in the meats list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integer coordinates (x, y) for a piece of meat, real number coordinates (X, Y) for a heat source, and a list of tuples called 'meats,' where each tuple contains an integer position (x_i, y_i) and a positive integer coefficient (c_i). It returns a list of products where each element is the product of the respective coefficient (c_i) from the 'meats' list and the output of another function (func_1) evaluated with the provided coordinates (x, y, X, Y). There is an implicit assumption that the 'meats' list is defined in the scope where this function is called, which can lead to potential errors if 'meats' is not provided or is empty. The function does not handle cases where 'meats' could be undefined or contain invalid types, nor does it check if 'func_1' potentially returns any exceptional values. Additionally, there is no check for handling negative coefficients, even though the annotation specifies that coefficients should be positive, which could lead to unintended consequences if inputs are not validated.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers within the range [-1000, 1000], and K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, where N is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60).
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is the minimum value among all times[K - 1] for all combinations of `x` and `y` in the range [-1000, 1000], `times` is a sorted list calculated for the last values of `x` and `y`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value among all times[K - 1] for all combinations of `x` and `y` in the range [-1000, 1000], where `x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function evaluates all integer combinations of `x` and `y` within the range [-1000, 1000]. For each combination, it invokes another function, `func_2`, to generate a list named `times`, which is sorted. The function calculates the minimum value from the sorted list at the index `K - 1`, where `K` is a defined positive integer (1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ N ≤ 60). After exhausting all combinations of `x` and `y`, the function returns this minimum value. The function does not handle cases where `K` exceeds the length of the `times` list which could occur if `func_2` returns fewer than `K` elements. Thus, if `func_2` does not provide adequate results, the behavior may lead to an index error.
