Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements stated in the problem description. Here are several reasons why:

1. **Functionality for Calculating Times**:
   - The `func_2` function attempts to calculate the grill times for each piece of meat by using the coordinates of the heat source as parameters. However, it overwrites the local variables `x` and `y` from the function arguments with the same variable names `x` and `y` from the list of meats due to tuple unpacking. This can lead to confusion and possible errors, as the intended coordinates of the heat source are not explicitly passed.

2. **Grid Search Implementation**:
   - The `func_3` function performs a brute-force search over a grid defined by x and y coordinates ranging from -1000 to 1000. While this approach is logically coherent, the exhaustive search approach is inefficient. More importantly, the granularity of the search intervals (integer increments) may lead to missing the optimal position of the heat source since the best position can be at non-integer coordinates. This violates the desire for an accurate minimal cooking time.

3. **Output Precision**:
   - The problem statement requires the answer to have an absolute or relative error of at most \(10^{-6}\). This specific requirement is not addressed in the code. The program simply returns `ans`, which is determined by integer coordinates. Thus, without a more granular capture of the optimal point, it may not satisfy the condition necessary for the output's precision.

Due to these points, particularly the issues surrounding the handling of coordinates and the numerical precision required, the program does not correctly follow the problem description as specified.
