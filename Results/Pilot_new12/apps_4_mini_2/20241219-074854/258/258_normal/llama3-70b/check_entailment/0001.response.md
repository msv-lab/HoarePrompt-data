Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not satisfy the problem requirements for every potential case due to the following reasons:

1. **Coordinate Range**: The program iterates through all integer coordinates from -1000 to 1000 for the heat source, which limits the real-number placement of the heat source. The optimal placement may not always be at an integer coordinate, and the problem specifies that \(X\) and \(Y\) can be any real numbers. 

2. **Selection of K Pieces**: The program calculates the time for all pieces of meat and sorts them to find the K-th minimum time. However, the time at which K pieces are ready is determined by the K-th shortest time after calculating the grilling times for all pieces. The sorting logic does not necessarily ensure that the minimum required time for K pieces is correctly derived in cases where the K-th piece could be less than the desired \(K\) when using the chosen coordinate. 

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not consider edge cases where it might be optimal to place the heat source at non-integer points (e.g., midpoints). For example, if two pieces are very close to each other and others further away, then the optimal point might lie somewhere between them.

Due to these issues with coordinate handling and selection logic, the program will not give the correct time under all circumstances, leading us to conclude its correctness as false.
