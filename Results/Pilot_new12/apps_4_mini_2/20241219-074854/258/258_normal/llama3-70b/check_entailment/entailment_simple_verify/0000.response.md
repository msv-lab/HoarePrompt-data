Upon analyzing the provided code, its annotations, and the original assessment, I find that the issues highlighted in the original assessment still hold true. 

The program's logic has a significant flaw due to incorrect parameter usage in `func_2`. The function is expected to compute cooking times for all meats when considering a heat source at coordinates (X, Y). However, it is incorrectly called with the same `(x, y)` for both the meat's coordinates and the heat source's coordinates, resulting in an incorrect calculation of times.

Moreover, the reliance on a `meats` global variable without proper declaration or initialization prior to its usage also poses a serious correctness issue. Such a global dependency may lead to runtime errors or unexpected results if the expected variable is not defined.

Despite what the annotations state about the expected input being valid, this program does not correctly implement the requisite logic for determining the optimal heat source location, which is crucial to solving the problem as described.

Given these points, the original assessment remains accurate; the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
