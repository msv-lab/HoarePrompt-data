To analyze the program's correctness based on the given problem description, we need to examine the logic and flow of the code. The task is to find the optimal location (X, Y) for a heat source such that K pieces of meat can be cooked in the least amount of time.

Upon reviewing the provided code:

1. **Function 1**: `func_1(x, y, X, Y)` calculates the Euclidean distance between the heat source (X, Y) and a piece of meat located at (x, y). This part seems correct.
  
2. **Function 2**: `func_2(x, y, X, Y)` computes the cooking time for all pieces of meat located at (x, y), returning a list of times by applying the hardness coefficient `c` to the distance calculated by `func_1`. However, the parameters `(x, y)` are not utilized in its input signature but are referenced with `meats`, which is presumably a global variable that is expected to be defined outside of the function. This reliance on a global variable may lead to unexpected behavior.

3. **Function 3**: `func_3()` iterates through all integer coordinates from (-1000, -1000) to (1000, 1000) inclusive to determine the optimal cooking time by using `func_2`. However, there is an issue in that:
   - The `func_2` has a signature of `func_2(x, y, X, Y)` but it is incorrectly called as `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where it uses the same parameters instead of passing the current piece's meat coordinates.
   - In addition, if the list consists of only K pieces, the sorting may result in accessing an index that does not exist, leading to an `IndexError`.

### Key Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Global State**: There is no definition or initialization of `meats`. If `meats` is not defined globally before calling `func_3`, it will lead to a NameError.
- **Index Handling**: The program does not adequately handle small values of N and K correctly, specifically when the number of pieces of meat is equal to K, because it assumes there will always be more pieces to sort.

In conclusion, due to the reliance on an undefined variable and improper parameter usage without careful handling of the cooking time list, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**.
