You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
Annotated Functions:
import math

(N, K) = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    (x, y, c) = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
print(func_3())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, X, and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates in a two-dimensional plane.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x, y) and (X, Y) calculated using the formula sqrt((X - x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, which are real numbers representing coordinates on a two-dimensional plane. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two points represented by these coordinates, specifically the distance between the point (x, y) and the point (X, Y). The distance is computed using the formula `sqrt((X - x)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y are the coordinates of a piece of meat represented as integers, X, Y are the coordinates of the heat source represented as real numbers, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer (x_i, y_i) and a positive integer (c_i).
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list of tuples where each value is calculated as c_i multiplied by the result of func_1(x, y, X, Y) for each tuple (x_i, y_i, c_i) in the meats list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integer coordinates (x, y) for a piece of meat, real number coordinates (X, Y) for a heat source, and a list of tuples called 'meats,' where each tuple contains an integer position (x_i, y_i) and a positive integer coefficient (c_i). It returns a list of products where each element is the product of the respective coefficient (c_i) from the 'meats' list and the output of another function (func_1) evaluated with the provided coordinates (x, y, X, Y). There is an implicit assumption that the 'meats' list is defined in the scope where this function is called, which can lead to potential errors if 'meats' is not provided or is empty. The function does not handle cases where 'meats' could be undefined or contain invalid types, nor does it check if 'func_1' potentially returns any exceptional values. Additionally, there is no check for handling negative coefficients, even though the annotation specifies that coefficients should be positive, which could lead to unintended consequences if inputs are not validated.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers within the range [-1000, 1000], and K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, where N is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60).
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60), `ans` is the minimum value among all times[K - 1] for all combinations of `x` and `y` in the range [-1000, 1000], `times` is a sorted list calculated for the last values of `x` and `y`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value among all times[K - 1] for all combinations of `x` and `y` in the range [-1000, 1000], where `x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and `N` is the total number of pieces of meat (1 <= N <= 60).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function evaluates all integer combinations of `x` and `y` within the range [-1000, 1000]. For each combination, it invokes another function, `func_2`, to generate a list named `times`, which is sorted. The function calculates the minimum value from the sorted list at the index `K - 1`, where `K` is a defined positive integer (1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ N ≤ 60). After exhausting all combinations of `x` and `y`, the function returns this minimum value. The function does not handle cases where `K` exceeds the length of the `times` list which could occur if `func_2` returns fewer than `K` elements. Thus, if `func_2` does not provide adequate results, the behavior may lead to an index error.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
