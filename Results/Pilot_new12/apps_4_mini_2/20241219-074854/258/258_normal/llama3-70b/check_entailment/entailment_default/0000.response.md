The given Python program aims to find the minimum time required to grill K out of N pieces of meat by strategically placing a heat source on a two-dimensional plane. Let's analyze the provided functions based on the problem description and the output hints.

### Analysis of Functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - This function computes the Euclidean distance between two points `(x, y)` and `(X, Y)`. 
   - The hints accurately describe the functionality of the code.
   - This function seems correct as it correctly implements the required calculation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function generates a list of times based on the distance calculations using `func_1`, adjusted by the respective hardness coefficients of the meats.
   - The hints explain that there is a potential issue with scope if `meats` is not defined in the right scope. However, based on the provided context, we assume this variable is always properly initialized.
   - No checks for negative coefficients exist, but since the problem states that `c_i` is always positive, this isn't an issue that disqualifies correctness.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function iterates through all integer combinations of `x` and `y` in the range [-1000, 1000] and evaluates the times to grill the meat.
   - The hint suggests that the function does not handle cases where `K` exceeds the length of the `times` list. However, since `K` is guaranteed to be <= `N`, and `N` is the number of different pieces of meat being considered, it implies that there should always be enough pieces to satisfy `K`.
   - The function appears to operate correctly under the problem constraints provided, calculating the minimum time to grill K or more pieces of meat.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the functions, they all seem to work as intended according to the problem description. The check for `K` being within valid bounds is implicitly handled by the constraints provided. Therefore, there are no identified cases where the functions do not meet the problem requirements or where potential edge cases violate the specifications of returning valid results.

Hence, we conclude that the code correctly implements the logic as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
