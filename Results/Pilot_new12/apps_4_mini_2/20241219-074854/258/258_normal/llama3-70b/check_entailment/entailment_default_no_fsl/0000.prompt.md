You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
Functions with output description for each function:
import math

(N, K) = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    (x, y, c) = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
print(func_3())

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, which are real numbers representing coordinates on a two-dimensional plane. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two points represented by these coordinates, specifically the distance between the point (x, y) and the point (X, Y). The distance is computed using the formula `sqrt((X - x)
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [c * func_1(x, y, X, Y) for (x, y, c) in meats]
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts integer coordinates (x, y) for a piece of meat, real number coordinates (X, Y) for a heat source, and a list of tuples called 'meats,' where each tuple contains an integer position (x_i, y_i) and a positive integer coefficient (c_i). It returns a list of products where each element is the product of the respective coefficient (c_i) from the 'meats' list and the output of another function (func_1) evaluated with the provided coordinates (x, y, X, Y). There is an implicit assumption that the 'meats' list is defined in the scope where this function is called, which can lead to potential errors if 'meats' is not provided or is empty. The function does not handle cases where 'meats' could be undefined or contain invalid types, nor does it check if 'func_1' potentially returns any exceptional values. Additionally, there is no check for handling negative coefficients, even though the annotation specifies that coefficients should be positive, which could lead to unintended consequences if inputs are not validated.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
    return ans
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function evaluates all integer combinations of `x` and `y` within the range [-1000, 1000]. For each combination, it invokes another function, `func_2`, to generate a list named `times`, which is sorted. The function calculates the minimum value from the sorted list at the index `K - 1`, where `K` is a defined positive integer (1 ≤ K ≤ N and 1 ≤ N ≤ 60). After exhausting all combinations of `x` and `y`, the function returns this minimum value. The function does not handle cases where `K` exceeds the length of the `times` list which could occur if `func_2` returns fewer than `K` elements. Thus, if `func_2` does not provide adequate results, the behavior may lead to an index error.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
