Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the requirement that the heat source can be placed at any real number coordinates (X, Y), not just integer coordinates as it is currently implemented in `func_3()`. The loops in `func_3()` only iterate over integer values from -1000 to 1000 for both X and Y, which limits the potential configurations of the heat source and may prevent finding the true optimal position for the heat source.

This is particularly problematic because the problem explicitly states that the heat source can be placed at any real-valued coordinates, and hence, the solution must account for all potential real-valued positions, not just integer ones. Therefore, there may exist cases where the optimal heating time cannot be attained by this approach, leading to incorrect results. 

Additionally, while the existing structure may handle cases with valid inputs and produce meaningful output for the given sample, it fails to fulfill the problem constraints completely by not allowing the exploration of the real plane for the heat source's coordinates.
