Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. Here's why it does so:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`, which correspond to the number of skewers and the number of skewers affected on each side when another skewer is turned. This matches the problem description's input requirements.

2. **Calculation of Actions**: The formula used to calculate the number of actions (`l`) is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula divides the total number of skewers by the effective range affected by each action (`k*2 + 1`). This ensures that every skewer will be turned over using the minimum number of actions, adhering to the problem's goal of efficiency.

3. **Generating Skewer Positions**: The program then constructs the list of skewers to be turned in each action using a loop and the notation `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. This correctly computes the starting skewer positions that will encompass the range of skewers turned over during that action.

4. **Output**: The program prints the number of actions followed by the positions of the skewers that are to be turned. This aligns perfectly with the output format specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The edge case where `k` is zero, meaning that each skewer must be turned individually, is also handled appropriately. In such a case, each action would only affect one skewer, and the loop generates the correct sequence of skewer positions.

All potential edge cases described in the problem, as well as the essential logic outlined, have been incorporated into the program accurately. Therefore, it is correct according to the problem description.
