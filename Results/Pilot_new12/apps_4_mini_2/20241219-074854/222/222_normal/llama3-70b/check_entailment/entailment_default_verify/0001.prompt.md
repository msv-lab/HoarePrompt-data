You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program, particularly how it calculates the minimum number of operations (turnovers) needed and which skewers are selected for turnover.

1. The program begins by reading the integers `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of adjacent skewers that are turned over).
2. The variable `l` calculates the minimum number of actions required by using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula effectively calculates how many full groups of skewers can be turned over. The group size is `k * 2 + 1` since it includes `k` skewers from the left and `k` skewers from the right of the skewer being turned.
3. It then constructs a list of actions (`res`) where each action corresponds to a skewer turn that is spaced out by `(k * 2 + 1)`. This is implemented using a loop that runs `l` times and appends each calculated skewer index to the result list.

Now, let's check the possible edge cases and scenarios:

- **Example where `n = 1` and `k = 0`:**
  - The output should be `1` and the skewer turned should be `1`.
  - The program outputs `1` and `1`, which is correct.

- **Example where `n = 7` and `k = 2`:**
  - The output should be `2` and the skewers turned should be `1` and `6`.
  - The program outputs `2` and `1 6`, which is correct.

- **Example where `n = 5` and `k = 1`:**
  - The output should be `2` and the skewers turned could be `1` and `4` (or any combination that covers all skewers).
  - The program outputs `2` and `1 4`, which is correct.

However, we must consider potential corner cases:
- **Case with `n = 1` and `k = 1`:**
  - Expected output: 1 action should be required, and only skewer `1` should be turned.
  - Program outputs: `1` and `1`, which is correct.

- **Case with higher skewers and `k = 0`:**
  - For `n = 10`, expected output would be `10` and the skewers should be turned `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10` (or any combination that turns all).
  - Here, the program outputs `10` and the skewer turned should be `1, 2, ..., 10`, which would not be produced by the current logic as it picks only every `(k * 2 + 1)`, which does not hold for `k=0`.

Thus, we’re able to find cases where the logic fails since it does not produce the correct skewer turning sequence under certain settings of `n` and `k`.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not consistently produce the expected results for scenarios involving `k = 0`, especially when `n` is larger than `1`. For instance, with `n = 10` and `k = 0`, the program would suggest turning `1`, which misses turning `2` to `10` directly, leaving other skewers untouched, thus failing the requirement in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integers, `n` (a positive integer representing the number of skewers) and `k` (a non-negative integer representing the number of skewers turned from each side in one action). It calculates how many complete actions are required to turn all skewers based on the parameters `n` and `k`, and stores the starting positions of the skewers that would be turned during these actions in a list called `res`. After processing, it outputs the number of actions required (`l`) and the positions stored in `res`. Edge cases include scenarios where `k` is zero which would result in a significant number of actions (one for each skewer) since there can be no skewers turned simultaneously. The function does not explicitly return any value but relies on printing the results instead.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
