You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the minimum number of actions needed for Miroslav to turn over all skewers, taking into consideration the effect of turning one skewer and how many skewers it affects based on the parameter `k`.

The program logic can be broken down as follows:

1. It reads two integers `n` (number of skewers) and `k` (number of skewers turned on each side).
2. It computes the minimum number of actions `l` required to turn all skewers by the formula: `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`. This formula works by determining how many full segments of skewers can be covered in each action.
3. The program then collects the indices of skewers that need to be turned in a list `res`, by calculating the position as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for each action.

### Possible Edge Cases to Consider

1. **When `n` is smaller than or equal to `k`:**
   - For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the algorithm will calculate `l` as `1`, meaning only one action is needed. In this case, turning skewer `1` will affect all skewers.
   
2. **When `n` is exactly `k * 2 + 1`:**
   - For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 2`. The program would calculate `l` as `1`, but the output would need to include an action turning skewer `3` to cover all skewers. However, the computed positions imply only one action will be effective.

3. **When `k = 0`:**
   - This means turning a skewer affects only itself. A minimum action required would be equal to `n`. The formula would need to consider this special case, but the initial implementation might not explicitly handle a scenario where every skewer needs its own action.

### Analyzing an Example Scenario
Consider `n = 5` and `k = 0`. The minimum number of actions should be `5`, corresponding to turning skewers `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`. However, the algorithm computes `l` as `5 // 1 = 5`, and gives the output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` itself, which is correct in this case.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the logic, the core calculation `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` correctly identifies how many actions are necessary based on `n` and `k`. The subsequent logic that gathers the positions to turn is consistent with the expected operations.

However, there's potential ambiguity since certain edge conditions may not be explicitly defined in this logic when `k` equals `0`. But because the function effectively covers the necessary scenarios upon detailed analysis, and because it computes actions calculated by `l` correctly, one can argue it adheres to the problem description broadly.

Thus, after checking the above parameters and logic:

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integers, `n` (a positive integer representing the number of skewers) and `k` (a non-negative integer representing the number of skewers turned from each side in one action). It calculates how many complete actions are required to turn all skewers based on the parameters `n` and `k`, and stores the starting positions of the skewers that would be turned during these actions in a list called `res`. After processing, it outputs the number of actions required (`l`) and the positions stored in `res`. Edge cases include scenarios where `k` is zero which would result in a significant number of actions (one for each skewer) since there can be no skewers turned simultaneously. The function does not explicitly return any value but relies on printing the results instead.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
