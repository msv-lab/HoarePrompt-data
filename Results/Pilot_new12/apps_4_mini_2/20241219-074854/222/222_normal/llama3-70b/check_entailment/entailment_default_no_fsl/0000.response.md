To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python code against the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the functionality of the code.

### Code Analysis

The function begins by reading the input values `n` (the total number of skewers) and `k` (the number of skewers turned from each side in one action). 

1. **Calculating actions needed**: The line `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` computes the minimum number of actions required. The logic here divides the total number of skewers `n` by the span of skewers affected by one action (`k * 2 + 1`). This essentially calculates how many complete sets of skewers can be flipped with each action.

2. **Storing positions**: The loop `for i in range(l):` generates the positions of the skewers that will be turned over during each action. The calculation for the position as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` aims to capture the first skewer in each action block.

3. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the number of actions and the positions of the skewers that are to be turned.

### Edge Cases

- **When `k=0`**: The edge case where no skewers are turned over from either side requires a total of `n` actions, because each skewer must be flipped individually. The code will correctly compute `l = n`, and append `1, 2, ..., n` to the result.

- **When `k` is larger**: If `k` is greater than or equal to `(n-1)/2`, the entire row of skewers can be turned by a single operation from the right position. This case is also handled correctly by the code since `l` will compute to 1, capturing the first skewer correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the implementation and considering edge cases, it is clear that the code meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all possible values of `n` and `k`. It calculates the minimum number of actions needed and accurately identifies the skewers to turn based on the rules provided.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning:

Correctness: **True**
