Final: **False**

The original assessment concluded that the program was correct based on its logic for calculating the minimum number of operations and selecting which skewers to turn. However, upon further scrutiny with the provided annotated version and the problem description, it becomes evident that the program fails to account for certain scenarios, particularly when `k` is `0`.

When `k` is `0`, each skewer must be turned individually, leading to an expected output that is different from what the program will generate. For instance, with `n = 10` and `k = 0`, the program only targets the first skewer instead of turning each skewer from `1` to `10`. This clearly violates the requirement to ensure all skewers are turned over.

Therefore, the program does not consistently satisfy the problem requirements across all edge cases, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed incorrect. The original assessment's oversight in this area highlights its inaccuracy, as it did not consider the implications for cases with `k = 0` adequately.
