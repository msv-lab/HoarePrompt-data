To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of actions required for Miroslav to turn over all skewers, as well as correctly identifies which skewers to turn over.  

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program takes two integers, `n` (the number of skewers) and `k` (the number of skewers turned from each side) from user input.

2. **Calculation of Actions**:
   - `l` is calculated as `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` which determines the minimum number of actions required. This formula is appropriate because it ensures that for every group of `(k * 2 + 1)` skewers, one action is needed to turn them over. The addition of `k` and `-1` allows flooring integer division effectively.

3. **Identifying Skewers to Turn**: 
   - The loop iterates `l` times to create a list `res` which contains the indices of skewers to be turned over. The skewers chosen are calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which correctly identifies skewers starting from 1 and skipping `(k * 2 + 1)` skewers after each action. It ensures that the skewers turned fall within the range of `1` to `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the number of actions needed `l` and the indices of the skewers.

### Consideration of Edge Cases

1. **New Condition When k=0**:
   - When `k = 0`, only the targeted skewer `i` needs to be turned, meaning each skewer would need to be turned one at a time. The program correctly calculates `l` as equal to `n`, leading to an output that corresponds to all indices.

2. **When n is Divisible by (k * 2 + 1)**:
   - When `n` is a perfect multiple of `(k * 2 + 1)`, the program will still compute the result correctly as `l` will linearly correspond to `n`.

3. **Full Coverage**:
   - The program guarantees that in every iteration of turning a skewer, it covers the required `(k * 2 + 1)` skewers total (where `k` on both sides of the targeted skewer). 

### Conclusion

The program meets the requirements of the problem description for all edge cases and scenarios articulated above. The calculated number of actions `l` and the skewers outputted in `res` will always ensure that all skewers from `1` to `n` are turned over with the minimal number of actions required.

Thus, the program is correct. 

Correctness: **True**
