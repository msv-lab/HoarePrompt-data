According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l`. The loop will execute if `l` is at least 1. Since `l` is calculated as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, we need to ensure that this expression evaluates to at least 1.

For the expression to be at least 1, the numerator `(n + k - 1)` must be at least equal to the denominator `(k * 2 + 1)`. Thus, the condition we want to ensure is that:

```
n + k - 1 >= k * 2 + 1
```

This simplifies to:

```
n >= k + 2
```

Additionally, since `i` will vary from 0 to `l - 1`, we will set `i` to 0 before entering the loop, as that represents the starting point for the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the necessary states are:

- `n` must be at least equal to `k + 2`
- `i` is now 0
- `k` is a non-negative integer within the defined range

State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer on the range (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
