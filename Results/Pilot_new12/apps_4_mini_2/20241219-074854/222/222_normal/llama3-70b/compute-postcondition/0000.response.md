The variable `n` is assigned a positive integer that represents the number of skewers, and `k` is assigned a non-negative integer that represents the number of skewers turned from each side in one action. The values of `n` and `k` now depend on the input received from `input().split()`, which will be converted to integers.

The previous constraints on `n` and `k` remain valid, but their specific values will be updated based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is the input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000)**
