The line `res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)` computes a new value based on the current value of `i` and `k`. Given that `i` is currently `0`, we can substitute it into the expression.

Since `i` is `0`, the new value to be appended to `res` becomes:

```
0 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
```

The initial state indicates that `res` is an empty list, so after executing the code, we add `1` to `res`.

The values for other variables (`n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `res` list.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer on the range (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, `res` contains [1], `i` is 0**
