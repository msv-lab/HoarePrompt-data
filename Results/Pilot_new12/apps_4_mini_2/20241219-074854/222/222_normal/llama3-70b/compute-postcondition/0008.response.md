`res` is updated by appending the value of `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. Here, `i` is 2 and the value of `k` can range from 0 to 1000, resulting in `k * 2 + 1` ranging from 1 to 2001. Therefore, `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` will produce a value from 3 to 4003, depending on the specific value of `k`. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer on the range (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be at least 3, `res` contains [1, k * 2 + 2, 2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1], `i` is 2**
