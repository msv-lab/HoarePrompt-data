According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute again relies on the variable `i` and the calculated value of `l`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and it is given that `n` must be at least `k + 2`, which means `l` is calculated as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.

To have the loop execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Since `i` is currently 0, for it to be able to execute again, `i` must become 1, which means we can iterate while `i` is less than `l`. Thus, `l` must be at least 2 (so that `i` can be 0 and 1). 

Since `l` is determined by `l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, for `l` to be at least 2, the expression `(n + k - 1)` must be at least `2 * (k * 2 + 1)`.

Hence, the conditions for the state at the start of the next iteration can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer on the range (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be at least 2, `res` contains [1], `i` is 1**
