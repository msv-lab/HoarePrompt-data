The code appends to the list `res` a value calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. The variable `i` is 1, thus the expression simplifies as follows:

1. Calculate `k * 2 + 1`, which yields an odd integer since `k` is a non-negative integer.
2. Multiply the result by `i` (which is 1), giving `k * 2 + 1`.
3. Add 1 to that value, resulting in `k * 2 + 2`.

Since `res` originally contains `[1]`, after executing the code, `res` will now contain `[1, k * 2 + 2]`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the information about `res` is updated with the new appended value. 

Therefore, the final output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer on the range (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` must be at least 2, `res` contains [1, k * 2 + 2], `i` is 1**
