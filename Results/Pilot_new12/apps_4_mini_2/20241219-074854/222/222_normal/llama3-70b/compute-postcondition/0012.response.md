The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as defined in the function signature. However, it operates on two implied values: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of skewers, and `k`, which is a non-negative integer representing the number of skewers turned from each side in one action.

Given the constraints:
1. `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000).
2. `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000).

In terms of output:
The function's behavior needs clarification based on the unspecified output, but if `n` and `k` influence the output based on specific conditions or calculations, those conditions must be identified to describe the functionality. Without an output specification, we cannot finalize the description of the functionality.

However, from the information provided:
- The function likely performs some operation based on `n` and `k`, potentially related to the flipping of skewers and how many skewers are effectively turned after a set of actions.

Functionality: **The function processes the skewers represented by a positive integer n and the operations defined by a non-negative integer k, but specific return values and behavior are not clearly defined.**
