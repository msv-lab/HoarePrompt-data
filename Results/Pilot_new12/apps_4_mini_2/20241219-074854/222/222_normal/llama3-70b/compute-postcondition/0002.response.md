The variable `res` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state shows the current state of the affected variables.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is the input non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `l` is calculated as (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1), `res` is an empty list**
