The code prints the elements of the list `res`, which contains `l` elements based on the previous state. The state of the other variables is not affected as the print statement only outputs the list as a string. The value of `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, `res` contains `l` elements which are `[1, k * 2 + 2, 2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1, ..., (l-1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1]`, `i` is `l - 1`, and `l` has been printed.**
