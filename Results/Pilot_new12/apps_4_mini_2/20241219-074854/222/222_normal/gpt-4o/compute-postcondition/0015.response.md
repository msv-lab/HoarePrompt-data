Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000) and a non-negative integer `k` (0 <= k <= 1000). It generates a list of odd integers starting from 1 and continues incrementing by `2*k + 1` until the next increment would exceed `n`. The function then prints the count of these odd integers and the integers themselves, forming the final state of the output. There is a functionality to output the number of odd integers generated and their values, but it does not return any values or handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or where k is negative, as those conditions are outside the defined parameter constraints.**
