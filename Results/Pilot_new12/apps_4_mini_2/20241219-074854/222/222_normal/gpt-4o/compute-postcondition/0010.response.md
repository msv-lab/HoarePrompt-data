After executing the code, `i` will be incremented by `(2 * k + 1)`. Since `i` was initialized with the value `4 * k + 3`, we can calculate the new value of `i` as follows:

`i` = `(4 * k + 3) + (2 * k + 1)`
   = `4 * k + 2 * k + 3 + 1`
   = `6 * k + 4`

The values of `n` and `positions` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the increment operation on `i`. In the initial state, `n` must be greater than `4 * k + 3` and is greater than or equal to `2 * k + 2`, and `positions` contains the values `[1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `4 * k + 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * k + 2`, `positions` is now [1, `2 * k + 2`, `4 * k + 3`], `i` is `6 * k + 4`**.
