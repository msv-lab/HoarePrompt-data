The variable `i` is assigned the value `2 * k + 2`. The code `positions.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `positions`. Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k + 2`, this means that the value of `i` is valid in this context. The state of `positions` changes from `[1]` to `[1, i]`, where `i` is equal to `2 * k + 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `positions` is now [1, 2 * k + 2], `i` is equal to `2 * k + 2`.**
