According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and its comparison to `n`. The loop condition states that the loop will continue to run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and given that `n` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 1. Therefore, since `i` (which is 1) is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute at least once without needing to modify any states.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
