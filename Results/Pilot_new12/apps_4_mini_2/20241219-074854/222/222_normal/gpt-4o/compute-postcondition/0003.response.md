`positions` is updated to include `i`, which is currently 1. Since `positions` was initially an empty list, it will now contain the value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `positions` is now [1], `i` is 1**
