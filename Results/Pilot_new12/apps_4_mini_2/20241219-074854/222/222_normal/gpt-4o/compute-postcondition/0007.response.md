The value of `i` is incremented by `2 * k + 1`. The previous value of `i` was `2 * k + 2`, so the new value of `i` becomes `i + (2 * k + 1) = (2 * k + 2) + (2 * k + 1) = 4 * k + 3`. The values of `n` and `positions` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `positions` is now [1, 2 * k + 2], `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000), `positions` is now [1, 2 * k + 2], `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3**.
