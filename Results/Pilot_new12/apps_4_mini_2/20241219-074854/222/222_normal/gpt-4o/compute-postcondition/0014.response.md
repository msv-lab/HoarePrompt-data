The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Parameter `n` is a positive integer, constrained such that 1 <= n <= 1000. Parameter `k` is a non-negative integer, constrained such that 0 <= k <= 1000. 

The output of the function based on these inputs is not provided in your message. Therefore, without specific output cases, I cannot detail the return values. Please provide the conditions or any specific output that the function is expected to generate based on its parameters to continue.
