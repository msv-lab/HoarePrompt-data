`positions` will have the value of `i` appended to it. Since `i` is equal to `4 * k + 3`, the updated list for `positions` will be `[1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3]`. The initial conditions for `n`, `positions`, and `i` are still valid. Therefore, the final output state reflects these updated values while keeping the original conditions intact.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4 * k + 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 * k + 2, `positions` is now [1, 2 * k + 2, 4 * k + 3], `i` is equal to 4 * k + 3**
