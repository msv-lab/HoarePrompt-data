#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), and k is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000).
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is greater than `n`, `positions` contains all odd integers starting from 1 up to the last odd integer less than or equal to `n` based on the incrementation rule defined by `k`, and `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000).
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000) and a non-negative integer `k` (0 <= k <= 1000). It generates a list of odd integers starting from 1 and continues incrementing by `2*k + 1` until the next increment would exceed `n`. The function then prints the count of these odd integers and the integers themselves, forming the final state of the output. There is a functionality to output the number of odd integers generated and their values, but it does not return any values or handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or where k is negative, as those conditions are outside the defined parameter constraints.
