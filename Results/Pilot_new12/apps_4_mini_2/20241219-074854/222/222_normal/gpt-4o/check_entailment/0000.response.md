To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we first analyze the logic of the program and see if it fulfills all the requirements.

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The function takes two input integers, `n` (the number of skewers) and `k` (the number of skewers affected on each side when one is turned). 
2. The logic in `func_1` starts with an index `i` initialized to `1` and adds `i` to the `positions` list. After that, it increments `i` by `2*k + 1`, which means moving to the next skewer that would require a turn after affecting `k` skewers from either side.
3. It collects all the indices of skewers that should be turned and prints the total number of those indices and then the indices themselves.

**Potential Issues:**
The main issue arises in how the code determines which skewers need to be turned. Specifically, the condition `i += 2 * k + 1` means that for every step, the skewer index is incremented to skip over `k` skewers on either side plus the skewer being turned itself. This will work correctly if the skewers are considered in non-overlapping groups based on the actions needed, but there can be cases where this logic fails due to the value of `k` impacting the coverage of skewers.

Consider the following edge case: 
- If `n = 5` and `k = 2`, then when turning skewer `1`, it affects skewers `[1, 2, 3]` and if it then moves to turn skewer `6`, that skewer does not exist. Therefore, it must reassess the skewers, yet the current increment skips over the necessary sites based on the previously turned skewers.

In this specific case:
- The program would attempt to run `i` from `1` to `5` and skip to the next required skewer, which will result in missing skewer `4` as it will not be turned.

Thus, for the case `n = 5` and `k = 2`, the output will be incorrect because skewer `4` would still be in its original position after the operations prescribed.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not cover all the requirements of the problem described and misses proper handling for various values of `n` and `k`.

Correctness: **False**.
