The program does not operate according to the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.

The output hints indicate that the function `func_1` generates a list of skewers to be turned by starting at 1 and incrementing by `2*k + 1`. While this seems reasonable for turning over skewers, there are particular cases that show the logic may fail. For example:

1. If `n` is odd and `k` is 0, the function will only suggest turning over skewer 1, resulting in skewers 2 to n not being turned at all. In this case, the function will indicate that all skewers have been turned, even though it has missed turning skewers 2 to n, which is incorrect.

2. If `n = 5` and `k = 2`, the function calculates which skewers to turn over based on the distance `2*k + 1`, which means it turns the skewer at position 1, and then jumps to position 6 which exceeds `n`. Here, skewer 2, 3, 4, and 5 will remain in their initial state which again leads to an incorrect result.

These concerns suggest that the algorithm does not correctly handle all configurations of `n` and `k`.

Thus, the program fails to satisfy the problem's requirements across various potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
