Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

While the code correctly identifies the positions of skewers to be turned over using the increment of `2*k + 1`, it fails to account for all necessary cases:

1. When `k = 0`, the program generates every odd position starting from 1, which means that skewers at even positions remain unturned, thereby not achieving the objective of turning over all skewers.

2. When `n` is even, the program may miss turning some skewers that need to be turned over based on the given `k` value. For example:
   - For `n = 6, k = 1`, the skewers to turn (positions) should be {1, 6} which turns skewers {1, 2, 3} and {6} correctly. 
   - However, if `n = 5` and `k = 1`, turning 1 and 4 will cause skewer 3 to remain unturned, contradicting the problem requirements.

The handling of the positions doesn't ensure that all skewers from 1 to n are turned over correctly. There are cases where the output will fail to satisfy the conditions set forth in the problem description. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect in its implementation.
