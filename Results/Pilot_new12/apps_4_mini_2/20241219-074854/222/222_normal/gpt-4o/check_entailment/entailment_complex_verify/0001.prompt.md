You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        i += 2 * k + 1
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze it based on the problem description.

The task is to find the minimal number of actions Miroslav needs to take to turn over all skewers, given that when he turns skewer number \(i\), it affects \(k\) skewers on either side (from \(i-k\) to \(i+k\)).

The provided program defines a function `func_1` which proceeds as follows:

1. Reads input values for \(n\) (the total number of skewers) and \(k\) (the range of skewers affected by a turn).
2. Initializes an empty list `positions` to track which skewers will be turned over.
3. Uses a while loop to iteratively determine which skewer to turn next:
   - It starts with the skewer at position 1.
   - It adds the current skewer's position to `positions` and then moves to the next valid skewer by skipping \(2k + 1\) positions (i.e., skipping the skewers that would be turned by the current skewer).
4. Finally, it prints the number of actions and the list of skewer positions that were turned over.

Now, let's identify whether this logic meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code

The code effectively chooses skewers based on the formula \(2k + 1\). This means that when a skewer at position \(i\) is turned, it turns skewers from \(i-k\) to \(i+k\) (a total of \(2k + 1\) skewers if all of them exist within the valid range). Therefore, by skipping \(2k + 1\) positions, the program ensures that it turns over the maximum number of skewers per action, while ensuring that the next action does not overlap with the previously affected skewers.

### Edge Cases

- If \(k = 0\): Each skewer will only affect itself. The program will then select every skewer individually, and the output will be \(n\) since it will take \(n\) actions (1 action per skewer).
- If \(k \geq n\): The first action can cover all skewers in one go (the skewer at position 1 will turn over all skewers), leading to only one action needed.

### Counter-Examples

We also need to check if there's a case where the chosen positions do not turn over all skewers.

Testing with \(n = 6\) and \(k = 1\):
- Input: `6 1`
- The expected positions are: The first turn will be at skewer 1, turning skewers 1, 2, 3 (current actions).
- The next valid turn would be at skewer 4, turning skewers 4, 5, 6.

This validates that the approach leads to correct and minimal actions where all skewers get affected.

Considering all edge cases and the analysis above, no flaw can be found:

### Conclusion

Since I can't find an input case in which the program fails to meet the problem's requirements, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
func_1(n, k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), and k is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000).
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is greater than `n`, `positions` contains all odd integers starting from 1 up to the last odd integer less than or equal to `n` based on the incrementation rule defined by `k`, and `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 <= k <= 1000).
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000) and a non-negative integer `k` (0 <= k <= 1000). It generates a list of odd integers starting from 1 and continues incrementing by `2*k + 1` until the next increment would exceed `n`. The function then prints the count of these odd integers and the integers themselves, forming the final state of the output. There is a functionality to output the number of odd integers generated and their values, but it does not return any values or handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or where k is negative, as those conditions are outside the defined parameter constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
