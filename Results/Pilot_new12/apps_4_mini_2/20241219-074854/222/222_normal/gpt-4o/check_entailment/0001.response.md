To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze it based on the problem description.

The task is to find the minimal number of actions Miroslav needs to take to turn over all skewers, given that when he turns skewer number \(i\), it affects \(k\) skewers on either side (from \(i-k\) to \(i+k\)).

The provided program defines a function `func_1` which proceeds as follows:

1. Reads input values for \(n\) (the total number of skewers) and \(k\) (the range of skewers affected by a turn).
2. Initializes an empty list `positions` to track which skewers will be turned over.
3. Uses a while loop to iteratively determine which skewer to turn next:
   - It starts with the skewer at position 1.
   - It adds the current skewer's position to `positions` and then moves to the next valid skewer by skipping \(2k + 1\) positions (i.e., skipping the skewers that would be turned by the current skewer).
4. Finally, it prints the number of actions and the list of skewer positions that were turned over.

Now, let's identify whether this logic meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code

The code effectively chooses skewers based on the formula \(2k + 1\). This means that when a skewer at position \(i\) is turned, it turns skewers from \(i-k\) to \(i+k\) (a total of \(2k + 1\) skewers if all of them exist within the valid range). Therefore, by skipping \(2k + 1\) positions, the program ensures that it turns over the maximum number of skewers per action, while ensuring that the next action does not overlap with the previously affected skewers.

### Edge Cases

- If \(k = 0\): Each skewer will only affect itself. The program will then select every skewer individually, and the output will be \(n\) since it will take \(n\) actions (1 action per skewer).
- If \(k \geq n\): The first action can cover all skewers in one go (the skewer at position 1 will turn over all skewers), leading to only one action needed.

### Counter-Examples

We also need to check if there's a case where the chosen positions do not turn over all skewers.

Testing with \(n = 6\) and \(k = 1\):
- Input: `6 1`
- The expected positions are: The first turn will be at skewer 1, turning skewers 1, 2, 3 (current actions).
- The next valid turn would be at skewer 4, turning skewers 4, 5, 6.

This validates that the approach leads to correct and minimal actions where all skewers get affected.

Considering all edge cases and the analysis above, no flaw can be found:

### Conclusion

Since I can't find an input case in which the program fails to meet the problem's requirements, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
