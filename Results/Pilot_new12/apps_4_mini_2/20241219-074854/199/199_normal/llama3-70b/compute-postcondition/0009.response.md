According to the code, whether the loop can carry on executing depends on the values of `b`, `a`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `n` is greater than 3 and if the condition is such that `b` is incremented during the iteration, the new value of `b` needs to be computed.

Assuming `b` has been increased by 1 during the last iteration, the next state of `b` should be checked against the condition for the loop to execute again. The maximum value for `b` will be `(n - a) // 2`. 

If `b` was increased by 1 during the previous iteration, its new value should now be `(previous_value_of_b + 1)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2`.

Thus, if we set `b` to be one increment up and evaluate whether the condition meets for loop continuation:

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` remains unchanged, `b` must be less than or equal to (n - a) // 2**
