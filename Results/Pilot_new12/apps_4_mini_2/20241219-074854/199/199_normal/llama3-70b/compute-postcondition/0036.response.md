Output State: **`ways` is the count of unique pairs `(2, b)` satisfying the condition `2 * (a + b) == n`, where `n` is a positive even integer of at least 6, `a` is `n // 2 + 1`, `b` is within the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, and `a` is distinct from each counted `b`. If the loop does not execute, `ways` remains as the initial count of unique pairs, which is based on the initial conditions of `n` and `a`.**
