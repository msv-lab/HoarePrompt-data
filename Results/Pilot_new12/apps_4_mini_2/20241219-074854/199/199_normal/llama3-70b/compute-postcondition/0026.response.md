According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `b` starting from `a` (which is `n // 2 + 1`) up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute, the starting point `a` must be less than or equal to the ending point `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. 

Given that:
- `a` is calculated as `n // 2 + 1`.
- We need to ensure the conditions around `n` and the values of `a` and `b` hold true.

First, since `n` must be even and at least 6, `n` must take one of the values `6, 8, 10,...`. 

When `n` is 6:
- Then `a = 6 // 2 + 1 = 4`.
- The ending point calculation becomes `(6 - 4) // 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
  
Since `4` (start) is greater than `2` (end), the loop does not execute.

When `n` is 8:
- Then `a = 8 // 2 + 1 = 5`.
- The ending point calculation becomes `(8 - 5) // 2 + 1 = 3 / 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
  
Since `5` (start) is still greater than `2` (end), the loop does not execute.

When `n` is 10:
- Then `a = 10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
- The ending point would be `(10 - 6) // 2 + 1 = 4 / 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

Since `6` (start) is greater than `3` (end), the loop still does not execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to find the smallest even number `n` such that `a` is less than or equal to the calculated ending point, which is not achievable here with the state provided. 

In conclusion, we need to ensure that:
- `n` must be at least 10,
- `ways` must be recalculated but is not directly pertinent to the loop execution,
- `a` must be limited to be less than or equal to the ending point derived from `n`.

State: **`ways` is the count of unique pairs where `n` is at least 10 and `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`**.
