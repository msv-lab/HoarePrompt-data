Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `ways` is the count of unique pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` equals `n/2`, `a` is 1, and `b` is in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2` inclusive, with the condition that `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`. If there are no valid pairs found, `ways` remains 0.**
