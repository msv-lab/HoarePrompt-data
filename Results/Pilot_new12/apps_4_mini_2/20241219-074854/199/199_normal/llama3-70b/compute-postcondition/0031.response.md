The code `ways += 1` increments the value of `ways` by 1. It does not affect any of the other variables `n`, `a`, or `b`, which retain their previous values and states as per the initial condition. The count of unique pairs, represented by `ways`, increases as per the program's requirements. 

Output State: **`ways` is increased by 1; `n` is at least 10, `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is the next incremented value of `b` that satisfies `b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.**
