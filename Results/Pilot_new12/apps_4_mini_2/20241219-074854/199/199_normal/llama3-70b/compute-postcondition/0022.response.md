The value of `ways` is incremented by 1, while the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The variable `n` must still be at least 7, and its exact value does not affect the output state as it has not been altered. Therefore, the output state reflects that.

Output State: **`ways` is increased by 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 4, `n` must be at least 7**
