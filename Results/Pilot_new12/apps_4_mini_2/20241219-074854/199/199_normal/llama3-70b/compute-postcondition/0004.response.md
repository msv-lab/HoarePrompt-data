The code increments the value of `ways` by 1. The initial value of `ways` is 0, so after executing the code, `ways` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `ways` is 1, `a` is 1, and `a` is not equal to `b` while `2 * (1 + b)` equals `n`.**
