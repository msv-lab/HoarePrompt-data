According to the code, the for loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1 after the last iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the state is such that `b` takes on a value less than `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Since `b` is the next incremented value, for the loop to execute again, the new value of `b` needs to be equal to the previous value plus 1. 

Given that `n` is guaranteed to be at least 10 and that `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, it follows that `b` must be the next possible increment which would be `b + 1`.

Thus, we need to update `b` to be the next value and check what the new constraints are for the range.

State: **`ways` is increased by 1 if `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, `b is incremented to be the next value after the last iteration (i.e., b + 1), and b < (n - a) // 2 + 1.**
