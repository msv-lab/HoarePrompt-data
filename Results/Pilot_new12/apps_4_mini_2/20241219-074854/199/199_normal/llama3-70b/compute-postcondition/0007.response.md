The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ways` is 1, so now `ways` becomes 2. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unaffected. Given that `n` is greater than 3 and `a` has a condition based on `b`, this information still holds post-execution.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `ways` is 2, `a` is 1 if `a` is not equal to `b + 1` and `2 * (1 + (b + 1))` equals `n`, otherwise `ways` remains 0, `b` is `b + 1`**
