Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9. It calculates and returns the count of unique pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that `a + b` equals `n / 2` and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `n` is odd or less than 2, the function returns 0, since in those cases, no valid pairs can satisfy the condition. The function does not handle negative values or values of `n` greater than the specified limit, but its logic confines `n` to the stated range.**
