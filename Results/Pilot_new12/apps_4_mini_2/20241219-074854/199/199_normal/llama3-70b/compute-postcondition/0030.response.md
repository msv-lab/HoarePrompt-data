According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `b` and the upper limit of the range defined by `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, since we know that `n` is at least 10 and that `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, we need to identify the current value of `b` and ensure it can increment to allow another iteration of the loop. 

From the loop specification, it starts with `b` equal to `a` and increments until it reaches the upper limit of `(n - a) // 2`. Therefore, for one more execution of the loop, `b` must satisfy the condition: `b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.

If we denote the current value of `b` at the end of the last iteration, it helps us determine the state changes needed for the starting point of the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`ways` is the count of unique pairs where `n` is at least 10 and `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is the next incremented value of `b` (b = b + 1) that satisfies `b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`**
