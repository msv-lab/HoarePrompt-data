According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the value of `a`. The loop iterates over `a` starting from 1 up to `n // 2`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 2, and `a` is currently 1 (the starting value for the loop). For the loop to execute one more time, `a` needs to be increased by 1. Thus, `a` would be 2 in the next iteration and `n` must still be at least 2 to accommodate this value of `a`.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `ways` is the count of unique pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` equals `n/2`, `a` is 2**
