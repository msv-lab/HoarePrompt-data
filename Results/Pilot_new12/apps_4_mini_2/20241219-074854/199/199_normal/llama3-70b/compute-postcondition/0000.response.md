The variable `ways` is initialized to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as the code only affects the variable `ways`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9; `ways` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9; `ways` is 0**.
