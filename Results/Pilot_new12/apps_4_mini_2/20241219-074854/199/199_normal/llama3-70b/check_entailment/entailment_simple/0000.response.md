To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func_1` function and compare it against the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting the distinct ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts, which should be able to form a rectangle but not a square. 

1. **Rectangle Formation**: For a rectangle, we can utilize two pairs of equal lengths, which means we can denote the lengths as `(a, a, b, b)` where `a` and `b` are positive integers.
2. **Non-square Condition**: A square is formed when all four parts are equal, i.e., when `a = b`.

### Function Logic Overview:
1. The function iterates over possible values for `a` (`1` to `n // 2`).
2. For each chosen `a`, it then iterates over possible values for `b` starting from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`.
3. It checks the condition `2 * (a + b) == n`, which implies that both pairs can be formed with the total sum being equal to `n`.
4. It also ensures that `a != b`, which is necessary to prevent forming squares.

### Validity of the Function:
- If `n` is odd or less than `2`, then `ways` will be `0`, which correctly aligns with the problem since we can't split it into the required four distinct parts.
- The ranges chosen for `a` and `b` ensure that we consider only valid pairs while abiding by the constraints of forming a rectangle without resulting in a square configuration.
- Each unique combination of `(a, b)` that meets the criteria is counted correctly.

### Edge Cases:
- If `n < 4`, the output would correctly return `0` since we cannot have four positive parts.
- If `n` is an odd number greater than or equal to `3`, `ways` will still remain `0`, which also aligns with the required conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program successfully implements a method to count the partitions of the stick into four parts as needed by the problem. As such, the program adheres to the outlined requirements. 

Hence, we can conclude the correctness of the program based on the explanation above.

Correctness: **True**
