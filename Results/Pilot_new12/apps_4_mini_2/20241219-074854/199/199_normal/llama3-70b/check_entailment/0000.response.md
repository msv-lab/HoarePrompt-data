To determine the correctness of the provided program for the problem description, let's analyze the conditions under which a stick can be cut into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

The code defines a function `func_1(n)` which counts the valid partitions of the stick:

1. The outer loop iterates over possible lengths `a` for the first and second parts of the rectangle. The restriction to `n // 2 + 1` ensures that `a` is a positive integer.
2. The inner loop iterates over possible lengths `b`, starting from `a`, for the second and third parts. The upper limit is set to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, implying that after choosing `a`, `b` must also be a positive integer that, when doubled and summed with `2 * a`, equals `n`.
3. The `if` condition checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and if the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` holds true.

However, there are potential cases where this program can fail:

- For input `n = 8`, the expected output should be `0` because can be split as `{2, 2, 2, 2}` (which forms a square), and there are no other combinations that provide valid partitions. The code does not account for the fact that producing pairs of identical lengths leading to a square should not be counted.
  
- When `n` is less than `8`, there are no valid configurations since at least `2` of each partition is required to form a rectangle.

This indicates that the code does not correctly handle cases where the total length `n` produces configurations that can form squares (like equal parts).

Correctness: **False**. 

The method does not account for the output being `0` for cases where no valid rectangles can be formed without resulting in a square configuration.
