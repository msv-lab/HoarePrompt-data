The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not accurately account for situations where a stick can be split into parts that form a square. Specifically, when analyzing the input example of `n = 8`, the output should be `0`, as the only way to divide the stick, `{2, 2, 2, 2}`, leads to a square, which doesn't meet the problem's condition of forming rectangles but not squares.

Additionally, the described states in the annotated version confirm the analysis. The function counts pairs `(a, b)` where their sum equals `n / 2`, but it fails to filter out cases leading to squares effectively. Thus, it can return results that do not align with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the logic of the program does indeed fail in cases where equal lengths could lead to squares, making the original assessment accurate. 

Final: **False**
