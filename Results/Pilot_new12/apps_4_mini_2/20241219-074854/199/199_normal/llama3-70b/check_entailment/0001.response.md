To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to break down both the problem description and the solution implemented in the code.

The problem requires finding distinct ways to divide a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. The parts can be combined to form a rectangle.
2. It is impossible to form a square with those parts.
3. Each part must be a positive integer.

To form a rectangle with four parts, we need two pairs of equal lengths. Hence, we can denote the lengths as `a`, `a`, `b`, and `b`, which leads to the equation `2a + 2b = n`, or equivalently `a + b = n / 2`.

### Analyzing the Program

The program provided is as follows:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways
```

1. The outer loop iterates over potential lengths `a` starting from 1 up to `n // 2`.
2. The inner loop iterates over potential lengths `b`, starting from `a` up to the maximum value that keeps the sum valid.
3. The condition `if a != b` ensures that the pairs are distinct.
4. The check `2 * (a + b) == n` validates that the total length of the stick can be achieved with these lengths.

### Edge Case Analysis

1. If `n` is an odd number (e.g., `n = 5`):
   - Since `a + b = n / 2` would not yield an integer solution, and thus the entire program would return 0. This is valid as it respects the problem description; however, an odd length stick can't be cut into four positive integers.

2. If `n` is less than 6 (the smallest split into distinct lengths), for example:
   - For `n = 5`, `n = 4`, or even `n = 3`, the output should rightly be 0 because you cannot create four positive integer lengths whose sum equals `n`.

3. For valid values of `n`:
   - For `n = 6`, the output is 1, and the valid pair is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`.
   - For `n = 20`, valid pairs are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, `{4, 4, 6, 6}`, totaling 4 ways. This checks out correctly based on the description.

### Potential Missing Logic

However, consider an example:
- For `n = 8`, if we explore possible pairs:
  - The pairs `{1, 1, 3, 3}` are valid, while the pairs `{2, 2, 2, 2}` would yield a square, violating the problem's constraints about avoiding squares. The program does not explicitly filter out the pairs that can form squares as we only check if `a != b`, which means that `a = b` cases must not contribute if they do not need to.

### Conclusion

Since the program fails to account for cases which form squares implicitly by allowing `a = b` pairs through the condition not being robust enough against possible square formations (it cannot differentiate fully or exclude out the `{2, 2, 2, 2}` case or any similar for larger n), the program does not meet the problem description's requirement for every possible case.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
