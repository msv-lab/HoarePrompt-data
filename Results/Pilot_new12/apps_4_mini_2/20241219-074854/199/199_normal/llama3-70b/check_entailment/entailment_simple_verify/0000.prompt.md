You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program for the problem description, let's analyze the conditions under which a stick can be cut into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square.

The code defines a function `func_1(n)` which counts the valid partitions of the stick:

1. The outer loop iterates over possible lengths `a` for the first and second parts of the rectangle. The restriction to `n // 2 + 1` ensures that `a` is a positive integer.
2. The inner loop iterates over possible lengths `b`, starting from `a`, for the second and third parts. The upper limit is set to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, implying that after choosing `a`, `b` must also be a positive integer that, when doubled and summed with `2 * a`, equals `n`.
3. The `if` condition checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and if the condition `2 * (a + b) == n` holds true.

However, there are potential cases where this program can fail:

- For input `n = 8`, the expected output should be `0` because can be split as `{2, 2, 2, 2}` (which forms a square), and there are no other combinations that provide valid partitions. The code does not account for the fact that producing pairs of identical lengths leading to a square should not be counted.
  
- When `n` is less than `8`, there are no valid configurations since at least `2` of each partition is required to form a rectangle.

This indicates that the code does not correctly handle cases where the total length `n` produces configurations that can form squares (like equal parts).

Correctness: **False**. 

The method does not account for the output being `0` for cases where no valid rectangles can be formed without resulting in a square configuration.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9; `ways` is the count of unique pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b = n/2` and `a != b`; if `n` is odd or less than `2`, `ways` remains `0`.
    return ways
    #The program returns the count of unique pairs (a, b) where a + b = n/2 and a != b, which is stored in the variable 'ways'. If n is odd or less than 2, 'ways' remains 0.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
