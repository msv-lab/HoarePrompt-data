You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to break down both the problem description and the solution implemented in the code.

The problem requires finding distinct ways to divide a stick of length `n` into four parts such that:
1. The parts can be combined to form a rectangle.
2. It is impossible to form a square with those parts.
3. Each part must be a positive integer.

To form a rectangle with four parts, we need two pairs of equal lengths. Hence, we can denote the lengths as `a`, `a`, `b`, and `b`, which leads to the equation `2a + 2b = n`, or equivalently `a + b = n / 2`.

### Analyzing the Program

The program provided is as follows:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways
```

1. The outer loop iterates over potential lengths `a` starting from 1 up to `n // 2`.
2. The inner loop iterates over potential lengths `b`, starting from `a` up to the maximum value that keeps the sum valid.
3. The condition `if a != b` ensures that the pairs are distinct.
4. The check `2 * (a + b) == n` validates that the total length of the stick can be achieved with these lengths.

### Edge Case Analysis

1. If `n` is an odd number (e.g., `n = 5`):
   - Since `a + b = n / 2` would not yield an integer solution, and thus the entire program would return 0. This is valid as it respects the problem description; however, an odd length stick can't be cut into four positive integers.

2. If `n` is less than 6 (the smallest split into distinct lengths), for example:
   - For `n = 5`, `n = 4`, or even `n = 3`, the output should rightly be 0 because you cannot create four positive integer lengths whose sum equals `n`.

3. For valid values of `n`:
   - For `n = 6`, the output is 1, and the valid pair is `{1, 1, 2, 2}`.
   - For `n = 20`, valid pairs are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, `{4, 4, 6, 6}`, totaling 4 ways. This checks out correctly based on the description.

### Potential Missing Logic

However, consider an example:
- For `n = 8`, if we explore possible pairs:
  - The pairs `{1, 1, 3, 3}` are valid, while the pairs `{2, 2, 2, 2}` would yield a square, violating the problem's constraints about avoiding squares. The program does not explicitly filter out the pairs that can form squares as we only check if `a != b`, which means that `a = b` cases must not contribute if they do not need to.

### Conclusion

Since the program fails to account for cases which form squares implicitly by allowing `a = b` pairs through the condition not being robust enough against possible square formations (it cannot differentiate fully or exclude out the `{2, 2, 2, 2}` case or any similar for larger n), the program does not meet the problem description's requirement for every possible case.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9. It calculates and returns the count of unique pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that `a + b` equals `n / 2` and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `n` is odd or less than 2, the function returns 0, since in those cases, no valid pairs can satisfy the condition. The function does not handle negative values or values of `n` greater than the specified limit, but its logic confines `n` to the stated range.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
