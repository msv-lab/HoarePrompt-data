Based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the python program, I perform a thorough analysis as follows:

1. **Problem Description Understanding**:
   - Pasha needs to cut a stick of length `n` into four distinct parts that can form a rectangle, meaning there must be two sets of equal lengths.
   - The challenge includes ensuring that these parts cannot be rearranged to form a square.

2. **Program Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` aims to count the distinct pairs of lengths `(a, b)` where `2a + 2b = n`.
   - It checks combinations, ensuring `a` is less than `b` and uses the condition `if a != b`, which is necessary to ensure that the parts are not equal.

3. **Logic Problems Identified in Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the code returns the number of ways to partition the stick but failed to highlight the potential for including pairs that could form squares. Specifically, pairs where `a` = `b` could yield squares (e.g., `{2, 2, 2, 2}`).
   - The check for ensuring that created pairs don't give square configurations is not sufficiently enforced as the code only ensures that `a != b`. This means that valid combinations that form squares inadvertently may still be counted.

4. **Annotating Insights**:
   - The annotations correctly note that the function returns counts for ways to partition based on pairs of lengths. However, they also reaffirm that the primary logic regarding avoiding squares was not adequately addressed.
   - Thus, the state of the code after the for loop indicates that it counts pairs only under the conditions specified without fully eliminating square formations.

In conclusion, because the code fails to explicitly prevent square formations from being counted (it relies solely on `a != b`), it does not fulfill the requirements as stated in the problem description.

Final: **False**
