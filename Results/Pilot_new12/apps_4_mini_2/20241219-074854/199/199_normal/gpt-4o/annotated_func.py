    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` found such that `a + b + rem / 2 = n / 2`, where `rem` is `n - 2 * (a + b)`, with `a` ranging from 1 to `n // 4` and `rem` must be both even and greater than 0. If there are no valid pairs, `count` remains 0.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of valid pairs (a, b) found such that a + b + rem / 2 = n / 2, where rem is greater than 0 and even, indicating that count reflects the valid pairs found, or it remains 0 if no valid pairs are found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single positive integer parameter `n`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\). It first checks if `n` is less than 6; if so, it returns 0. If `n` is 6 or greater, the function calculates and returns the count of valid pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that the equation \(a + b + \frac{rem}{2} = \frac{n}{2}\) holds, where \(rem\) is defined as \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\). The variable `a` ranges from 1 to \( \frac{n}{4} \). The function also ensures that \(rem\) is both greater than 0 and even during its calculations. If no valid pairs are found, the function will return 0. It does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or handle negative integers, nor does it take input validation measures for values outside the specified range.
