The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so after the increment, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `rem`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8; `count` is 2; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `rem` is equal to `n - 8**
