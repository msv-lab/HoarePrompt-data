The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 0, so after the execution of the code, `count` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `rem` is equal to `n - 4`, and the current value of `rem` is greater than 0 and is an even integer, and the current value of `a` is not equal to `rem // 2.**
