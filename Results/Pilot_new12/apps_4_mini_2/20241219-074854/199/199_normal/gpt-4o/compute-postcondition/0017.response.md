Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8. If `rem` (which is `n - 8`) is greater than 0 and even, then `count` is updated to 2, while `a`, `b`, and `rem` remain unchanged with `a` equal to 2, `b` equal to 2, and `rem` equal to `n - 8. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `a`, `b`, and `rem` remain unchanged.***
