The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a`. Since `a` was initially 2, `b` will also be set to 2. The values of the other variables (`n`, `count`, and `rem`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `count` is 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `rem` is `n - 8`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `count` is 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `rem` is `n - 8`**
