`rem` is assigned the value of `n - 2 * (a + b)`. The values of `a` and `b` are both 2, so the calculation becomes `rem = n - 2 * (2 + 2)`, which simplifies to `rem = n - 8`. The initial value of `rem` is `n - 4`, but after executing the code, it becomes `n - 8`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, the new value of `rem` will be non-negative (specifically, it will be greater than or equal to 0). 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8; `count` is 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `rem` is equal to `n - 8**.
