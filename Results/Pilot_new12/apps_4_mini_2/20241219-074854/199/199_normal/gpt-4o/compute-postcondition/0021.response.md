`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 2, so the new value is 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `rem`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `count` is now 3, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `rem` is `n - 8`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `count` is 3, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `rem` is `n - 8`.**
