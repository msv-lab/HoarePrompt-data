According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `a`, which is iterating from 1 to `n // 4`. The value of `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we first need to check the current value of `a` and how it relates to the loop's end condition (`n // 4`).

1. Since `a` starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `n // 4`, to execute the loop one more time, `a` must be less than `n // 4`.
2. The `n` value is greater than or equal to 8, so the smallest value of `n // 4` when `n = 8` is 2. This means the loop can execute as long as `a` is 1. 
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be incremented by 1. Thus, if after the last iteration `a` was 1, it should now become 2.
4. Finally, we verify that `n // 4` continues to be greater than `a`, ensuring the loop can indeed run again.

Given this analysis, the next state would reflect `a` being one greater than its last value. Therefore, we can summarize the necessary changes to the state as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `count` is 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `rem` is `n - 8`**
