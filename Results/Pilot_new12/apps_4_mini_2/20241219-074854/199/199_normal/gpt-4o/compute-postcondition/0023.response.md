Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `count` is 3, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `rem` is `n - 8` if `rem` is greater than 0 and `rem` is even, and `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. If `rem` is less than or equal to 0 or if `rem` is odd, there is no change in the values of `count`, `a`, `b`, or `rem`.***
