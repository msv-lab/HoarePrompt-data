Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` found such that `a + b + rem / 2 = n / 2`, where `rem` is `n - 2 * (a + b)`, with `a` ranging from 1 to `n // 4` and `rem` must be both even and greater than 0. If there are no valid pairs, `count` remains 0.**
