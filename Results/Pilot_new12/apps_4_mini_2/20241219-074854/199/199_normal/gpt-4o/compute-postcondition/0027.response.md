Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a single positive integer parameter `n`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\). It first checks if `n` is less than 6; if so, it returns 0. If `n` is 6 or greater, the function calculates and returns the count of valid pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that the equation \(a + b + \frac{rem}{2} = \frac{n}{2}\) holds, where \(rem\) is defined as \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\). The variable `a` ranges from 1 to \( \frac{n}{4} \). The function also ensures that \(rem\) is both greater than 0 and even during its calculations. If no valid pairs are found, the function will return 0. It does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or handle negative integers, nor does it take input validation measures for values outside the specified range.**
