According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a` and the upper limit defined by `n // 4`. The loop executes as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // 4`.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, hence `n // 4` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` needs to increment.

Assuming `n` to be as low as 6, we have:
- `n // 4` = 1.5, which rounds down to 1 due to integer division. 
Given that the loop can run while `a` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, when `a` becomes 2, the condition will no longer be satisfied for `n` equal to 6.

However, since `n` can be any larger integer, we need to ensure that `n` allows `a` to be incremented from 1 to 2.

Since `a` starts at 1, for the loop to execute again, it will become `2` at the start of the next iteration, while `n` still must allow `n // 4` to be at least 2, which means `n` must be at least 8. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must also be adjusted to ensure it's at least 8.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `count` is 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, and `rem` is equal to `n - 4`**
