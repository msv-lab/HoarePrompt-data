The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a`. Since `a` is 2, `b` will also become 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `count`, `rem`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `count` is 1, `a` is 2, `b` is now 2, and `rem` is equal to `n - 4`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `count` is 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `rem` is equal to `n - 4**.
