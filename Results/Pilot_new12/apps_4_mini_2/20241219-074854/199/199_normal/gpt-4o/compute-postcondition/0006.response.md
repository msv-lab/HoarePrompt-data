The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `n - 2 * (a + b)`. Given that `a` is 1 and `b` is 1, we can calculate `a + b` which equals 2. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `n - 2 * 2`, or `n - 4`. Since `n` is a positive integer that is at least 6, `rem` will always be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 (as 6 - 4 = 2).

The states of the other variables (`n`, `count`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and `rem` is equal to `n - 4`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and `rem` is equal to `n - 4**.
