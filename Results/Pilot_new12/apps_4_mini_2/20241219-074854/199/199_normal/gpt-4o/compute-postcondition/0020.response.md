The code assigns the value of `rem` to `n - 2 * (a + b)`. Given that `a` and `b` are both 2, we can calculate `a + b` as 4. Thus, `2 * (a + b)` becomes `2 * 4`, which equals 8. 

Since `rem` will now equal `n - 8`, we can conclude that `rem` is dependent on the value of `n`, which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8. The new value of `rem` will be `n - 8`. 

The states of the other variables `n`, `count`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `count` is 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `rem` is `n - 8`.**
