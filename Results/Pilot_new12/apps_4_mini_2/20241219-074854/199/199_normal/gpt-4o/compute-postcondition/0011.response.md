Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and `rem` is equal to `n - 4`. If `rem` is an even integer greater than 0 and `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, `count` is set to 1. There is no alternative behavior since there is no else part in the code.***
