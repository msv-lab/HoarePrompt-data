The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a`, and since `a` starts at 1, `b` takes on the value of 1. The values of the other variables (`n` and `count`) are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, and `b` is equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0, `a` is 1, and `b` is 1.**
