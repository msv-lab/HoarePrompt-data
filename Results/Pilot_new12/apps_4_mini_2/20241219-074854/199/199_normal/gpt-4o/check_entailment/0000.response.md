To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the program logic against the requirements.

The problem requires splitting a stick of length `n` into four positive parts such that:
- The parts can form a rectangle (which means there should be two pairs of equal lengths).
- The parts cannot form a square (which means all four lengths cannot be the same).

The output should count the distinct ways to achieve this.

### Program Analysis
```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count
```

1. **Base Condition**: 
   - The function correctly handles cases where `n < 6` by returning 0, since it is impossible to split a length less than 6 into four positive integers.

2. **Iteration Logic**:
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n // 4 + 1`, which means it considers possible length `a` for the pairs (`a`, `a`) while assuming `b` also equals `a`.

3. **Remaining Length Calculation**:
   - The remaining length is calculated as `rem = n - 2 * (a + b)`. Given `b = a`, this simplifies to `rem = n - 4 * a`.

4. **Forming Rectangle Condition**:
   - To ensure that the remaining length can be split into two equal parts, it checks for `rem > 0` and `rem % 2 == 0`. However, this only provides for rectangles formed by lengths of `a` and `rem // 2`.

5. **Square Condition**:
   - It checks that `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, which effectively prevents constructing a square.

### Missing Edge Cases
Checking the edge case where `n` is specifically very low (like `6`):
- For `n = 6`, the function allows for a rectangle split of `{1, 1, 2, 2}`, which is valid.
- However, it does not account for all derivations of pairs. For instance, if you consider `n = 8`, the program would fail because valid configurations such as `{1, 1, 3, 3}` will not be counted.

In conclusion, since valid combinations may be missed due to the limitations in the logic used to calculate the `rem`, the program is not correctly fulfilling the requirements laid out in the problem statement. 

Correctness: **False**.
