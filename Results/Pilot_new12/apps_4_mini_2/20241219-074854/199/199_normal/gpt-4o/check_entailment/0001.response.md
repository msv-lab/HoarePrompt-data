Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to count the number of distinct ways to cut a stick of length `n` into four parts such that it can form a rectangle but not a square. 

Upon examining the logic, we see a flaw in the implementation. Specifically:

1. The loop iterates through all values of `a`, which represents one length of the rectangle, and it assumes `b` is equal to `a`. This means it only considers rectangles where two sides are of equal length and does not account for the cases where the two pairs of sides are of different lengths (e.g., forming a rectangle with segments of lengths {1, 2, 1, 2}).
  
2. It correctly checks if `rem` (remaining length) is positive and even, however, the condition `if a != rem // 2` does not ensure that the lengths can actually form a rectangle depending on the counts of each side. A rectangle can be formed using lengths like {a, a, b, b} as long as `a` and `b` are different.

3. It also fails to account for sums that result in squares or where all four segments result in equal lengths, which the problem description states should not be included.

For instance, consider `n = 10`, which should yield valid partitions such as {2, 2, 3, 3} forming a rectangle but not a square. The function would miss accounting for such cases because of its logic.

Therefore, due to these issues in handling different cases properly, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described.
