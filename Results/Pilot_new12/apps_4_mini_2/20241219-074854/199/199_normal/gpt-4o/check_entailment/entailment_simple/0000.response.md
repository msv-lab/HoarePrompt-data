To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program according to the problem description, let's break down both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements
1. We have a positive integer n representing the length of Pasha's stick.
2. We need to split this stick into four positive integer parts such that:
   - It's possible to form a rectangle from these four parts.
   - It is impossible to form a square.
3. Two distinct arrangements are considered different if they differ in the number of parts of any particular length.

To form a rectangle, we need two pairs of equal lengths. To avoid forming a square, the two pairs must be of different lengths.

### Analysis of the Program
1. The program first checks if \( n < 6 \). If so, it returns 0. This is correct since we cannot form four positive parts from a length of less than 6.
2. A loop runs from \( a = 1 \) to \( n // 4 \):
   - For each \( a \), it sets \( b = a \) and calculates the remaining length \( rem = n - 2(a + b) \).
   - It checks if:
     - \( rem > 0 \) (ensures we have enough length left to create the rectangle),
     - \( rem \) is even (since \( rem \) must be split into two equal parts).
   - It then checks if the half of the remaining length (which would form the other pair of the rectangle) is not equal to \( a \) (to prevent forming a square).

### Logical Flow of the Program
- The algorithm effectively counts pairs \( (a, b) \) where \( a = b \) which allows forming two pairs that are equal while ensuring that the splitting also holds to the constraints of not forming a square.
- The counting mechanism is correct because it increments the count only when all conditions are satisfied.

### Edge Cases
- If \( n = 6 \), there is one valid configuration: {1, 1, 2, 2}.
- The algorithm correctly covers other cases like \( n = 8, 10, 12, ..., 20 \) leading to valid configurations as prescribed.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to count the ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square, matching every detail of the problem description. Thus, it handles the constraints placed on scheduling.

Correctness: **True**
