You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the program logic against the requirements.

The problem requires splitting a stick of length `n` into four positive parts such that:
- The parts can form a rectangle (which means there should be two pairs of equal lengths).
- The parts cannot form a square (which means all four lengths cannot be the same).

The output should count the distinct ways to achieve this.

### Program Analysis
```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
    return count
```

1. **Base Condition**: 
   - The function correctly handles cases where `n < 6` by returning 0, since it is impossible to split a length less than 6 into four positive integers.

2. **Iteration Logic**:
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n // 4 + 1`, which means it considers possible length `a` for the pairs (`a`, `a`) while assuming `b` also equals `a`.

3. **Remaining Length Calculation**:
   - The remaining length is calculated as `rem = n - 2 * (a + b)`. Given `b = a`, this simplifies to `rem = n - 4 * a`.

4. **Forming Rectangle Condition**:
   - To ensure that the remaining length can be split into two equal parts, it checks for `rem > 0` and `rem % 2 == 0`. However, this only provides for rectangles formed by lengths of `a` and `rem // 2`.

5. **Square Condition**:
   - It checks that `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, which effectively prevents constructing a square.

### Missing Edge Cases
Checking the edge case where `n` is specifically very low (like `6`):
- For `n = 6`, the function allows for a rectangle split of `{1, 1, 2, 2}`, which is valid.
- However, it does not account for all derivations of pairs. For instance, if you consider `n = 8`, the program would fail because valid configurations such as `{1, 1, 3, 3}` will not be counted.

In conclusion, since valid combinations may be missed due to the limitations in the logic used to calculate the `rem`, the program is not correctly fulfilling the requirements laid out in the problem statement. 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 6) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, and n is greater than or equal to 6
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            if a != rem // 2:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` found such that `a + b + rem / 2 = n / 2`, where `rem` is `n - 2 * (a + b)`, with `a` ranging from 1 to `n // 4` and `rem` must be both even and greater than 0. If there are no valid pairs, `count` remains 0.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of valid pairs (a, b) found such that a + b + rem / 2 = n / 2, where rem is greater than 0 and even, indicating that count reflects the valid pairs found, or it remains 0 if no valid pairs are found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single positive integer parameter `n`, where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\). It first checks if `n` is less than 6; if so, it returns 0. If `n` is 6 or greater, the function calculates and returns the count of valid pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that the equation \(a + b + \frac{rem}{2} = \frac{n}{2}\) holds, where \(rem\) is defined as \(n - 2 \cdot (a + b)\). The variable `a` ranges from 1 to \( \frac{n}{4} \). The function also ensures that \(rem\) is both greater than 0 and even during its calculations. If no valid pairs are found, the function will return 0. It does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or handle negative integers, nor does it take input validation measures for values outside the specified range.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
