Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts to form a rectangle that cannot also form a square. The logic checks if `rem` is greater than 0 and even, which is not sufficient for correctly identifying valid combinations of parts.

For instance, consider `n = 10`. The valid divisions into two pairs of equal lengths are `{1, 1, 4, 4}` and `{2, 2, 3, 3}`. The program logic would incorrectly imply there are no cases where the criteria described in the problem statement are met. The loop calculations and checks do not cover all potential combinations and wrongly count valid `rem` values.

Additionally, the formula used for adjusting values does not accommodate all cases wherein the stick can be split into four integer parts given the parameters. This makes the result unreliable across various inputs, thus highlighting the program's incorrectness for many potential cases.
