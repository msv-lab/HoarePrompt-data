To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it correctly counts the number of distinct ways to split a given stick of length `n` into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. 

The key requirements from the problem description are:
1. The stick must be split into four positive integer lengths.
2. It should be possible to form a rectangle from the parts.
3. It should be impossible to form a square from the parts.

From the problem description, we identify that in order to form a rectangle, the parts must consist of two pairs of equal lengths (e.g., `(a, a, b, b)`). To avoid forming a square, we cannot have all four parts equal, which specifically means we cannot have all parts being the same length (i.e., `a` cannot equal `b`).

Now, looking at the annotated function `func_1(n)`:

1. **Checking the length of the stick**: The function first checks if `n` is less than 6. If `n` is less than 6, it correctly returns 0 since it's impossible to split a stick shorter than 6 into four positive integer parts.

2. **Counting valid pairs**: The core logic inside the `for` loop iterates over possible values of `a` (1 to `n // 4`). For each `a`, it sets `b` equal to `a`, and calculates `rem` as the remaining length that needs to be split into two equal parts (i.e., the length that remains after accounting for `a` and `b`).

3. **Checking conditions**: It checks if `rem` is greater than 0 and even, which is crucial because in order to split `rem` equally, it must be even. Then it checks if `a` does not equal `rem // 2` to ensure that we don’t have a square.

4. **Incrementing the count**: If all conditions are satisfied, it increments the count.

Now, let’s consider if the program appropriately counts the pairs:
- The loop runs for each `a` from 1 to `n // 4`, ensuring both pairs (i.e., `a, a` and `b, b`) can only be made when `n` allows for such divisions. 
- By ensuring `a` and `rem // 2` are different, it avoids counting configurations that would result in a square.
- The return value `count` will reflect the number of valid configurations.

### Conclusion
The provided function does correctly meet the problem requirements. It counts distinct valid configurations of the stick into parts that form a rectangle without forming a square.

Thus, the final determination of correctness is:
Correctness: **True**
