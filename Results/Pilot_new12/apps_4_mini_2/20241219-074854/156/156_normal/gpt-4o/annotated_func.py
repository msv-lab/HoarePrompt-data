#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are even integers greater than or equal to 2, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2. If `full_rows` is an even integer, then `row` is an even integer equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. Otherwise, if `full_rows` is an odd integer, then `row` is an odd integer equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m. If `k < n - 1`, then `k + 1` is printed along with `1`. Otherwise, if `full_rows` is even, `row` is an even integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`; if `full_rows` is odd, `row` is an odd integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps.`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are even integers greater than or equal to 2, and a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 ≤ k < n * m. The function determines coordinates in a grid based on the value of `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it calculates the number of full rows and remaining steps within those rows. Depending on whether the number of full rows is odd or even, it calculates `row` and `col` accordingly. The function ultimately prints either the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)` or `(row, col)` based on the calculations, ensuring that the printed coordinates adhere to the constraints of the given integers. It does not return any values; it performs output operations only. Additionally, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `k` might be equal to or exceed `n * m`, which should be noted as a potential edge case.
