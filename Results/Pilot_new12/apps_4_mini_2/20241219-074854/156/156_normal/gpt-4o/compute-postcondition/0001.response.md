The code `print(k + 1, 1)` will print the values of `k + 1` and `1`. The variable `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n - 1`, and since `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, we know that `k + 1` will be a positive integer.

The other variables `n`, `m`, and any remaining precondition still hold true as their values are not modified by the print statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m and k < n - 1, k + 1 is a positive integer, and `1` is printed along with it.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m and k < n - 1; `k + 1` is a positive integer; printed values are `k + 1` and `1`.**
