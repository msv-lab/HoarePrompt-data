To determine the output state after running the provided code, we analyze the implications of the code snippet on the initial state.

1. The variables `row` and `col` are not directly assigned new values in the provided code but depend on the values of `full_rows`, `n`, `m`, and `remaining_steps`. Thus, before evaluating `print(row, col)`, we must understand the situation of `full_rows`.
   
2. If `full_rows` is even (act 1):
   - `row` becomes `n - full_rows`, which is an even integer, as both `n` and `full_rows` are even integers.
   - `col` would be `2 + remaining_steps`. The value of `remaining_steps` is unspecified, so `col` remains linked to it.

3. If `full_rows` is odd (act 2):
   - `row` becomes `n - full_rows`, which would yield an odd integer since `n` is even and `full_rows` is odd.
   - `col` becomes `m - remaining_steps`, remaining unspecified based on the value of `remaining_steps`.

However, neither of these conditions concludes in a definitive outcome for `row` and `col` due to the unknown variable `remaining_steps`.

Thus, the output needs to express the dependency of `row` and `col` upon the evaluated conditions, while retaining the overall framework defined by the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2; if `full_rows` is even, then `row` is an even integer equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`; if `full_rows` is odd, then `row` is an odd integer equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps.**
