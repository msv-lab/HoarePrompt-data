Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are even integers greater than or equal to 2, and a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 â‰¤ k < n * m. The function determines coordinates in a grid based on the value of `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it calculates the number of full rows and remaining steps within those rows. Depending on whether the number of full rows is odd or even, it calculates `row` and `col` accordingly. The function ultimately prints either the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)` or `(row, col)` based on the calculations, ensuring that the printed coordinates adhere to the constraints of the given integers. It does not return any values; it performs output operations only. Additionally, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `k` might be equal to or exceed `n * m`, which should be noted as a potential edge case.**
