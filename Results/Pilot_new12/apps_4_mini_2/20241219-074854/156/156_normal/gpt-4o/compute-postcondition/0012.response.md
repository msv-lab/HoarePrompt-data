Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2. If `full_rows` is an even integer, then `row` is an even integer equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. Otherwise, if `full_rows` is an odd integer, then `row` is an odd integer equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.***
