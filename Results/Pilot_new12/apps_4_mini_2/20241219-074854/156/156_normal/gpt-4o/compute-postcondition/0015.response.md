The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Both `n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2. The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\). 

The output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot conclude the specific return values or conditions. However, since `n` and `m` are even integers and `k` falls within the stipulated range, it can be inferred that the function likely performs some operation based on these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m which are even integers greater than or equal to 2, and a non-negative integer k such that 0 â‰¤ k < n * m.**
