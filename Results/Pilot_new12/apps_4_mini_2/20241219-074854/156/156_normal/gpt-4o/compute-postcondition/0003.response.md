The value of `k` is decremented by `n - 1`. Given that `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `n - 1` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the new value of `k` becomes `k - (n - 1)`. The constraints ensure that `k` remains non-negative after this operation. The states of the other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1)` where `0 â‰¤ k < n * m` and `k` is non-negative.**
