The value of `full_rows` is assigned the result of `k // (m - 1)`. With `k` being non-negative and `n` and `m` being even integers greater than or equal to 2, it follows that `m - 1` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1). The division operation results in `full_rows` being an integer value which provides the number of full rows based on the available items, represented by `k`, divided by the maximum capacity of each row, `m - 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2; `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`**.
