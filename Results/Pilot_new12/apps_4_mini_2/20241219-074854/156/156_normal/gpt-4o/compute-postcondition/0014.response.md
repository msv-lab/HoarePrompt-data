Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ k < n * m. If `k < n - 1`, then `k + 1` is printed along with `1`. Otherwise, if `full_rows` is even, `row` is an even integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`; if `full_rows` is odd, `row` is an odd integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps.`***
