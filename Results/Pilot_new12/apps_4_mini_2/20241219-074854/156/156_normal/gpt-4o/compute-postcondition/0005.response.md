The value of `remaining_steps` is assigned the result of `k % (m - 1)`. Given that `k` has been updated to `k - (n - 1)` and `m` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `m - 1` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 1. The value of `remaining_steps` will depend on the values of `k` and `m`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2; `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1)`; `full_rows` is equal to `k // (m - 1)`; `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`.**
