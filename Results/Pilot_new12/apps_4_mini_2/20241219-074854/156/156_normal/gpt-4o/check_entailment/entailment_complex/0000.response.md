Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Input Validity**: The function takes three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, ensuring that `n` is always even and both `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 2. The program also ensures that `0 ≤ k < n * m`, thus preventing any out-of-bounds access.

2. **Movement Logic**: 
   - If `k < n - 1`, the program calculates that Lara is still in the first column and directly returns her position as `(k + 1, 1)`, which corresponds to moving down in the first column until reaching the `k+1`-th row.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it indicates Lara has fully descended the first column. The program then recalculates the remaining moves.

3. **Full Rows Calculation**: 
   - Lara's movement pattern switches between columns after completing a full column of movements (first down, then snake-like move). The computation of `full_rows` with `k // (m - 1)` effectively counts how many full horizontal rows she has navigated after moving down the first column.
   - The use of `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)` allows the program to determine how many additional steps she takes in the next row.

4. **Row and Column Determination**:
   - The evenness and oddness of `full_rows` dictate whether Lara’s current row and column increment up (to the right) or decrement (to the left). For an even `full_rows`, she moves right starting from column 2, and for an odd `full_rows`, she moves left from column `m`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program covers all values of `k`, starting from zero (beginning at cell `(1, 1)`) up to the maximum allowed (just under `n * m`), ensuring that it correctly computes positions throughout her journey in the dungeon.

6. **Output**: The function correctly prints the computed row and column according to the specified paths, thus producing accurate results regardless of where `k` falls in its defined range.

Overall, the logic and calculations performed within the function are consistent with the expected behavior outlined in the problem, ensuring that Lara’s position is correctly determined based on the number of moves she has made. Therefore, the program is correct.
