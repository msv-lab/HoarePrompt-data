To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we analyze the problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: The input consists of three integers: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), and `k` (number of moves).
2. **Movement Pattern**:
   - Lara starts at (1, 1).
   - Moves down to (n, 1).
   - Then performs a snake-like movement:
     - For odd numbered rows from the bottom going upwards, she moves right.
     - For even numbered rows from the bottom going upwards, she moves left.
3. **Output**: The output should be Lara's coordinates after `k` moves.

### Code Analysis
The code first checks if `k < n - 1`. If true, it means Lara would still be on the first column and simply prints the respective coordinates based on the moves made downwards.

Otherwise, it calculates how many complete rows she has traversed after the downward path:
- It deducts the downward moves (n - 1) from `k`.
- Then it calculates how many complete rows of snake-like moves have been completed and how many remaining steps in the current row.

In the snake-like movement calculation:
- If the row index (after calculating how many full rows have been traversed) is even, she moves right.
- If the row index is odd, she moves left.

### Edge Cases
1. **Case when `k=0`**: Should correctly return (1, 1).
2. **Case when `k=n*m - 1`** (just one move left before a full traversal): 
   - Currently in cell (1, 2) which is expected to be identified as `k` usages before the end.
  
3. **Maximum bounds**: Even with maximum `n` and `m` (i.e., both being 10^9), we are only accumulating moves and calculating positions without actual iterative loops, which should hold in terms of performance.

### Potential Issue
Upon inspection, there is a critical flaw:
- The code assumes that the remaining steps after determining the full rows are positioned correctly based on the `full_rows` being counted from 0. When checking for even or odd rows, the logic could potentially mismatch the expected coordinates.

For example:
- For `n=4, m=3, k=7`, `full_rows` computed might yield unexpected coordinates since the first move after downward movement should correctly push the coordinates if theyâ€™re being printed from 0-index perspective instead of 1-index which counts from the movement perspective.

Let's confirm:
- For `k=1` (after the first move from (1,1)), position should be (2,1).
- For `k=7` as tested above should yield (3,2) but there may be miscalculations where rows are concerned due to the odd-even check mismatch which could misalign the expected snake movement.

### Conclusion
The correctness of the program is at risk of miscalculating expected coordinates due to the mechanism of turning onto the next row and how it translates into the final coordinates based on the rows traversed and remaining steps.

**Correctness: False**

The program does not handle the boundary cases and could fail for inputs where it makes assumptions about the index alignment (odd/even logic mixed with moves). This indicates incomplete coverage of the movement logic across all potential values of `k`.
