You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we analyze the problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: The input consists of three integers: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), and `k` (number of moves).
2. **Movement Pattern**:
   - Lara starts at (1, 1).
   - Moves down to (n, 1).
   - Then performs a snake-like movement:
     - For odd numbered rows from the bottom going upwards, she moves right.
     - For even numbered rows from the bottom going upwards, she moves left.
3. **Output**: The output should be Lara's coordinates after `k` moves.

### Code Analysis
The code first checks if `k < n - 1`. If true, it means Lara would still be on the first column and simply prints the respective coordinates based on the moves made downwards.

Otherwise, it calculates how many complete rows she has traversed after the downward path:
- It deducts the downward moves (n - 1) from `k`.
- Then it calculates how many complete rows of snake-like moves have been completed and how many remaining steps in the current row.

In the snake-like movement calculation:
- If the row index (after calculating how many full rows have been traversed) is even, she moves right.
- If the row index is odd, she moves left.

### Edge Cases
1. **Case when `k=0`**: Should correctly return (1, 1).
2. **Case when `k=n*m - 1`** (just one move left before a full traversal): 
   - Currently in cell (1, 2) which is expected to be identified as `k` usages before the end.
  
3. **Maximum bounds**: Even with maximum `n` and `m` (i.e., both being 10^9), we are only accumulating moves and calculating positions without actual iterative loops, which should hold in terms of performance.

### Potential Issue
Upon inspection, there is a critical flaw:
- The code assumes that the remaining steps after determining the full rows are positioned correctly based on the `full_rows` being counted from 0. When checking for even or odd rows, the logic could potentially mismatch the expected coordinates.

For example:
- For `n=4, m=3, k=7`, `full_rows` computed might yield unexpected coordinates since the first move after downward movement should correctly push the coordinates if they’re being printed from 0-index perspective instead of 1-index which counts from the movement perspective.

Let's confirm:
- For `k=1` (after the first move from (1,1)), position should be (2,1).
- For `k=7` as tested above should yield (3,2) but there may be miscalculations where rows are concerned due to the odd-even check mismatch which could misalign the expected snake movement.

### Conclusion
The correctness of the program is at risk of miscalculating expected coordinates due to the mechanism of turning onto the next row and how it translates into the final coordinates based on the rows traversed and remaining steps.

**Correctness: False**

The program does not handle the boundary cases and could fail for inputs where it makes assumptions about the index alignment (odd/even logic mixed with moves). This indicates incomplete coverage of the movement logic across all potential values of `k`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are even integers greater than or equal to 2, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if (full_rows % 2 == 0) :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else :
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2. If `full_rows` is an even integer, then `row` is an even integer equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`. Otherwise, if `full_rows` is an odd integer, then `row` is an odd integer equal to `n - full_rows`, and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps`.
        print(row, col)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are even integers greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n * m. If `k < n - 1`, then `k + 1` is printed along with `1`. Otherwise, if `full_rows` is even, `row` is an even integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`; if `full_rows` is odd, `row` is an odd integer equal to `n - full_rows` and `col` is equal to `m - remaining_steps.`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are even integers greater than or equal to 2, and a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 ≤ k < n * m. The function determines coordinates in a grid based on the value of `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it calculates the number of full rows and remaining steps within those rows. Depending on whether the number of full rows is odd or even, it calculates `row` and `col` accordingly. The function ultimately prints either the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)` or `(row, col)` based on the calculations, ensuring that the printed coordinates adhere to the constraints of the given integers. It does not return any values; it performs output operations only. Additionally, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `k` might be equal to or exceed `n * m`, which should be noted as a potential edge case.
