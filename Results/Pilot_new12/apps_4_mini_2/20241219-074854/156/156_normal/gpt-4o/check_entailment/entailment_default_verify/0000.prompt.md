You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
(n, m, k) = (int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
func_1(n, m, k)

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        full_rows = k // (m - 1)
        remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)
        if full_rows % 2 == 0:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = 2 + remaining_steps
        else:
            row = n - full_rows
            col = m - remaining_steps
        print(row, col)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the `func_1` function. This function aims to find Lara's current position after moving `k` times in a rectangular matrix representing the dungeon.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Initial Handling of Moves**:
    - The first condition checks if `k < n - 1`. If true, it outputs `(k + 1, 1)`, which represents moving down the first column until reaching row `k + 1`. This is correct as Lara starts at `(1, 1)` and can move directly to the first column without deviation.

2. **Full Rows and Remaining Steps**:
    - If `k` is equal to or greater than `n - 1`, the algorithm subtracts `n - 1` from `k`, calculating how many moves have been made after reaching the bottom of the first column.
    - The number of full "snake pattern" rows traversed is calculated by `k // (m - 1)`, and the remaining steps are `k % (m - 1)`.
    
3. **Detecting the Direction of Move**:
    - The logic determines whether the current full row count is even or odd to decide the direction. 
        - If even, Lara moves right from the leftmost column.
        - If odd, she moves left from the rightmost column.

4. **Row Calculation**:
    - The row is determined as `n - full_rows`, which seems correct given that Lara starts from the bottom and goes up.

5. **Column Calculation**:
    - The column in the even case is calculated as `2 + remaining_steps`, and in the odd case, it is calculated as `m - remaining_steps`. 

### Potential Test Cases

Let us analyze a case where the numbers behave unexpectedly. 

Consider an edge case:
- **Input**: `n = 2, m = 2, k = 1`
  - Expected Output: `(2, 1)` (she should move to `(2, 1)` after 1 move).
  - Current Calculation Logic:
    - With `k = 1`, the condition `k < n - 1` returns true (1 < 1 is false). Thus it skips to the else block. However, the calculation for rows and columns would be incorrect because Lara is still moving into the second row but doesn't properly address this straightforward movement.

In this case, the function miscalculates positions because it assumes that when `k` values barely fit into the predefined row and column logic. 

### Conclusion

Even though the main logic appears sound, it has flawed edge case handling where it does not accurately assign positions when moving in a compact configuration, particularly when sliding from one row to the next. 

Therefore, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are even integers greater than or equal to 2, and a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 ≤ k < n * m. The function determines coordinates in a grid based on the value of `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it calculates the number of full rows and remaining steps within those rows. Depending on whether the number of full rows is odd or even, it calculates `row` and `col` accordingly. The function ultimately prints either the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)` or `(row, col)` based on the calculations, ensuring that the printed coordinates adhere to the constraints of the given integers. It does not return any values; it performs output operations only. Additionally, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `k` might be equal to or exceed `n * m`, which should be noted as a potential edge case.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
