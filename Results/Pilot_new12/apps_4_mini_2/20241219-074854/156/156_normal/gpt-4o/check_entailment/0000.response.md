To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the `func_1` function. This function aims to find Lara's current position after moving `k` times in a rectangular matrix representing the dungeon.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Initial Handling of Moves**:
    - The first condition checks if `k < n - 1`. If true, it outputs `(k + 1, 1)`, which represents moving down the first column until reaching row `k + 1`. This is correct as Lara starts at `(1, 1)` and can move directly to the first column without deviation.

2. **Full Rows and Remaining Steps**:
    - If `k` is equal to or greater than `n - 1`, the algorithm subtracts `n - 1` from `k`, calculating how many moves have been made after reaching the bottom of the first column.
    - The number of full "snake pattern" rows traversed is calculated by `k // (m - 1)`, and the remaining steps are `k % (m - 1)`.
    
3. **Detecting the Direction of Move**:
    - The logic determines whether the current full row count is even or odd to decide the direction. 
        - If even, Lara moves right from the leftmost column.
        - If odd, she moves left from the rightmost column.

4. **Row Calculation**:
    - The row is determined as `n - full_rows`, which seems correct given that Lara starts from the bottom and goes up.

5. **Column Calculation**:
    - The column in the even case is calculated as `2 + remaining_steps`, and in the odd case, it is calculated as `m - remaining_steps`. 

### Potential Test Cases

Let us analyze a case where the numbers behave unexpectedly. 

Consider an edge case:
- **Input**: `n = 2, m = 2, k = 1`
  - Expected Output: `(2, 1)` (she should move to `(2, 1)` after 1 move).
  - Current Calculation Logic:
    - With `k = 1`, the condition `k < n - 1` returns true (1 < 1 is false). Thus it skips to the else block. However, the calculation for rows and columns would be incorrect because Lara is still moving into the second row but doesn't properly address this straightforward movement.

In this case, the function miscalculates positions because it assumes that when `k` values barely fit into the predefined row and column logic. 

### Conclusion

Even though the main logic appears sound, it has flawed edge case handling where it does not accurately assign positions when moving in a compact configuration, particularly when sliding from one row to the next. 

Therefore, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
