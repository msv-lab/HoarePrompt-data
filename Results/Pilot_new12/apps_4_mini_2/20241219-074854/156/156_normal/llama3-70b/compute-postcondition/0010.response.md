Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer assigned from input, `m` is an integer assigned from input, and `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` within the bounds `0 <= k < n Â· m` and `2 <= n, m <= 10^9`. If `k < n - 1`, the output values are `(k + 1, 1)`. Otherwise, if `k < n * 2 - 2`, the output values are computed as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the output is 1 and 2.***
