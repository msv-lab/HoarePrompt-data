Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, with `n` being an even integer between 2 and 10^9, and `k` updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)`. If `k < n * 2 - 2`, output values are computed as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, then the output is 1 and 2.***
