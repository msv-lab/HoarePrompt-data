The `print` statement executes the calculation based on the given values of `n` and `k`. Starting with the original conditions:

- `n` is an even integer from input.
- `m` is an integer from input.
- `k` has been updated by `k % (n * 2 - 2)`, with `0 <= k < n * m`.
- It is stated that `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and the current value of `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`.

The calculations in the `print` statement are as follows:

1. The first value to print is calculated as:
   - \( n - (k - n + 1) \mod (n - 1) - 1 \)
   - Since \( k \) is at least \( n - 1 \), the expression \( k - n + 1 \) will be non-negative.
   - The result of the modulus operation will vary between 0 and \( n - 2 \) (since \( n - 1 \geq 1 \)), so the end result for the first part will depend on the specific values of \( k \) and \( n \).

2. The second value to print is calculated as:
   - \( (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1 \)
   - This computes how many full cycles of \( (n - 1) \) fit into the value \( k - n + 1 \).

Thus, the output includes both calculated values derived from `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer from input; `m` is an integer from input; `k` is updated as `k % (n * 2 - 2)`; output values are dependent on specific values of `n` and `k` as computed from the formulae: `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`.**
