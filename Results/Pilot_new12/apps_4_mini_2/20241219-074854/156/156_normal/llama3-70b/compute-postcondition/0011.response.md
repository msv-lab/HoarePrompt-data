The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. `n` is an even integer and falls within the range 2 to 10^9, while `m` is also an integer in the same range. The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n·m. The function performs its operations based on these inputs. 

While the specific output is not detailed in the provided information, we can deduce that it will depend on the relationships and constraints of the parameters. Based on the input constraints and relationships, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `n` and `m` (where `n` is even) and a non-negative integer `k`, and perform computations or evaluations based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` (even) and `m` (both within 2 to 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (0 <= k < n·m).**
