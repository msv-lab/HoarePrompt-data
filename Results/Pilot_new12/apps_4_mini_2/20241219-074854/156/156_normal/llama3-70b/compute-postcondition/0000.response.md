The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are each assigned the integer values from the input. The previous conditions state that `n` is an even integer between 2 and 10^9, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer where `0 <= k < nÂ·m`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is updated to reflect the assignment of `n`, `m`, and `k` based on the input values.

Output State: **`n` is assigned an integer from input, `m` is assigned an integer from input, `k` is assigned an integer from input such that 0 <= k < nÂ·m and 2 <= n, m <= 10^9 and n is an even integer.**
