The provided program accurately implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Let's break down the logic to demonstrate its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, which conforms to the problem constraints: 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is even, 0 ≤ k < n·m.

2. **Calculation of `k`**: The program computes `k % (n * 2 - 2)`, ensuring that `k` is wrapped within the bounds relevant to the movement pattern laid out in the problem description. 

3. **Movement Logic**:
   - If `k < n - 1`, Lara has not yet reached the bottom of the first column, so the output is straightforward: `(k + 1, 1)`. This correctly denotes the position in the first column as she moves downward.
   - If `k` is within the range `[n - 1, n * 2 - 2)`, this indicates Lara's movement is somewhere in the zigzag part of her path:
     - The output `(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)` correctly computes three cases based on modulo and integer division, which represent her snake-like movements to the left and right in subsequent rows after reaching the bottom.
   - If `k` equals or exceeds `n * 2 - 2`, the output `(1, 2)` indicates Lara has completed her movement pattern and is at the top of the second column.

4. **Output Validity**: The algorithm ensures that the output is based on the exact rules defined for the `k` manipulation and respects the matrix boundaries.

The above steps follow the problem description's requirements strictly, validating that Lara's positioning is accurately computed without skipping any potential outcomes based on the allowed values of `k`. Therefore, we can conclude that:

Correctness: **True**
