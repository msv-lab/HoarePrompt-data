You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 10^9 and n is an even integer; k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n·m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers, with `n` being an even integer between 2 and 10^9, and `k` updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)`. If `k < n * 2 - 2`, output values are computed as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, then the output is 1 and 2.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer assigned from input, `m` is an integer assigned from input, and `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)` within the bounds `0 <= k < n · m` and `2 <= n, m <= 10^9`. If `k < n - 1`, the output values are `(k + 1, 1)`. Otherwise, if `k < n * 2 - 2`, the output values are computed as `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the output is 1 and 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `n` (an even integer between 2 and 10^9) and `m` (an integer within the same range), along with a non-negative integer `k` (0 <= k < n·m). It computes a modified value of `k` using modulo arithmetic (`k % (n * 2 - 2)`) and produces different outputs based on the resulting value of `k`. 

Specifically:
- If `k < n - 1`, it outputs the values `(k + 1, 1)`.
- If `n - 1 <= k < n * 2 - 2`, it calculates and outputs `(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)`.
- If `k >= n * 2 - 2`, it outputs `(1, 2)`.

The output consists of two integers and is determined entirely based on the value of `k`, which factors in a wrapping behavior due to the modulo operation. The constraints ensure that the function handles edge cases well, as long as inputs adhere to the specified ranges. The code does not account for invalid input (e.g., inputs outside defined bounds), but given the problem context, it's assumed that inputs will always be valid.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
