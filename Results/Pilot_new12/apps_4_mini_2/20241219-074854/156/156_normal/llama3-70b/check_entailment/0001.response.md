Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains logic errors that can lead to incorrect outputs for some inputs.

1. The `k %= n * 2 - 2` statement seems to be an attempt to wrap around the number of moves Lara can make, but it incorrectly assumes that the path is simple and does not sufficiently account for all the rows and columns in the "snake-like" pattern described.

2. The second condition checks if `k < n * 2 - 2`, but there are additional edge cases that arise once Lara has started moving horizontally. After reaching the end of a column and moving up, the program does not accurately track the correct rows and columns for additional moves beyond this point.

3. If `k` exceeds the bounds of the visible snake-like movement (after traversing through the first column down and then back up), the calculation could wrongly calculate the cell position.

For example, consider the input `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 12`. The expected outcome based on a complete understanding of the snake-like traversal (passing through all cells) should yield the position `(1, 2)` since Lara would have already returned back to that area after finishing the entire traversal. The program, however, attempts to compute the position based solely on the modulo operations, which may result in incorrect coordinates for such higher values of `k`.

Thus, the program fails for cases where `k` represents positions that are at or past the horizontal movements. Hence, it does not accurately meet the problem description in every potential case.
