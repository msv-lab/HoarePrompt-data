The code `print('YES')` displays the string 'YES' to the output but does not modify any variables or state in the program. The initial state remains intact since the values of `n`, `a`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; `x` is 2; `y` is (n - 2 * a) // b; print output is 'YES'**
