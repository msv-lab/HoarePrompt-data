The variable `a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` retrieves an input that is subsequently converted to an integer. The initial state only specifies the bounds for `n`, `a`, and `b`, and since `a` is being assigned a new input value, the only variable affected is `a`. Therefore, the Output State will indicate that `a` now holds an input integer while containing the previous bounds for `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000,000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10,000,000.**
