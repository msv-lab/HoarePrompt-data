The code prints 'YES', confirming that a valid combination of `x` and `y` exists that satisfies the equation `x * a + y * b == n`. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000,000, `a` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, and 'YES' is printed.**
