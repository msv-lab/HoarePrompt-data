The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. Therefore, no variables are modified or reassigned, and the execution ends without any changes to the program's state, aside from the termination itself. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000,000, `a` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, and 'YES' is printed; the program has exited.**
