The `exit()` command terminates the program immediately, so there are no changes to variable values from the given code snippet. The program would stop executing, and as a result, no outputs or further calculations will occur. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; `x` is 2; `y` is (n - 2 * a) // b; output printed is '2' and 'y', and the program execution is terminated.**
