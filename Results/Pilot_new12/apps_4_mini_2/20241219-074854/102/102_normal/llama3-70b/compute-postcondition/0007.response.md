In this case, the values of `x` and `y` are printed out. The value of `x` remains `0` and `y` is computed as `n // b`, but since we do not have the actual value of `n` or `b`, we express `y` in terms of `n` and `b`. Since the print statement does not change the values of any variables, the conditions remain as they are.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000,000, `a` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, and 'YES' is printed.**
