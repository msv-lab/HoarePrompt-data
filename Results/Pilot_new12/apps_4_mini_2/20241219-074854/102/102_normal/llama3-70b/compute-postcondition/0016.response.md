According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1. For the loop to execute once more, `x` needs to be incremented to 2. Additionally, the upper limit for `x` is determined by the expression `n // a + 1`, which allows for the loop to execute as long as `x` is less than this value.

Therefore, the next state must reflect an increment of `x` and confirm that `n` remains within the constraints specified:

State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000,000, `a` is greater than 0, `x` is 2, and `y` is now (n - a) // b.**
