The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates with the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are constrained by the following conditions: `1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000,000`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000`. 

Since the output of the function is not provided, I cannot summarize the output or return value based on the absence of cases or conditions related to `n`, `a`, and `b`. Thus, I cannot fully describe the functionality without additional information regarding the output based on these input parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates within the constraints of integers n, a, and b, returning a result based on their defined relationships.**
