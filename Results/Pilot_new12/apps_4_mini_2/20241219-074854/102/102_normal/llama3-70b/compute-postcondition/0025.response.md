Functionality: **The function reads three integers n, a, and b from input, where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000. It checks whether there exist non-negative integers x and y such that the equation x * a + y * b equals n. If such integers are found during the iteration over possible values of x, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of x and y, then it terminates the program. If no valid pairs (x, y) are found after all possible iterations, it prints 'NO'. The function performs no parameter checks or input validation and does not handle edge cases where inputs may lead to invalid values or types. It strictly relies on inputs to fit within the given constraints.**
