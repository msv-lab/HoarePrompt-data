Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; if there exist non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b == n`, then the program prints 'YES', followed by values of `x` and `y`, and exits; otherwise, `x` is the maximum integer value such that `x * a ≤ n` and `y` is the largest integer satisfying `y = (n - x * a) // b`; printed output is 'NO'.**
