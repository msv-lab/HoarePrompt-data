The code `exit()` terminates the program without changing any variable values. The variables retain their previous states. The output state will reflect that the program is ending.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10,000,000; `a` is greater than 0; `x` is 1; `y` is now (n - a) // b; the program terminates without returning any additional values.**
