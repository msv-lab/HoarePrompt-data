You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

First line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.


-----Output-----

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.

-----Note-----

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways:   buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;  buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;  don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. 

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        if x * a + y * b == n:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program has a potential issue when calculating the number of Bars bars (`y`). Specifically, it assumes that the division `(n - x * a) // b` will always yield a non-negative integer. However, if `n - x * a` is less than zero (i.e., if `x` is too large), this division will yield a negative integer, which is not valid as `y` must be a non-negative integer.

For example, consider the following input:
```
n = 5
a = 3
b = 2
```
In this case, iterating through possible values of `x`, when `x = 1`, the calculation would be:
```
y = (5 - 1 * 3) // 2
y = (5 - 3) // 2
y = 2 // 2
y = 1  (this is valid, output YES with 1 1)
```
But when `x = 2`, it becomes:
```
y = (5 - 2 * 3) // 2
y = (5 - 6) // 2
y = -1 // 2 
```
Here, the program does not handle cases where `n - x * a` is negative, leading to possible invalid scenarios for `y`. The expected output should be "NO" since it is impossible to spend exactly 5 burles in this scenario. 

Thus, there exists a case where the program fails to produce the correct output accordingly; therefore, the correctness is deemed **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads three integers n, a, and b from input, where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000. It checks whether there exist non-negative integers x and y such that the equation x * a + y * b equals n. If such integers are found during the iteration over possible values of x, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of x and y, then it terminates the program. If no valid pairs (x, y) are found after all possible iterations, it prints 'NO'. The function performs no parameter checks or input validation and does not handle edge cases where inputs may lead to invalid values or types. It strictly relies on inputs to fit within the given constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
