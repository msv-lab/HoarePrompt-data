Correctness: **False**.

The given program has a potential issue when calculating the number of Bars bars (`y`). Specifically, it assumes that the division `(n - x * a) // b` will always yield a non-negative integer. However, if `n - x * a` is less than zero (i.e., if `x` is too large), this division will yield a negative integer, which is not valid as `y` must be a non-negative integer.

For example, consider the following input:
```
n = 5
a = 3
b = 2
```
In this case, iterating through possible values of `x`, when `x = 1`, the calculation would be:
```
y = (5 - 1 * 3) // 2
y = (5 - 3) // 2
y = 2 // 2
y = 1  (this is valid, output YES with 1 1)
```
But when `x = 2`, it becomes:
```
y = (5 - 2 * 3) // 2
y = (5 - 6) // 2
y = -1 // 2 
```
Here, the program does not handle cases where `n - x * a` is negative, leading to possible invalid scenarios for `y`. The expected output should be "NO" since it is impossible to spend exactly 5 burles in this scenario. 

Thus, there exists a case where the program fails to produce the correct output accordingly; therefore, the correctness is deemed **False**.
