Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Let's analyze how it meets the requirements:

1. **Inputs**: The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. The problem states that these integers fall within the range \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10,000,000\), which is guaranteed as per the problem description.

2. **Search for Solutions**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through possible non-negative integers `x`, where `x` represents the number of bottles of Ber-Cola that Vasya can buy. It calculates `y` (the number of Bars bars) as the integer division of the remaining money after subtracting the cost of `x` bottles of Ber-Cola. This construction follows the logic of the equation \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\).

3. **Condition Checking**: During each iteration, the program checks whether the equation \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\) holds true. If a valid pair (x, y) is found, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, effectively indicating that it is possible to spend exactly `n` burles.

4. **Output for No Solutions**: If after all iterations no valid pairs are found, the program correctly prints "NO", adhering to the requirement to inform Vasya when it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles.

5. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle edge cases, such as `a` or `b` being greater than `n`, since the loop and conditions would inherently not satisfy the requirements. As we assume valid inputs within specified constraints, the program correctly calculates potential costs for any valid integers within the given constraints.

In summary, the program fulfills all the functional requirements set forth in the problem description. It accurately determines the possibilities based on available money and the costs of the items, thus it can be considered correct.
