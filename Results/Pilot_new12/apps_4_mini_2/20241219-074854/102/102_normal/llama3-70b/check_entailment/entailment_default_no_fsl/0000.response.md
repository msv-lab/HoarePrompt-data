Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible for Vasya to buy a combination of Ber-Cola and Bars bars such that the total cost is exactly `n`. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The program iterates through all possible non-negative integers `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) up to `n // a`. For each value of `x`, it calculates the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles: `n - x * a`.
2. It then calculates the maximum potential number of Bars bars `y` that can be bought with the remaining money: `y = (n - x * a) // b`.
3. The condition `x * a + y * b == n` ensures that the total cost equals exactly `n` for the chosen `x` and computed `y`.
4. If a valid combination is found, it prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`.
5. If no valid pairs `(x, y)` are found after exhausting all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The output hints correctly summarize this logic, and based on the provided example inputs, the program handles each case according to the problem requirements. It checks for all combinations and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description.

Given the correctness of the logic and the alignment with the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct for all valid test cases within the specified limits.
