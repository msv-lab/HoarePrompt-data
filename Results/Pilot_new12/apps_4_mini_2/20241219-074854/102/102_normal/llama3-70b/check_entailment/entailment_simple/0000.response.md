Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input which correspond to:
   - `n`: the total amount of money (burles) Vasya has.
   - `a`: the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.
   - `b`: the cost of one Bars bar.
   This input satisfies the constraints stated in the problem where \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10,000,000\).

2. **Loop through possible values of x**: The program iterates over values of `x` ranging from `0` to `n // a` (inclusive). This means it considers all possible counts of Ber-Cola bottles `x` that Vasya can buy without exceeding his budget.

3. **Calculating y**: For each value of `x`, the program calculates `y` using the formula:
   \[
   y = \frac{n - x \cdot a}{b}
   \]
   This calculates how many Bars bars can be purchased with the remaining money after spending \(x \cdot a\) on Ber-Cola. The integer division is used to ensure that `y` is a non-negative integer.

4. **Condition for exactly spending n**: The program checks if the combination of `x` and `y` meets the condition \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\). If this condition is satisfied, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, indicating that it is possible to purchase the items exactly within the budget.

5. **Final output if no valid (x, y) is found**: If the loop completes without finding any valid pairs, the program will print "NO". This correctly indicates that it is not possible to spend exactly `n` burles using any combination of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars.

6. **Generality of the solution**: The program checks all possible combinations of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars that can be purchased with the given budget, ensuring that all potential non-negative integer solutions are considered.

Since the implemented logic effectively checks all necessary conditions and outputs the correct statements according to the problem's requirements, the program is accurate and adheres to the specifications laid out in the problem description. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
