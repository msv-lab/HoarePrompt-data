The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from user input. It then attempts to determine if there exist non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that the equation `n = x * a + y * b` holds true, where `x` can range from `0` to `n // a`. If such a pair `(x, y)` is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of `x` and `y`. If no such pair is found after exhaustively checking all possible values of `x`, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values and will either print 'YES' with the respective values or 'NO', completing its execution with no values being returned or stored. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no valid (x, y) pairs exist, resulting in only the 'NO' message being printed. Additionally, the function assumes valid integer inputs within the specified range but does not handle any invalid inputs or exceptions that could arise.
