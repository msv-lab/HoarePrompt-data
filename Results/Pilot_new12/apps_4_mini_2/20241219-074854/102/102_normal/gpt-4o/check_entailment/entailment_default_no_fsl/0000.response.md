Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It determines if there exist non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that the equation `n = x * a + y * b` holds true, for given values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Here's a breakdown of how the program functions:

1. The program first reads the integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, which represent the total burles Vasya has, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and the cost of one Bars bar respectively.

2. It then iterates over the possible values of `x` from `0` to `n // a`, where `x` represents the number of bottles of Ber-Cola bought. For each possible value of `x`, it calculates the remaining money (`n - x * a`) and checks if this remaining amount can be perfectly divided by the cost of a Bars bar (`b`). 

3. If a valid `x` is found such that the remaining amount of money can be expressed as `y * b`, it calculates `y` and prints "YES" along with the values of `x` and `y`.

4. If no valid pairs `(x, y)` are found by the end of the loop, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all potential cases as outlined in the problem description, including edge cases such as when `n` is smaller than both `a` and `b`, or when one of the items is unaffordable. All the provided examples are also satisfactorily handled by the current logic of the function.

Additionally, the program adheres to the assumption that input values are valid integers within the specified range (1 to 10,000,000). Therefore, there are no invalid input scenarios that it needs to handle for the correctness assessment at this level.

Since the code fulfills its purpose effectively for every potential case outlined, the assessment concludes that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
