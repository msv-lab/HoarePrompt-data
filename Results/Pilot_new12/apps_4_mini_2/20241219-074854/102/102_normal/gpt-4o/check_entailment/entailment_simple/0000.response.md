To determine if the provided program is correct based on the given problem description, we will analyze the logic of the program against the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Requirements:
The problem requires us to check if it is possible to buy some integer non-negative numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola (cost 'a') and Bars bars (cost 'b') such that the total expenditure exactly matches 'n'. We need to find non-negative integers 'x' and 'y' such that:

\[ x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n \]

If such integers exist, we should return "YES" along with the values of 'x' and 'y'. If they do not exist, we should return "NO".

### Program Logic:
1. The program accepts three input integers: `n` (money Vasya has), `a` (cost of Ber-Cola), and `b` (cost of Bars).
2. It loops over possible values of `x`, from `0` to the maximum number of Ber-Cola bottles Vasya can buy (`n // a`).
3. For each value of `x`, it checks if the remaining amount of money, \( n - x \cdot a \), is divisible by the cost of Bars (`b`). This condition checks whether an integer number of Bars can be bought with the remaining money after purchasing `x` bottles of Ber-Cola.
4. If a valid combination is found, it prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`, where \( y = (n - x \cdot a) / b \).
5. If no valid combinations are found after the loop, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:
- The loop exhaustively considers all possible integer values of `x` up to `n // a`, ensuring that all potential distributions of money are checked.
- For each possible `x`, it accurately calculates the remaining money and checks if it can be completely spent on Bars, determining `y` accordingly.
- The use of modulo operation in `(n - x * a) % b == 0` ensures that only valid cases where `y` is a non-negative integer are accepted.

### Conclusion:
The program effectively implements the required checks outlined in the problem description. It correctly identifies whether it is possible for Vasya to spend exactly `n` burles on the two items, and outputs appropriate results based on the conditions checked.

Thus, the program adheres to the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
