Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here’s why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which align with the constraints specified in the problem description (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000). It assumes that the user provides valid input, which is consistent with the given instructions.

2. **Logic for Finding x and y**: The program uses a for loop to iterate over possible values of `x` from `0` to `n // a`. For each value of `x`, it checks if the remaining amount of money (`n - x * a`) is divisible by `b`. This check is mathematically equivalent to finding a valid `y` such that:

   \[
   y = \frac{n - x \cdot a}{b}
   \]

   This condition maintains the core equation from the problem statement: `n = x * a + y * b`. If the condition holds true, it computes `y` and prints "YES" along with the values of `x` and `y`. 

3. **Exhaustive Search**: The program exhaustively checks all potential values of `x`, ensuring that no valid combinations of `x` and `y` that meet the requirement are missed. If no valid pairs are found after all iterations, it correctly outputs "NO".

4. **Output Specification**: The function outputs exactly the required format specified in the problem description. If a solution exists, it prints "YES" followed by the integers `x` and `y`. If it determines that a solution is not possible, it prints "NO".

5. **Multiple Solutions**: The problem description allows for multiple valid answers. The approach taken by the program accommodates this by checking all possible values of `x` until it finds the first valid solution, which conforms to the requirement of printing any valid (x, y) pair.

Given these points, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description under all specified conditions. There are no hidden cases where it would fail to provide the correct result based on the constraints given. Thus, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
