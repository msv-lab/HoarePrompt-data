Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines if it is possible for Vasya to spend exactly `n` burles by purchasing `x` bottles of Ber-Cola and `y` Bars bars such that the equation `x·a + y·b = n` holds, where `a` is the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola and `b` is the cost of one Bars bar.

Here's an explanation of why the program works correctly for all potential cases:

1. It reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b` to represent the total amount of money Vasya has, the cost of a bottle of Ber-Cola, and the cost of a Bars bar, respectively.

2. It uses a loop to iterate over all possible values of `x`, the number of bottles of Ber-Cola that can be bought. The loop runs from `0` to `n // a`, which is the maximum number of bottles Vasya can purchase given his budget.

3. For each value of `x`, it calculates the remaining amount of money after buying `x` bottles of Ber-Cola with `n - x * a`.

4. The program checks if the remaining money can be exactly divided by `b` (the cost of a Bars bar) using the condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0`. If this condition is satisfied, it means that Vasya can buy a non-negative integer amount of Bars bars (`y = (n - x * a) // b`).

5. If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found during the iteration, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`.

6. If the loop completes without finding any valid pair, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including:
- The case where exactly zero bottles or bars are needed.
- The scenarios where multiple combinations exist by correctly identifying at least one valid combination.

Since there is no possibility of missing any cases, and all requirements from the problem description are met, the program is correct.
