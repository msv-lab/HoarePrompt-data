The program attempts to find non-negative integer solutions \( x \) and \( y \) such that the equation \( n = x \cdot a + y \cdot b \) holds true. It does this by iterating through possible values of \( x \) (from 0 to \( n // a \)) and checking if the remainder when subtracting \( x \cdot a \) from \( n \) is divisible by \( b \). If such a pair is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the values of \( x \) and \( y \), otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The code correctly captures and checks all potential combinations of the integers \( x \) and \( y \) by iterating through the feasible range of \( x \) values. If any valid combination is found within the input constraints, it outputs the result as specified in the problem description.

The output hints are consistent with the logic of the program, which accurately summarizes that the function's goal is to determine valid integer combinations for specific pricing, ensuring it evaluates all possibilities.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Edge Case when \( a \) or \( b \) is greater than \( n \)**: If \( a > n \), then the only feasible solution could be to select \( y \) such that \( b \cdot y = n \). If \( b > n \), then similarly only \( x \) could potentially be used if \( a \cdot x = n \).
2. If both are greater than \( n \), then the logic still holds, and the only possible \( (x, y) \) would be \( (0, 0) \) resulting in \( n = 0 \), where the program would still handle it correctly printing 'NO'.

### Valid Operations
Since all input constraints fall within expected ranges and valid integers are anticipated, the program will successfully determine whether or not it is possible to buy exactly \( n \) burles worth of products.

After conducting a thorough analysis of the implementation against the problem description and given examples, we can conclude that the implementation handles the required conditions correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
