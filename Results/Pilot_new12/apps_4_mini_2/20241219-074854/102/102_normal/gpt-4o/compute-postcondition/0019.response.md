The code outputs the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is already defined as 2. The computation for `y` is given by the expression `(n - 2 * a) // b`. Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to `2 * a`, it ensures that `y` will be a non-negative integer.

Thus, after executing the print statement, `x` remains 2, and `y` is defined based on the relationship with `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an integer; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 * `a`; `x` is 2; `y` is equal to (n - 2 * a) // b; printed values are (2, y).**
