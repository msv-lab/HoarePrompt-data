Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an integer, `n` is a non-negative integer. The loop exhaustively checks all values of `x` from 0 to `n // a`. If `n - x * a` is divisible by `b`, then the program finds `y` as `(n - x * a) // b` and prints 'YES', along with the values of `x` and `y`. If no such `x` satisfies the condition for all iterations, then no values are printed, and the loop completes its execution without a return.**
