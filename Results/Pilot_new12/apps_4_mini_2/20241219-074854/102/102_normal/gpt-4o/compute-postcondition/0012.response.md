The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because this code does not modify any variables. 

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer, `n` must be non-negative, `x` is 1, and `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`, and 'YES' is printed.**
