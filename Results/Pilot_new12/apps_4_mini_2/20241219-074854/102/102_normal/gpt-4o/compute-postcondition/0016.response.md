According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `x`, which will iterate from 0 to `n // a`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1. 

To execute the loop once more, `x` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `x` becomes 2. The maximum value of `x` for the loop to still execute is `n // a`, which must be at least 2 for the loop to continue iterating.

Given that `x` is currently 1, and to execute one additional iteration, `n // a` must be greater than or equal to 2. Hence, `n` must be at least `2 * a` for the loop to execute once more.

State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 * `a`, and `x` is 2.**
