Since the code assigns an input value to `n`, the value of `n` will be impacted by the input. However, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged and unspecified. The output state reflects that `n` has been updated based on user input.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000; `n` is an input integer.**
