The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It contains three distinct cases regarding its output: 

- Case 1: The function returns `None`, as no value is specified for return.
- Case 2: The function does not return any value, as the return statement is empty. However, it prints "YES" along with the values of `x` (which is always 1) and `y` (calculated as (n - a) // b).
- Case 3: Similar to Case 1, the function returns nothing as there is no value or variable being returned.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept no parameters and produce output either as `None`, print statements, or nothing based on the execution path, but it does not yield a typical return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and may return None, print specific messages, or return nothing based on the internal conditions.**
