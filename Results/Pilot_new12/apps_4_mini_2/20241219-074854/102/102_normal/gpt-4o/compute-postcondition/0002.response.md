The variable `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous bounds of `b` are 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer.**
