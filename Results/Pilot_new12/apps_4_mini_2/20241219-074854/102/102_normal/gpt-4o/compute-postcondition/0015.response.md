Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an integer, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is 1. If `(n - x * a) % b` equals 0, the program prints 'YES', and the values of `x` (which is 1) and `y` (which is equal to `(n - a) // b`) are printed. If the condition does not hold, the program does not return any value and completes without further action.***
