The code `print('YES')` produces a print output of the string 'YES'. It does not change the values of any of the internal variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `y`). Therefore, the state of the program variable values remains unaltered.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an integer; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 * `a`; `x` is 2; `y` is equal to (n - 2 * a) // b.**
