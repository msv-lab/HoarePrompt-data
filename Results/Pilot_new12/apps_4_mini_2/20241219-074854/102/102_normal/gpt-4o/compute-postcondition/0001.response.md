The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` takes an integer input and `int` converts it to an integer. The range for `a` is given as 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, meaning `a` will now hold an input integer within that range. The values of `b` and `n` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 10,000,000; `n` is an input integer.**
