The code executes a print statement which outputs 'YES'. The other variables in the state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer, `n` is non-negative, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, and 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer, `n` is non-negative, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, and 'YES' has been printed.**
