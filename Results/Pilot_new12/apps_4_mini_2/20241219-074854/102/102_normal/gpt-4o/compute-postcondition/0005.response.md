The variable `y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. Given that `x` is 0, this simplifies to `y = (n - 0 * a) // b`, or `y = n // b`. The condition that `n - (x * a)` is divisible by `b` is satisfied, which implies that `n` is divisible by `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged, while `y` is computed based on the division.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer, `n` is non-negative, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`.**
