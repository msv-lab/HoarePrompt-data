To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we consider the variable changes and conditions specified in the code.

1. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, which is guaranteed to be non-empty. Hence, the loop will execute for every index from `0` to `len(s) - 1`.

2. The variable `prev_pos` starts at `-1` and is updated each time a vowel is encountered in the string. 

3. The variable `max_jump` tracks the maximum jump between consecutive vowels (or from the start of the string to the first vowel).

After the loop executes:

- `s` remains the same non-empty string.
- `prev_pos` will reflect the index of the last vowel found in the string. If there are no vowels, it would stay at the initial value of `-1`.
- `max_jump` will be determined by the positions of the vowels in the string. If at least one vowel is found, it will be at least `1`, representing the jump from the start to the first vowel. If no vowels are found, it remains `1` as initialized since there would be no update.
- The final value of `max_jump` will be the maximum distance found between the current vowel and the previous vowel position throughout the whole string.

Therefore, if we denote the last position of a vowel in `s` as `k` (if at least one vowel exists, otherwise `prev_pos` is `-1`), the output state can be outlined as follows.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel in `s` (or -1 if no vowels), `max_jump` is the maximum jump between consecutive vowels, which is at least 1.**
