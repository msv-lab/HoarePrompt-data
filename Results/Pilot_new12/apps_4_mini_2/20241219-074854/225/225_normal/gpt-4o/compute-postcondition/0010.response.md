The value of `prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is now 1, and `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 1).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 1, and `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 1)**
