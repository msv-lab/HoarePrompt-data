The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value or the length of the string `s` minus `prev_pos`. Since `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel in `s`, `len(s) - prev_pos` will yield the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. The updated value of `max_jump` will be either its previous value (which is at least 1) or potentially a larger value based on the distance calculated.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel in `s` (or -1 if no vowels), `max_jump` is the new maximum jump which is max of its previous value and `len(s) - prev_pos`.**
