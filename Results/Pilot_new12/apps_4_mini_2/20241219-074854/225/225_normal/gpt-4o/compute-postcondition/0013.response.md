In the given code snippet, the variable `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the result of `i - prev_pos`. We know that `i` is 2 and `prev_pos` is 0. Therefore, the calculation for `i - prev_pos` results in `2 - 0 = 2`.

The output of this code will depend on the previous value of `max_jump`. If `max_jump` is less than 2, it will get updated to 2; if `max_jump` is greater than or equal to 2, its value will remain unchanged.

However, we do not know the previous value of `max_jump`, so we cannot precisely state what the new value will be. Instead, we can say that `max_jump` will be equal to the maximum of its previous value and 2 after this code executes.

The values of `s`, `i`, and `prev_pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output will include all initial values with the updated information about `max_jump`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 2, `prev_pos` is 0, and `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 2)**.
