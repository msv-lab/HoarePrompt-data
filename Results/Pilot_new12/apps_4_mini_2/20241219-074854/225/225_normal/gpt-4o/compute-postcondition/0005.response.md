The `max_jump` variable is assigned the maximum value between its current value (`max_jump`) and the difference between the current index `i` and `prev_pos`. Given that `max_jump` is initially 1, `prev_pos` is -1, and `i` is 0, we can calculate:

1. `i - prev_pos` results in `0 - (-1)`, which is equal to `1`.
2. The expression `max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)` evaluates to `max(1, 1)`, resulting in `1`.

Since the values of `max_jump` before and after the calculation do not change, the output state retains the previous values for the unchanged variables. Therefore, after executing the code, we still have:

- `max_jump` remains `1`
- `prev_pos` is `-1`
- `i` is `0`
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
