According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `s` is a non-empty string, it has at least 2 characters. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, leading to `i` being 2. 

Since `prev_pos` is unchanged at 0 (assuming the character at index 1 was not a vowel), it does not affect the execution condition. Thus, the conditions for `i` remain held, and the `prev_pos` also needs to be accounted for if the character at the new index is determined.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 2, and `prev_pos` is 0**
