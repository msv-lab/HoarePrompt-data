According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` remains less than the length of the string `s`. Since we know that `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, the length of `s` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 (if `s[i]` is a vowel, `prev_pos` is set to 0 but `i` remains 0). Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, becoming 1.

For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, which is greater than 1 when `i` is 1. Thus, the updates required for the next iteration are for `i` to be 1 while the string remains non-empty.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0**
