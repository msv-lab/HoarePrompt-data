According to the code, the loop execution will depend on the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, the length of `s` is at least 1, allowing the loop to iterate at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 in the first iteration.

To ensure the loop executes properly, we can summarize the necessary states. The variable `i` should be initialized correctly at the start of the loop, and since the loop iterates over the range of the length of `s`, we can also note that the length of `s` is at least 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0**
