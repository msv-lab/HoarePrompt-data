The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum jump, which is calculated as the maximum of its previous value and the length of the string `s` minus the index of the last vowel (`prev_pos`). If there are no vowels in `s`, `prev_pos` is -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty string `s` and return the maximum jump based on the position of the last vowel in the string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string of capital English letters, and returns the maximum jump based on the index of the last vowel in `s`.**
