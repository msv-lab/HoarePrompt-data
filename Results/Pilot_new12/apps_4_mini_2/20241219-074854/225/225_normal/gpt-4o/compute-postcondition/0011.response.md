Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 1, and `prev_pos` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is a vowel, then `prev_pos` is updated to 1 and `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of `max_jump` and 1. If the character is not a vowel, `prev_pos` remains unchanged at 0.***
