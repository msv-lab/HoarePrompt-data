The variable `max_jump` is assigned the value `max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)`. The calculation of `i - prev_pos` uses the current values, where `i` is 1 and `prev_pos` is 0, resulting in `1 - 0 = 1`. The original value of `max_jump` is not provided, but it will be compared with 1 to determine the new value of `max_jump`. The states of the other variables (`s`, `i`, `prev_pos`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0, and `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 1)**
