Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 2, and `prev_pos` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is a vowel, then `prev_pos` is updated to 2 and `max_jump` is set to the maximum of its current value and 2. There is no else part of the code, so no other conditions are affected.***
