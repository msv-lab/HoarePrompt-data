The variable `prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently `2`. The value of `prev_pos` changes from `0` to `2`. The other variables `s` and `max_jump` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 2, `prev_pos` is now 2, and `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 2).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 2, `prev_pos` is 2, and `max_jump` is max(max_jump, 2)**
