The statement `vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}` initializes the variable `vowels` as a set containing the specified capital English letters. This does not affect the variable `s` in any way; its state remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100; `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.**
