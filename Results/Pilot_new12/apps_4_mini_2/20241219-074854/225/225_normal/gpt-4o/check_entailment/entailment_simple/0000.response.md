Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's how it aligns with the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes a non-empty string of capital English letters as input, which satisfies the precondition provided.

2. **Vowels Definition**: It clearly defines the set of vowels as 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y', matching the problem's requirement for what characters the Grasshopper can jump on.

3. **Jump Calculation**:
   - The variable `prev_pos` initializes at -1, indicating the starting position before any vowels. 
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, checks if it is a vowel, and calculates the distance (or jump) between this vowel and the last vowel's position.
   - It updates `max_jump` whenever it finds a new vowel, ensuring that it records the maximum distance jumped across vowels.
  
4. **Final Jump Calculation**: After the loop, it computes the jump needed to reach the end of the string by comparing `max_jump` with the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string (`len(s) - prev_pos`). This accounts for any sequence of characters following the last vowel.

5. **Output**: Finally, it returns the maximum jump ability required to reach the end of the string while only landing on vowels.

The program efficiently calculates the minimum jump ability the Grasshopper needs, according to the problem description, across various scenarios, including:
- Strings with no vowels where it would return a minimum jump of `len(s)`.
- Strings consisting of only vowels where it would always return `1`.
- Mixed strings where it correctly finds the longest gap between vowels.

In all cases, it adheres to the logic described in the problem statement, ensuring the Grasshopper can reach a position after the last character in the string while jumping only on vowels. Therefore, the program is correct.
