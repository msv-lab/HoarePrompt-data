Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements from the problem description. Here's the breakdown of how it complies:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading a non-empty string of capital English letters. This matches the problem's requirements, where the input string is guaranteed to be valid.

2. **Vowel Definition**: The program defines the set of vowels as 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y', which aligns with what the problem identifies as vowels.

3. **Jump Calculation Logic**: 
   - The function initializes `max_jump` to 1, which is appropriate because the Grasshopper can jump at least 1 space if there's a vowel.
   - It iterates through the string to find the positions of vowels and calculates the distance (jump) between them.
   - Notably, it updates `max_jump` to the maximum distance between consecutive vowels, ensuring that it captures the longest necessary jump.

4. **Final Calculation**: After checking all characters, the program calculates the potential jump from the last vowel to the end of the string using `max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)`. This crucial step ensures that the Grasshopper can jump from the last encountered vowel to the far end of the string, which is essential for determining the correct ability.

5. **Edge Cases Management**: 
   - If there are no vowels (though the problem guarantees non-empty input), it would fall back to returning the initial `max_jump` value of 1.
   - The logic also successfully accommodates strings composed entirely of vowels.

Therefore, the implemented function calculates the correct minimum jump ability that the Grasshopper needs to reach the end of the string by correctly measuring the longest distance between vowels, ensuring it adheres to every aspect of the problem description. 

Consequently, the program meets the requirements fully, confirming its correctness.
