Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when there are no vowels in the input string. According to the problem description, the Grasshopper should only be able to jump on vowels. The logic of setting the initial `max_jump` to 1 and returning it when there are no vowels is incorrect, as one cannot make a jump without a vowel to land on. 

For example, consider the input string "BCDFGH". This string contains no vowels. The program would return 1, implying that the Grasshopper can "jump" without any vowels, which is not in line with the problem description. This scenario demonstrates that the program does not work for every potential case as required. Thus, the output cannot be considered correct.
