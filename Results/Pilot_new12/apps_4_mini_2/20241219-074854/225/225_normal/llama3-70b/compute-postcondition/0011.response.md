Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `s`, which is `s[0]`, is a vowel. If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is updated to max of its previous value and 1. Otherwise, if `last_vowel` is not -1, then `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the expression `(0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.***
