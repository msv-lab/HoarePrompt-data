The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the greater of its current value or `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, `i + 1` equals 2. Hence, `max_jump` will be assigned the maximum of its existing value and 2. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `last_vowel` is 0; `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 2.**
