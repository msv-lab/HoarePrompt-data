The variable `last_vowel` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. Since the character at index `i` of `s` is a vowel, `last_vowel` will now hold the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged in their states. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `last_vowel` is 0; if `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is updated to max of its previous value and 1; otherwise, if `last_vowel` is not -1, then `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the expression `(0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.**
