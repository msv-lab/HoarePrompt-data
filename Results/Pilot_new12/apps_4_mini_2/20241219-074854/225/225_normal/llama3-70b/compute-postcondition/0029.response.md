Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; if the index of the last vowel (`last_vowel`) is not equal to `n - 1`, then `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.***
