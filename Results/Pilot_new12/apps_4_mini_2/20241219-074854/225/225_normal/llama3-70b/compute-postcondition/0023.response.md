Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2. If `last_vowel` was equal to -1, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and 3, and `last_vowel` may be updated to 1. If `last_vowel` is not -1, and if `s[2]` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is set to 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged, and `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, (2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`.***
