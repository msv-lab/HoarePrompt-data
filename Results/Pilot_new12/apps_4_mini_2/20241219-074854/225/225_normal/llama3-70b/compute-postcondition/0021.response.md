The `max_jump` variable is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so the calculation is `i + 1`, which equals 3. The value of `max_jump` might be changed depending on its previous state, but we do not know its exact value before this operation. 

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `last_vowel` may be updated to 1; `max_jump` is updated to max(`max_jump`, 3)**.
