The variable `max_jump` is initialized to 0. This does not depend on any values from the initial state, and the changes only affect `max_jump`. The other variables `s`, `vowels`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `max_jump` is 0.**
