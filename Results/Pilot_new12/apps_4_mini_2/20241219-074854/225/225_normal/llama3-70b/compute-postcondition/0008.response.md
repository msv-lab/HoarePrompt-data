The value of `max_jump` is updated by finding the maximum between its current value and `i + 1`. Given that `i` is currently 0, we have `i + 1` equal to 1. Therefore, `max_jump` will be updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged and valid.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `s`, which is `s[0]`, is a vowel; the value of `last_vowel` is -1; `max_jump` is updated to max(max_jump, 1)**
