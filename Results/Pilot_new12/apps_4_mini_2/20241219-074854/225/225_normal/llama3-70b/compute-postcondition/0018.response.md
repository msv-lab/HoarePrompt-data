The value of `last_vowel` is updated to the value of `i`, which is currently 1. This means `last_vowel` now holds the specific value of 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state thus reflects the updated value of `last_vowel`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `last_vowel` is 1.**
