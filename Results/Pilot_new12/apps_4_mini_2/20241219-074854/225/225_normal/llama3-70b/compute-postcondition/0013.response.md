Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `last_vowel` is 0. If `s[i]` is a vowel, then if `last_vowel` is -1, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 1; otherwise, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `(0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.***
