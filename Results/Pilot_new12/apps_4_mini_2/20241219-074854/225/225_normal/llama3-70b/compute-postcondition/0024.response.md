The variable `last_vowel` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The other variables `s`, `vowels`, `n`, and `max_jump` remain unchanged in their previous states but are still relevant for understanding the context. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to the `last_vowel` variable.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `last_vowel` is 2.**
