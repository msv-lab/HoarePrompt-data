The code snippet executes the `print` statement, which outputs the current value of `max_jump`. Since the value of `max_jump` is determined by prior calculations involving the variable `n`, and the condition regarding the last vowel, the output doesn't change any variable states but simply prints the current value of `max_jump`.

The states of the other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `n`, and `last_vowel`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; if the index of the last vowel (`last_vowel`) is not equal to `n - 1`, then `max_jump` remains at its calculated value.**
