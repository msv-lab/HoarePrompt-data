Functionality: **The function calculates the maximum jump between consecutive vowels in a given non-empty string consisting exclusively of uppercase letters (A-Z), where the length of the string does not exceed 100 characters. It determines the maximum distance between any two vowels or from the start or end of the string to the nearest vowel. The final output is the maximum jump value, which is printed to the console. If no vowels are present, the function effectively defaults to a jump of 0 since it would not capture any legitimate vowel indices. The function does not return a value; it only prints the result.**
