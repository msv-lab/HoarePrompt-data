According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2, if the character at index `i` of `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is updated to 1.**
