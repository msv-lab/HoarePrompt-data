Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of uppercase English letters (A-Z); `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `s`, which is `s[0]`, is a vowel (one of the characters in `vowels`); and the variable `last_vowel` is not equal to -1 (which means that there is at least one vowel found in the string `s` prior to index `i`).***
