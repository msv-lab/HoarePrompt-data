Correctness: **False**

The program intended to find the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper to reach the end of a string by jumping only on vowels. However, it incorrectly calculates the jump lengths in the following ways:

1. The calculation of the maximum jump between consecutive vowels is flawed. The formula `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` does not yield the correct maximum jump distance required to reach the next vowel. Instead, it should simply capture the distance between the current vowel and the last vowel.

2. If no vowels are present in the string, the program currently does not handle this case correctly. According to the problem statement, if there are no vowels in the string at all, the Grasshopper cannot jump and should not be able to reach the end.

3. It fails to account for the fact that the Grasshopper starts right before the first character of the string (not at index 0), which means the output must consider the distance from the start to the first vowel as well as from the last vowel to the end of the string.

For these reasons, there are scenarios where the program's output will not satisfy the problem requirements correctly, making the correctness determination fall to **False**. 

For example, an input like "BCDFG" (with no vowels) should yield a result indicating it is impossible to jump (which the program does not provide), and inputs may yield the wrong minimum jump ability based on incorrect distance calculations.
