You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;

Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to analyze the implementation and consider potential edge cases.

### Program Analysis:
The program aims to determine:
1. The maximum number of questions a pupil is asked.
2. The minimum number of questions a pupil is asked.
3. The number of times Sergei, seated in the x-th row and y-th position, is asked a question.

#### Logic Breakdown:
- It calculates the `full_cycle_length`, which determines how many questions are asked in a complete traversal of all rows.
- `full_cycles` calculates how many complete cycles can be made with the given `k` questions, while `remaining_questions` gives the number of questions left after full cycles.
- It determines the minimum and maximum number of questions a pupil could receive based on the complete cycles.
- Then it specifically accounts for how many times Sergei is asked during full and remaining questions, considering the current row direction.
  
### Potential Issues:
1. **Maximum Questions Calculation**: The way `max_questions` is computed appears to reflect a linear increase during full cycles and then a decrement during the row traversal. This could lead to incorrect counts because groups of pupils are not equally incremented or decremented depending on their seating position.
  
2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not adequately address scenarios when either `n` or `m` is small (like `1`), which might lead to imbalance in rows or pupils being asked more frequently than expected.

3. **Large Inputs Consideration**: The logic to handle edge cases when `k` is very large (close to `10^18`) is not thoroughly verified. Particularly, modular arithmetic could potentially miscount if not adjusted correctly. 

4. **Single Row Handling**: In instances where `n = 1` (e.g., `1 5 10 1 1`), the full cycle logic should ideally remain straightforward and count accurately without additional overhead.

### Examples for Potential Failure:
- If `n = 1`, `m = 5`, `k = 10`, `x = 1`, `y = 1`, according to the logic, all pupils in the single row should be asked the same number of questions, which means each should get `k/m` each (e.g., `10 // 5 = 2`) - expected would be all `2`. The implementation needs to account for the left-over questions accurately.

### Conclusion:
Given these considerations, I can spot discrepancies in how certain edge cases might be handled and fluctuating counts due to directional changes in asking pupils.

Therefore, the program does **not** meet every requirement or edge case as described. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The code probably mismanages the counting logic for the max and min questions, particularly under edge cases, leading to incorrect results.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the number of rows and pupils per row respectively, k is a positive integer representing the number of questions asked, x and y are integers representing Sergei's seating position such that 1 <= x <= n and 1 <= y <= m.
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m
    full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
    remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
    min_questions = full_cycles
    max_questions = full_cycles
    if (n > 1) :
        min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
        max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, and `max_questions` are integers, with `n` as a positive integer. If `n > 1`, `max_questions` is assigned the value `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. Otherwise, the value of `max_questions` remains unchanged.
    sergei_questions = min_questions
    if (x == 0 or x == n - 1) :
        sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1
    )
    else :
        sergei_questions = (full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 *
    n - 2) >= x)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, and `max_questions` are integers with `n` as a positive integer. If `x` is equal to 0 or `x` is equal to `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` is updated based on the formula `sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (1 if full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1 else 0)`. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` is calculated using the expression `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`, and `sergei_questions` remains equal to `min_questions`, while `x` is neither 0 nor `n - 1.
