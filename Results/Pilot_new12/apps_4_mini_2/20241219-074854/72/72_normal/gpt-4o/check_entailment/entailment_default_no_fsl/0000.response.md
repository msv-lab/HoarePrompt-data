Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. A notable case is when there is only one row (`n = 1`). The calculation for `max_questions` and `min_questions` does not adjust properly in this situation, resulting in potential inaccuracies for the output.

For instance, if we consider the input case with one row and temperature questions to be asked, like:
```
1 3 8 1 1
```
The expected output should be `3 2 3` as the teacher keeps asking the same student from that single row. However, the logic that calculates the maximum number of questions (`max_questions`) for the single row scenario is flawed. The program would misrepresent the number of maximum questions distributed among students and would also miscalculate the minimum.

This shows that the program does not adhere to the specifications laid out in the problem description correctly for every potential case, particularly in edge cases noted above.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
