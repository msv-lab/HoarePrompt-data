According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `col` and the value of `m`. The loop will continue to iterate as long as `col` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `col` is 1, and since `m` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `col` must be increased by 1. The next value of `col` will be 2, and it must still be less than `m`.

Therefore, we need to state that `col` is now 2, and since `m` is at least 1, `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 2**
