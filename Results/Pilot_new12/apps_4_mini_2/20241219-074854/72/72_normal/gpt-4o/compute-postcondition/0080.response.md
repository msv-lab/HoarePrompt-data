Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_questions` is an integer, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, if `row` was previously equal to `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2`, `col` is equal to `y`, and `direction` is set to -1. If `row` was not equal to `n`, the state remains unchanged.***
