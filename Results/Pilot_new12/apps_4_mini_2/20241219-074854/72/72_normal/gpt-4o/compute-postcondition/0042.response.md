Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer, `max_questions` is greater than or equal to its previous value plus 1 (if `direction` is 1 and `row` equals `n - 2`) or one less than its previous value (if `direction` is not equal to 1 and `row` is either 1 or a negative value), `col` is 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1.***
