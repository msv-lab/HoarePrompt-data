The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged but the value of `direction` is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is incremented by `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is incremented by `-1`.**
