Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than or equal to 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is an integer representing the total questions Sergei has processed + 2 if `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`; otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `max_questions` is now `max_questions + 1`, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 2` and `direction` is -1.***
