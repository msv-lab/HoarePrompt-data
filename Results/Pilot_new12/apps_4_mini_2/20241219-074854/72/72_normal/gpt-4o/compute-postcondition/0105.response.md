Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is between 0 and `n`, `y` is between 0 and `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, and `col` is 2. If `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
