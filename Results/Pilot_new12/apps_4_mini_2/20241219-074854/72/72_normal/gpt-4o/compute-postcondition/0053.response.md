Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer, `max_questions` is greater than or equal to its previous value plus 2 if `direction` equals 1 and `row` equals `n - 2`, or one less than its previous value plus 1, if `direction` is not equal to 1 and `row` is either 1 or a negative value, and `col` is 1. If `direction` equals 1 and `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated by subtracting 2 from its previous value. Otherwise, if `direction` is not equal to 1 and `row` is equal to -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 3`. If neither condition is met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
