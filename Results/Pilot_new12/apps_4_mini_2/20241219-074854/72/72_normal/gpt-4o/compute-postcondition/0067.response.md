Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer. If `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is updated to `row - 3`, and `direction` is set to -1 if `row` equals `n`. Otherwise, if `direction` does not equal 1, then `max_questions` is reduced by 1, `row` is increased by 3, and `direction` is set to 1 if `row` equals -1.***
