Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, and `max_questions` are integers; `sergei_questions` is the result of the expression `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`; `sergei_questions` is equal to `min_questions`. `x` is not equal to 0 and is not equal to `n - 1`.**
