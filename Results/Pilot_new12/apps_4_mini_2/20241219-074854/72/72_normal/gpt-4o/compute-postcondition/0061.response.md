Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is updated to `row - 3`, and `direction` is set to -1 if `row` is equal to `n` since there is no else part in the code.***
