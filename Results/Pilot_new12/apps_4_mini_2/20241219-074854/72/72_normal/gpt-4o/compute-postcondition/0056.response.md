Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer, and `max_questions` is adjusted based on the conditions; if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.***
