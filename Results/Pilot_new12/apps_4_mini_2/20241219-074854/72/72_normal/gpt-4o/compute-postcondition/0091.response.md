Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.***
