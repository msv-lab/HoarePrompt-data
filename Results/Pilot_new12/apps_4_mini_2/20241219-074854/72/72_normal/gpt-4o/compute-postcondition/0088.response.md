Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, and `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and if `row` was previously equal to `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2`, `col` remains equal to `y`, and `direction` is set to -1; if `row` was not equal to `n`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `direction` is not 1, then `max_questions` is one less than its previous value, `direction` is now 1, and if `row` was -1, the current value of `row` is updated to 1.***
