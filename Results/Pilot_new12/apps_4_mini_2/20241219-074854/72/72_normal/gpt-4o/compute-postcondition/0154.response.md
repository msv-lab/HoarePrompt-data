Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than or equal to 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `direction` is 1, and `sergei_questions` is an integer greater than or equal to its previous value + 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is updated to `row - 2`, and `col` is incremented by 1.***
