To calculate `sergei_questions`, we follow the expression provided in the code. The variable `full_cycles` is divided by `(2 * n - 2)` to get the number of complete cycles, and we check if there is at least 1 remaining cycle using the modulus operation.

The formula for `sergei_questions` is:
```
sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)
```

Since `n` is a positive integer, `(2 * n - 2)` is guaranteed to be positive. The division results in an integer and `full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1` evaluates to either `0` (False) or `1` (True), depending on whether there are remaining questions after accounting for full cycles.

After executing the code:
- The value of `sergei_questions` is updated according to the calculation above.
- Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, and `max_questions` are integers; `sergei_questions` is updated based on the formula `sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (1 if full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1 else 0)`.**
