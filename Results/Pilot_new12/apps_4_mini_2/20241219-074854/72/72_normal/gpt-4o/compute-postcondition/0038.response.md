Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions` are all greater than 0; `min_questions` is an integer; `max_questions` is one less than its previous value; `row` is either 1 or a negative value; `col` is 0; and `direction` is not equal to 1. If `row` is -1, then `row` is updated to 1, `col` remains 0, and `direction` becomes 1.***
