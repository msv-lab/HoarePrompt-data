Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is between 0 and `n`, `y` is between 0 and `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 2. If `direction` is 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is decreased by 3. If `direction` is not 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` is -1, then `row` is increased by 2.***
