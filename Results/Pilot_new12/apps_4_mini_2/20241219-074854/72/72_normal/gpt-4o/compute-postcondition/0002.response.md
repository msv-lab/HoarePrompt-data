The statement `y -= 1` decreases the value of `y` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged; thus, the output state will reflect only the change to `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of pupils per row, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of questions asked, `x` is an integer representing Sergei's updated seating position in row (now `x - 1`), `y` is now updated to be `y - 1`.**
