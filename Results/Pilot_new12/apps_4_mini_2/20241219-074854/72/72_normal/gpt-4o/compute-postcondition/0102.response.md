Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 1. If `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, if `direction` is not 1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and if `row` is -1, `row` is increased by 3; otherwise, `row` remains unchanged.***
