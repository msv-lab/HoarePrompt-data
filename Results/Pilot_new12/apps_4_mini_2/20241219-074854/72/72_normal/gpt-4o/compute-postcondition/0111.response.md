The statement `max_questions -= 1` decreases the value of `max_questions` by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged and continue to satisfy their initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is between 0 and `n`, `y` is between 0 and `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 2, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is between 0 and `n`, `y` is between 0 and `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1**.
