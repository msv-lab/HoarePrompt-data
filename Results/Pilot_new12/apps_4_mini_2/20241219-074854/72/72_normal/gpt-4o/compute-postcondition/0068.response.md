Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is the total columns processed, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `min_questions` is an integer, and `max_questions` is an integer that might have increased or decreased based on the changes from the `direction` and `row`. If the loop executes fully, `row` will be back in the range [0, n-1]. Finally, if `row` hits `n` or -1 during the transitions, `direction` will have changed accordingly between 1 and -1.**
