Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than or equal to 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is an integer representing the total questions Sergei has processed + 1. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1; if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `n - 2` and `direction` becomes -1, otherwise, all variable values remain unchanged. If `direction` is not 1, then `row` is updated from -1 to 1, `direction` is set to 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `col` remains 0.***
