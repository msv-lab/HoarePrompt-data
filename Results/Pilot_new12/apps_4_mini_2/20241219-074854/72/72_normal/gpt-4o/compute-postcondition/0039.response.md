Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer, and `max_questions` is an integer that is either greater than or equal to its previous value plus 1 (if `direction` is 1 and `row` equals `n - 2`) or one less than its previous value (if `direction` is not equal to 1 and `row` is either 1 or a negative value). If `row` equals `n`, then `direction` changes to -1 and `row` is set to `n - 2`. If `row` is -1, then `row` is updated to 1, `col` remains 0, and `direction` becomes 1.
