Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than or equal to 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `sergei_questions` is an integer representing the total questions Sergei has processed + 1, `row` is in the range [0, n-1], `direction` is either 1 or -1, `max_questions` is an integer, and `col` is 0. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. In all other cases, there is no change in state as there is no else part.***
