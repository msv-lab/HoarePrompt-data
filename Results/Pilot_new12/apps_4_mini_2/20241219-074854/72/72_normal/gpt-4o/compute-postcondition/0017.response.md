Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, and `max_questions` are integers with `n` as a positive integer. If `x` is equal to 0 or `x` is equal to `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` is updated based on the formula `sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (1 if full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1 else 0)`. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` is calculated using the expression `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`, and `sergei_questions` remains equal to `min_questions`, while `x` is neither 0 nor `n - 1.***
