Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_questions` is an integer, and `max_questions` is an integer that might have increased or decreased based on changes from `direction` and `row`. `row` is equal to `x`, `col` is equal to `y`, and `row` will be back in the range [0, n-1], with `direction` having changed accordingly between 1 and -1 if `row` hits `n` or -1 during the transitions.***
