Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and if `row` equals `n`, then `direction` is set to -1, `sergei_questions` is an integer greater than or equal to its previous value + 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `row` is updated to `row - 1`. Otherwise, `max_questions` is decremented by 1, and if `row` equals -1, then `row` is increased by 3.***
