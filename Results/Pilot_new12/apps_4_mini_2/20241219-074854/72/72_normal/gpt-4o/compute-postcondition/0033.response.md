Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer, `max_questions` is one less than its previous value, `row` is 0, `col` is 0, and `direction` is not equal to 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1; otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
