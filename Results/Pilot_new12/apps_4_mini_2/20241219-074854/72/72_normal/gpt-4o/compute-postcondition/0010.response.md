To determine the output state, we need to analyze the formula given in the Python code.

The variable `max_questions` is calculated using the formula `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. Consequently, `max_questions` is updated based on the values of `full_cycles` and `n`.

Since we do not have any specific values for `full_cycles` and `n`, we cannot compute an exact numerical result. However, we can express `max_questions` in terms of `full_cycles` and `n`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `max_questions` is being assigned a value based on this relationship.

Output State: **`max_questions` is assigned the value `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`**
