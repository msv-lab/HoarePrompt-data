The value of `max_questions` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `max_questions` is unknown. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer, `max_questions` is greater than or equal to its previous value plus 1, `row` is 0, `direction` is 1, and `col` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer, `max_questions` is greater than or equal to its previous value plus 1, `row` is 0, `direction` is 1, and `col` is 0.**
