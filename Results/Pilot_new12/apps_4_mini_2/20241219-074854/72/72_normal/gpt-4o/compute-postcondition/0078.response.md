Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_questions` is an integer, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is equal to `n`, `col` is equal to `y`, `direction` is -1. If `row` was previously equal to `x`, `sergei_questions` would have been incremented by 1, otherwise, there is no change to the state.**
