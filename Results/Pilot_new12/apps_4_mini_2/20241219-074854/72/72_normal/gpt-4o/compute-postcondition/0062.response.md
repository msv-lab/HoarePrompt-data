The variable `max_questions` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer, and `max_questions` is reduced by 1.
