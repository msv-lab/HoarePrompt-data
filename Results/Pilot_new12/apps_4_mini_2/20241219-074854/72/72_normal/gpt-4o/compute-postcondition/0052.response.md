Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is greater than 0, `full_cycle_length` is greater than 0, `full_cycles` is greater than 0, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is an integer, `max_questions` is one less than its previous value (greater than or equal to its previous value), and `col` is 1. If `row` is equal to -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 3`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
