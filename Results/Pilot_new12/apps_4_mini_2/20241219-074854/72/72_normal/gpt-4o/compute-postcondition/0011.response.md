Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, and `max_questions` are integers, with `n` as a positive integer. If `n > 1`, `max_questions` is assigned the value `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. Otherwise, the value of `max_questions` remains unchanged.***
