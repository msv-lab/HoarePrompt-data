Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly take into account the specific pupil's position within a row (represented by the variable `y`). The program calculates maximum and minimum questions asked based solely on the number of rows (`n`), pupils (`m`), and the number of questions (`k`), but it neglects the distinction of the individual seats (or pupils) in each row.

For example, if there are multiple pupils in each row (`m > 1`), the questions will be distributed among all pupils within that row, and each pupil will receive questions depending on their seating position. The program fails to account for the `y` index, which distinguishes between different pupils in the same row. Therefore, the `max_asked` and `min_asked` calculations produced by the program do not reflect the distribution accurately across all students.

To illustrate a failure case, consider the input:

```
3 2 7 2 1
```

For this case:
1. There are 3 rows and 2 pupils per row.
2. The teacher asks questions in a back-and-forth manner.
3. The expected distribution of questions would not match the simplistic calculation used in the program since pupils in the same row will have a different number of questions based on their seat position.

Thus, the absence of logic to factor in `y` means the output is potentially incorrect based on the problem specifications, leading to the conclusion that the program is not correct for all potential cases.
