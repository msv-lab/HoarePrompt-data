You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the provided program's correctness according to the problem description, we need to examine how it handles different scenarios based on the requirement to compute the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's asked count.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Maximizing Questions Asked**: 
   ```python
   max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
   ```
   This line is intended to calculate the maximum number of questions any pupil could have been asked based on the total questions (`k`) and how the rows are asked (in a zig-zag fashion). However, it appears that it does not take into account that pupils could be asked more than once in cases where `k` is sufficiently large. For example, if `k` exceeds sufficient rounds, the calculation might need to account for extra asks.

2. **Minimizing Questions Asked**:
   ```python
   min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
   ```
   Here, it attempts to ensure at least a minimum of one question for someone. However, if `k` is very small relative to `n * m`, some pupils may just not get asked at all, which could lead to a scenario where the minimum asked count is not accurately represented because not everyone has a chance to be asked.

3. **Counting Sergei's Questions**:
   ```python
   sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
   ```
   While this attempts to calculate how many times Sergei got asked based on the current position in the row (`x`), the handling of `k` and its interaction with his position might lead to inaccuracies due to the issue with vertical overflow as described for the other calculations.

### Identified Case for Failure:
To illustrate the failure points:
- Let's consider the inputs where there's only a single row (e.g., `n=1`), `m=3`, and `k=8`. The description states that one pupil could be asked from that row repeatedly. The computation for `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` does not seem to accurately reflect the actual count of how many asks can converge on one pupil in these setups.

For example, with `n=1`, `m=3`, and `k=8`, one pupil should be asked 8 times, yet `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` will not correctly produce `8, 8, 8`. Instead, the results will erroneously produce smaller numbers that do not accurately represent what the problem described.

### Conclusion:
The implementation does not correctly account for scenarios where the number of questions (`k`) exceeds simple row traversals in both single and multiple row setups. Therefore, since it does not work correctly under certain inputs, the output is not accurate as per the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads input integers representing the number of rows (n), pupils per row (m), total questions asked (k), and the row (x) and position (y) of a specific pupil. It then calculates and outputs three values: the maximum number of questions asked by any pupil given k questions distributed among n rows (`max_asked`), the minimum number of questions that each pupil has been asked based on the distribution (`min_asked`), and the specific number of questions asked to Sergei in row x and position y (`sergei_asked`). The function does not use variable y in its calculations, which could represent a missing aspect of tracking specific positions within rows. All the calculations treat the inputs as valid integers, but it does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases related to input constraints explicitly, apart from assuming they fall within expected ranges.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
