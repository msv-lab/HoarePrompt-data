The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are all assigned from the input, where each variable is converted to an integer. The specific values of these variables depend on the input provided by the user, but they are all guaranteed to be positive integers. Therefore, the output state will reflect that these variables now hold the values of the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, assigned from user input.**
