Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `x` is a positive integer
- `y` is a positive integer
- `max_asked` is equal to \((k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)\)
- `min_asked` is equal to \(\max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))\)
- `sergei_asked` is equal to \((k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) \% (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)\)

Now, after executing the `print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)` line, the output consists of the evaluated values of the variables `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked`, but the variables themselves remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `max_asked` is \((k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)\), `min_asked` is \(\max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))\), `sergei_asked` is \((k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) \% (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)\).**
