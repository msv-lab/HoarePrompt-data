Functionality: **The function reads input integers representing the number of rows (n), pupils per row (m), total questions asked (k), and the row (x) and position (y) of a specific pupil. It then calculates and outputs three values: the maximum number of questions asked by any pupil given k questions distributed among n rows (`max_asked`), the minimum number of questions that each pupil has been asked based on the distribution (`min_asked`), and the specific number of questions asked to Sergei in row x and position y (`sergei_asked`). The function does not use variable y in its calculations, which could represent a missing aspect of tracking specific positions within rows. All the calculations treat the inputs as valid integers, but it does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases related to input constraints explicitly, apart from assuming they fall within expected ranges.**
