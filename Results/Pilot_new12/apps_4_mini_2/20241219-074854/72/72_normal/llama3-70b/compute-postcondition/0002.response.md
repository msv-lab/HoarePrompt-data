To find `min_asked`, it is assigned the value `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`. The variable `max_asked` is defined as `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`, and since `n` is a positive integer, `(n - 1)` is non-negative. Therefore, `max_asked - (n - 1)` will not decrease below 1 unless `max_asked` itself is less than or equal to `n - 1`. 

In summary:
- The value of `max_asked` is determined based on variables `k` and `n`.
- The result of `max_asked - (n - 1)` is then checked against 1 to ensure `min_asked` is at least 1.

The states of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Thus, `min_asked` will be set to a value that is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `max_asked` is equal to (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n), `min_asked` is equal to max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))**
