The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the number of rows and pupils per row, respectively. The parameter `k` is a positive integer indicating the total number of questions asked. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers that represent Sergei's row and position in the row, with constraints ensuring that `1 <= x <= n` and `1 <= y <= m`. The function does not explicitly provide a return value in the question, so we cannot specify it here. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers and `x`, `y` are integers constrained within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers) and x, y (integers constrained by 1 <= x <= n and 1 <= y <= m).**
