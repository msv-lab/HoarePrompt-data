The calculation for `max_asked` is performed based on the formula provided, which divides `(k + (n - 1))` by `(2 * n)`. Given that `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are all positive integers, the state of the variables will be updated accordingly. The output will specify the value of `max_asked` based on the initial values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `max_asked` is equal to (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)**
