Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle scenarios where the grasshopper starts (G) to the left of the insect (T) and the distance between them is not a multiple of k. Specifically, it can miss the case where while the grasshopper can jump to the cell with the insect, an obstacle might be located at an index that would block that path. 

For example, consider the input:

```
7 3
G#T....
```

Here, G is at index 0, T is at index 2, and there is an obstacle ('#') at index 1. The grasshopper cannot reach the insect because the first jump (of length 3) would take it to index 3, which is not even close to T. The program does not account for blocks in positions that may appear reachable based on jump distance alone. 

In this case, it will incorrectly print "YES" because it only checks from G to T, without properly validating if the direct path (considering obstacles) allows the grasshopper to reach T in any of its allowed jumps (k). 

Thus, the code does not meet the requirements for all potential cases as described in the problem.
