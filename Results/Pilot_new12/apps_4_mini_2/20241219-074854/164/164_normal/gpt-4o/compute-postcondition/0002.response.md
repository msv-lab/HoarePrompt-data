The code executes the `index` method on the string `line`, which searches for the position of the character 'G' within it. The position returned is an integer representing the index at which 'G' is found in the string `line`. 

Since the value of `line` is not provided directly here, we will retain the condition that it consists of exactly `n` characters, which still includes 'G'. Therefore, `G_pos` will be defined with a specific index of where 'G' is located in `line`.

Given the constraints, `G_pos` will be a specific integer value, but since we don't know the actual string, we can describe it generally.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string consisting of exactly n characters including '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`.**
