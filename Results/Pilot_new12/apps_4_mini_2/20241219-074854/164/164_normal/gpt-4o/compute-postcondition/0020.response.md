The code `break` indicates that we exit from the most inner loop or if statement. As a result, the values of the variables do not change during this operation. The variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `line[pos]` is equal to '#', `pos` is `T_pos - k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
