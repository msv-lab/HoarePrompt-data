The `break` statement does not modify the values of any variables directly. It simply indicates that we are breaking out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Therefore, all the initial states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `line[pos]` is equal to '#', `pos` is `T_pos - k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
