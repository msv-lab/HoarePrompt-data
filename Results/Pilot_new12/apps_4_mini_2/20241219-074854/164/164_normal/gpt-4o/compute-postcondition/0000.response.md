The code assigns new values to `n` and `k` based on the input provided by the user. The function `map(int, input().split())` splits the input string into two parts and converts them into integers. Therefore, `n` and `k` will now have values that are integers within the specified ranges. Other variables in the initial state are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), and the input string consists of exactly n characters including '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' with 'G' and 'T' appearing exactly once; `n` and `k` are the integers input by the user.**
