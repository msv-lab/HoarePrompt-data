The code swaps the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos`. Since the initial condition states that the current value of `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, after the swap, `G_pos` will take the value of `T_pos`, and `T_pos` will take the value of `G_pos`.

Let the initial values be represented as follows:
- `G_pos` = a (where a > b)
- `T_pos` = b

After executing the code:
- `G_pos` = b
- `T_pos` = a

Thus, the updated output state will reflect the new values of `G_pos` and `T_pos` while retaining the valid conditions for `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string consisting of exactly n characters including '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `T_pos`, `T_pos` is now equal to the previous value of `G_pos`, and `G_pos` is less than `T_pos`.**
