The input is assigned to the variable `line`, which is expected to contain exactly `n` characters that include the characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. The previous values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the valid state reflects that `line` will hold the user input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string consisting of exactly n characters including '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.**
