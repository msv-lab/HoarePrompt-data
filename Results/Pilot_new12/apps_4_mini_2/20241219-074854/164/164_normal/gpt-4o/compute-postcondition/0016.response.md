According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variable `pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`. In the previous iteration, `pos` is at its current value which is incremented by `k` each time the loop executes, starting from `G_pos` and going up to `T_pos`. 

Given that `pos` has reached or is equal to `T_pos` in the last iteration, it will not execute again since the next value of `pos` would exceed `T_pos` after adding `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we must adjust `pos` to reflect that it hasn’t yet reached beyond `T_pos`.

Since `pos` is incremented by `k`, for the loop to execute again, it should be equal to `T_pos` minus `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, and `line[pos]` is equal to '#', `pos` is `T_pos - k`**
