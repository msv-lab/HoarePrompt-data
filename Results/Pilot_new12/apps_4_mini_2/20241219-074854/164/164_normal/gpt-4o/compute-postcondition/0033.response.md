Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), and `G_pos` is less than `T_pos`. If `reachable` is True, then there are no obstacles between `G_pos` and `T_pos`, so `pos` is equal to `T_pos` and the output 'YES' was printed. If `reachable` is False, then `pos` is the index of the last valid position before the obstacle and the output 'NO' was printed.***
