`T_pos` is assigned the index of the character 'T' in the `line` string. The initial state indicates that `line` is guaranteed to be a string of exactly `n` characters, which includes 'T', so `T_pos` can be determined from that. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string consisting of exactly n characters including '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`; `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is an input string consisting of exactly n characters including '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`; `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`.**
