The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or block of code we were directly inside. Therefore, the states remain the same, and we note the break action.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `line[pos]` is equal to '#', the current value of `pos` is equal to `T_pos`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
