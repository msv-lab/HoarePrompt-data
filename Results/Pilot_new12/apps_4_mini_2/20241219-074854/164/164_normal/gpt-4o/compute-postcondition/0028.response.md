Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `G_pos` is less than `T_pos`, `reachable` is True if there are no obstacles ('#') between `G_pos` and `T_pos` that prevent the loop from reaching `T_pos`, in which case `pos` is equal to `T_pos`; if there is an obstacle, `reachable` is False and `pos` is the index of the last valid position before the obstacle.**
