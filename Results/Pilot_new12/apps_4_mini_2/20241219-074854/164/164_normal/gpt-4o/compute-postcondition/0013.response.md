The value of `reachable` is assigned `True`, which means it remains unchanged as it was already `True`. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected, and all preconditions remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `line[pos]` is equal to '#', and the current value of `pos` is equal to `T_pos`.**
