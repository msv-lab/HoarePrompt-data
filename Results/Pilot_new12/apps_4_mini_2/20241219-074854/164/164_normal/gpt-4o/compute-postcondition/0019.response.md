The variable `reachable` is explicitly set to `True`. The previous state indicates that `reachable` was already `True`, so its value remains unchanged. There are no changes to other variables in the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects this unchanged condition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True, `line[pos]` is equal to '#', `pos` is `T_pos - k`, and `reachable` remains True.**
