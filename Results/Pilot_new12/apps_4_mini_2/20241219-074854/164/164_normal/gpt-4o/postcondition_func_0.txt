The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a string of exactly `n` characters that includes two unique characters, 'G' and 'T', along with obstacles represented by '#'. It determines whether it is possible for 'G' to reach 'T' by moving `k` steps at a time without encountering obstacles. The function outputs 'YES' if 'G' can reach 'T' without impediment; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. Edge cases include the condition where 'G' and 'T' are adjacent (where `T_pos` is exactly one `k` move away), potential obstacles existing between them, or if they are in the reverse order (i.e., 'T' appears before 'G', which it corrects automatically).
