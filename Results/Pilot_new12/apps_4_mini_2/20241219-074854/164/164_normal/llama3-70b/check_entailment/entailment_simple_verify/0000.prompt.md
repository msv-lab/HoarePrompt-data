You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    elif abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let’s analyze the logic and handling of potential edge cases.

### Code Analysis
The program does the following:
1. It reads the values `n` (number of cells) and `k` (the jump length).
2. It reads the string representing the cells.
3. It finds the positions of the grasshopper (`G`) and the insect (`T`).
4. It checks if the absolute difference between the positions of `G` and `T` is divisible by `k`, which would mean that the grasshopper can potentially reach the insect by making jumps of length `k`.
5. It verifies that there are no obstacles (`#`) in the path of the grasshopper for each jump taken. 

### Potential Issues
- The logic for checking obstacles only considers cells that the grasshopper can jump to using a modulo indexing method, which does not account for the fact that the grasshopper might not be able to land on an empty cell due to obstacles being on that path.
- The condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))` checks for obstacles using the modulo index, which may lead to incorrect skipping of cells that are not actually reachable without obstacles.
  
#### Example Case
Let's create a case that might not work correctly:
- Input:
```
6 2
G.#T..
```
Where the grasshopper (`G`) is at index `0`, and the insect (`T`) is at index `3`. The `k` value is `2`.
- The grasshopper can potentially jump to index `2` using the modulo method, but cannot jump to index `3` due to the obstacle at index `1`. 

Expected output for this case is `NO` since jumping is blocked, but the current implementation could mistakenly imply that there is a reachable path due to how obstacles are checked modulo `n`.

### Conclusion
Given the points raised, the program can incorrectly handle cases where there are obstacles directly in the path of the grasshopper, even if the conditions regarding distance modulo `k` are satisfied.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:

If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k`, and all characters at the positions `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` for `i` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` are not '#', then 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.

If either `g` or `t` is -1, the output is 'NO'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
