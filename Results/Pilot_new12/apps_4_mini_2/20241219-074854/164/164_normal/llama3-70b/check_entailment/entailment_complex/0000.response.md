The program overall meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of how the program follows the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads two integers, `n` and `k`, followed by a string `s` that represents the cells. This matches the problem description that specifies how the input will be provided.

2. **Finding Positions of `G` and `T`**: The program locates the indices of `G` and `T` within the string `s`. It assigns these indices to `g` and `t` respectively. If either character is missing (which won't happen as per the problem description), it correctly prints `'NO'`.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The program checks if the absolute difference between the indices of `G` and `T` (i.e., `abs(t - g)`) is divisible by `k`. This condition is necessary to ensure that the grasshopper can reach the target using jumps of length `k`.

4. **Obstacle Check**: The program verifies that there are no obstacles (`'#'`) in the path by checking all positions `(g + i * k) % n` for `i` in the range from `0` to `abs(t - g) // k`. This effectively ensures that all cells that the grasshopper would land on during the jumps are free of obstacles.

5. **Result Output**: Finally, it prints `'YES'` if both conditions (distance divisible by `k` and no obstacles in the path) are satisfied, otherwise it prints `'NO'`. 

Thus, the function adheres to the logic and requirements specified in the problem description by ensuring both the mathematical conditions (reachable distance) and the physical constraints (obstacle avoidance) are satisfied before determining if the grasshopper can reach the insect.

Given that the program is structured to evaluate all the conditions as specified and handle valid inputs correctly, I conclude that it correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
