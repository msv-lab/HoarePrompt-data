Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully adhere to the problem description due to the following issues:

1. **Modulo Misuse**: The program uses the expression `(g + i * k) % n` to check the positions the grasshopper can reach. In this problem, the grasshopper cannot wrap around the array of cells because it can only jump to cells that are specifically k cells away. If the grasshopper starts at index `g` and jumps towards a positive index, it should not use modulo to consider wrapping around the end of the string. Thus this potentially allows for incorrectly accessing an index which ought to be out of bounds based on the valid jumping rules.

2. **Jump Validation Logic**: The check `all(s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))` needs to ensure that any calculated position is within bounds (from 0 to n-1) before checking for the absence of '#'. An out-of-bounds index can lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results.

3. **Output Messages**: The problem description specifies that the output should be "YES" or "NO" (uppercase) while the provided implementation uses a lowercase 'yes' or 'no'. Although this doesn't affect the logic per se, it leads to failure in correctly meeting the output format as stated in the problem description.

Due to these reasons, the program might return incorrect results for certain inputs, failing to satisfy the requirements of the problem description accurately.
