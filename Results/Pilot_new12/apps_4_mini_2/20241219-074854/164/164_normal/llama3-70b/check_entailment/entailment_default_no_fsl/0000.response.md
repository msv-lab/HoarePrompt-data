Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for checking the cells between the grasshopper's starting position 'G' and the target 'T' is flawed. The condition used in this line:

```python
all((s[(g + i * k) % n] != '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))
```

determines if the grasshopper can jump to the target cell by checking every k-th cell between 'G' and 'T'. However, it relies on the modulo operation, which does not account for the direction of the jump (left or right). For instance, if 'G' is before 'T' and there are obstacles in-between, or if 'G' is after 'T', it may incorrectly evaluate a path that cannot be taken.

For example, in the input:

```
7 3
T..#..G
```

The expected output is "NO", since there is an obstacle preventing direct access between 'G' and 'T'. However, the calculation of indices does not ensure that all intervening cells are correctly validated. The modulo operation can yield incorrect index calculations when determining if the path is blocked or not.

Additionally, the edge case where 'G' and 'T' are the same position should print "YES", but the current program will print "NO" because the absolute difference is zero, and the conditions might not satisfy all requirements for other cases that validly utilize jumps.

Thus, the program fails to account for scenarios where obstacles block jumps, leading to incorrect outputs for certain configurations that it should handle per the problem description, demonstrating that it does not correctly determine the feasibility of the grasshopper's path in every potential case.
