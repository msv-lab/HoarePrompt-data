Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `s` is an input string, the index `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` or -1 if 'G' did not occur, the index `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` or -1 if 'T' did not occur. Either the index `g` is -1, indicating that 'G' did not occur in `s`, or the index `t` is -1, indicating that 'T' did not occur in `s`.***
