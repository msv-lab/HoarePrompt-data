The value of `t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `s` is an input string, and `t` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `s` is an input string, `t` is 1**.
