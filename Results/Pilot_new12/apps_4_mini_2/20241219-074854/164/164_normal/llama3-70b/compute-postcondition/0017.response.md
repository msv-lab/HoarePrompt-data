In this code snippet, `g` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is specifically mentioned as 2. Other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`) are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is 2.**
