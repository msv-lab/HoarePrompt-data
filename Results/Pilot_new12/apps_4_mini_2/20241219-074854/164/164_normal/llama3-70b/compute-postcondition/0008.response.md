The variable `t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer based on input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', and the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer based on input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G', and the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T'.**
