Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, and `s` is an input string. If the character at index `i` of `s` is 'G', then `g` is set to 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is 'T', then `t` is set to 2. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.***
