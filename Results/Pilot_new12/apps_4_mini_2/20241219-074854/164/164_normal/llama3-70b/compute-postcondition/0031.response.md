The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `line`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the length of the string. `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, which serves as a stepping distance. The string `line` has a length of `n` and contains exactly one 'G', one 'T', with the remaining characters being either '.' (representing empty cells) or '#' (representing obstacles). 

The function evaluates the path from 'G' to 'T' based on the value of `k`. It returns different outputs based on the viability of the path:
- Case_1: If there are no obstacles ('#') in the path between 'G' and 'T' when stepping `k` steps at a time, the function returns "Yes".
- Case_2: If an obstacle is encountered at any stepping position from 'G' to 'T', the function returns "No".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to determine if it is possible to move from the position marked by 'G' to the position marked by 'T' using steps of size `k`, while avoiding obstacles. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, and a string line. It returns "Yes" if a path from 'G' to 'T' can be made without hitting obstacles, and "No" if the path encounters any obstacles.**
