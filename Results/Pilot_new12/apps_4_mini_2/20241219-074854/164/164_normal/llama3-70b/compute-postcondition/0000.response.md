The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from the `input()` function, which accepts two space-separated integers, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous states of `n` and `k` were known to be within specified ranges: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. However, the specific values of `n` and `k` are now defined based on user input, which can vary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `k` is an integer based on input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1.**
