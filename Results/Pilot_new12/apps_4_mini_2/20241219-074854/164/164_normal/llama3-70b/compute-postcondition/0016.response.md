According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, and `s` is an input string.**
