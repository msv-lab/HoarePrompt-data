According to the code, the execution of the loop is dependent on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer within the range of 2 to 100 (inclusive), the loop will always execute at least twice (for `i` equal to 0 and 1) because the range function generates values from 0 up to, but not including, `n`.

The state values `g` and `t` being -1 are irrelevant for the loop's execution because they do not influence the iteration controlled by `i`. Therefore, the critical variables for adjusting the state are `n` as it establishes the number of iterations and `i`, which will start at 0.

- Before the loop begins, `i` will initialize at 0 (the starting point of the range).
- The value of `n` guarantees that the loop will execute (as its minimum value is 2).

Thus, the adjusted states before the loop executes would be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer based on input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is -1**
