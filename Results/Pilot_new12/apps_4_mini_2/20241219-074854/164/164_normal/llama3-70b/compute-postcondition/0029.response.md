Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` which is not -1, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` which is not -1. If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k`, and all characters at the positions `(g + i * k) % n` in `s` for `i` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` are not '#', then 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.***
