Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` which is not -1, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` which is not -1. The absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k`, and for every index in the range from `g` to `t`, the corresponding characters in `s` at positions `(g + i * k) % n` are not '#' for all integers `i` such that 0 ≤ `i ≤ abs(t - g) // k`.***
