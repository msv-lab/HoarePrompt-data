Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `s` is an input string. If either `g` or `t` is -1, the output is 'NO'. If both `g` and `t` are valid indices (not -1), and the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k`, and all characters at the positions `(g + i * k) % n` for `i` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` in `s` are not '#', then 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
