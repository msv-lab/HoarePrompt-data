In the given code, the variables `g` and `t` are assigned the value of -1. These variables were neither previously defined nor affect any conditions or calculations involving `n`, `k`, or `s`. Since the values of `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged, we can summarize the state of the variables after the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `k` is an integer based on input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; `s` is an input string; `g` is -1, `t` is -1.**
