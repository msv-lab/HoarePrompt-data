To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we first note that the loop iterates over the indices of the string `s`, which has a length of `n`. During each iteration, it checks if the character at the current index is either 'G' or 'T' and updates the variables `g` and `t` accordingly. If neither character is found, `g` and `t` retain their values of -1.

The final values of `g` and `t` depend on the occurrence of 'G' and 'T' in the string `s`. 

- If 'G' is found at some index, `g` will be set to that index. If 'G' is not found at all, `g` will remain -1.
- Similarly, if 'T' is found at some index, `t` will be set to that index. If 'T' is not found, `t` will remain -1.

Since the loop always executes exactly `n` times (given `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`), the state after all iterations will reflect the final values of `g` and `t` based on the presence or absence of 'G' and 'T' in the string `s`.

Considering all possible scenarios, we can summarize the states as follows:

If 'G' and 'T' are both present in the input string `s`, the values of `g` and `t` will reflect the last position where each character was found within the first `n` characters of the string. 
If neither 'G' nor 'T' is present, `g` and `t` will remain -1.

Thus, we can conclusively say:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s`, or -1 if 'G' did not occur, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s`, or -1 if 'T' did not occur.**
