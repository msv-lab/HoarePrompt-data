The code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' but does not modify any variables. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `g`, and `t` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions provided. Therefore, the Output State includes the unchanged variables along with an indication of the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `s` is an input string, the index `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` or -1 if 'G' did not occur, the index `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` or -1 if 'T' did not occur, output is 'NO'**.
