The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts input from the user. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `s` is now an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `k` is an integer based on input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; `s` is an input string.**
