The variable `g` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently `0`. Other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `g` while preserving the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer based on input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is 0, `t` is -1. The current value of `s[i]` is 'G'.**
