Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, and `t` is -1 initially. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is updated to 0, while `g` remains -1, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G'.***
