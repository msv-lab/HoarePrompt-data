Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1`, and `s` is an input string. If `s[i]` is 'G', then `g` is updated to 0 and `t` remains -1. If `s[i]` is 'T', then `t` is updated to 0, while `g` remains -1. If `s[i]` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then both `g` and `t` remain -1.***
