    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; if `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, then -1 has been printed; otherwise, `res` is equal to the total number of unsuccessful operations, and `dx` and `dy` represent the remaining distances to reach 'R' and 'U' respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n`, a string of operations containing the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net effective movement along the 'U' and 'D' axes (vertical) as well as the 'R' and 'L' axes (horizontal) based on the given operations. It then determines the remaining distance needed to reach the target coordinates starting from (x, y). If the required movements in any direction to reach the target coordinates (given by `dx` and `dy`) are negative, it prints -1 indicating that it's impossible to reach the target. Otherwise, it counts how many operations in the given sequence were ineffective in reducing the distance to the target and prints that count (stored in `res`). Hence, the final output is either -1 or the total number of unsuccessful operations. Edge cases such as all operations leading away from the target are handled by checking the distances before counting ineffective operations. The function does not return values but instead prints the results.
