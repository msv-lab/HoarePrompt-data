You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and identify any potential shortcomings or unhandled cases. Let's break down the requirements and the code itself.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The robot starts at (0, 0) and follows a sequence of operations consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'.
2. We need to determine the minimum length of the subsegment of the operation sequence that can be changed to ensure the robot ends up at (x, y).
3. If it's impossible to reach (x, y) with any modifications, output -1.
4. If no changes are needed to already reach (x, y), output 0.

### Code Analysis:
1. The code reads the required number of operations and the operation string.
2. It computes the final position of the robot after executing the given operations.
3. The code calculates `dx` and `dy`, which represent how far off the robot is in the x and y directions compared to the target coordinates (x, y).
4. If either `dx` or `dy` is negative, it indicates that it's impossible to reach the desired coordinates because we can't "unmove" in a direction that wasn't originally taken.
5. The code then loops through the operation sequence to determine changes needed to align the robot's final position with (x, y) and counts how many operations need to be changed.

### Potential Issues:
Let's look for edge cases where this logic might fail:
- Scenario when the current distances (`dx`, `dy`) are zero, but still not matching (x, y), which happens after the first loop and isn't clearly handled.
- If the sequence has exact matches for operations that need replacement but fails to account for operations already directing towards the target after modifications.

### Example Case:
Consider the case where:
```
Input:
5
RULUU
1 2
```
In this case:
- The robot moves: (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2).
- The required endpoint (1, 2) is achieved with the operations.
- The expected output is `0` because no changes are needed.

Now check the program execution:
- Final coordinates calculated would be (1, 2), matching the input (1, 2).
- As per the code, no movement logic will count changed segments.

However, it's clear based on potential flaws in the handling:
- The algorithm does not correctly account situations where direct movements already lead to the target, or mismatched expected `dx` and `dy` with operations still being possible unexplored.

### Conclusion:
While the program functions effectively for single cases identified, it does not robustly handle every possible input and can yield incorrect outputs in cases where it should report no changes are necessary. 

**Correctness: False** 

The program can fail in determining no operations are necessary correctly or handle out-of-scope operations effectively leading to incorrect outputs in corner cases and needs adjustments for a broad range of inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n`, a string of operations containing the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net effective movement along the 'U' and 'D' axes (vertical) as well as the 'R' and 'L' axes (horizontal) based on the given operations. It then determines the remaining distance needed to reach the target coordinates starting from (x, y). If the required movements in any direction to reach the target coordinates (given by `dx` and `dy`) are negative, it prints -1 indicating that it's impossible to reach the target. Otherwise, it counts how many operations in the given sequence were ineffective in reducing the distance to the target and prints that count (stored in `res`). Hence, the final output is either -1 or the total number of unsuccessful operations. Edge cases such as all operations leading away from the target are handled by checking the distances before counting ineffective operations. The function does not return values but instead prints the results.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
