You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the given Python function according to the problem description, let's break down the logic in the provided program.

### Overview of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of operations (`n`), the sequence of operations (`ops`), and the target coordinates (`x`, `y`).
2. **Final Position Calculation**: It calculates the final position `(ux, uy)` after executing the operations.
3. **Difference Calculation**: The program computes `dx` and `dy`, which represent how many horizontal and vertical moves are needed to reach the target coordinates `(x, y)`.
4. **Impossible Situations Handling**: If `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, it prints `-1`, indicating that it’s impossible to reach the target.
5. **Change Calculation**: It counts how many changes are needed in the operations to make the robot end at `(x, y)`.

### Logical Errors in the Program
1. **Checking Feasibility**: The logic to determine if reaching the target is possible only checks for negative values of `dx` and `dy`. However, it does not consider whether we have enough moves available in either direction. For example, if `dx` (right moves needed) is positive but the sequence does not have enough `R` moves to support that, it is still impossible.
2. **Counting Changes**: The counting of changes only considers whether a matching operation exists and adds to the change count if it doesn’t. This may inaccurately assess necessary changes, especially if excess moves in one direction are encountered which cannot be transformed to the other direction because they don't match the need.

### Potential Incorrect Example
1. **Edge Case**: Consider the case:
   - Input:
     ```
     5
     UUUUU
     0 1
     ```
   - Expected output: `-1` because only vertical moves `U` exist, which cannot reach `(0, 1)` if `dx` is `0` and `dy` needs to be `1`.
   - Actual output: The code would reach the line calculating `dx` and `dy` yielding `0` and `-4`, eventually resulting in `print(-1)` but the mechanism leading to that is incorrectly assumed due to the pre-check of `dx` and `dy` values. It is logically unsound.

Given these points, the program does not correctly address the problem description in every situation, especially where the required number of moves should be accounted for rather than just checking for the presence of moves in a string.

### Conclusion on Correctness
Based on the identified flaws, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, the sequence of operations is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and x and y are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    ux, uy, lx, ly = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `ux` is equal to the number of 'R' minus the number of 'L'; `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' minus the number of 'D'; `ops` is a string consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' of length `n`.
    dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy
    if (dx < 0 or dy < 0) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is equal to the total number of unsuccessful operations, `dx` is equal to the remaining distance to reach 'R', `dy` is equal to the remaining distance to reach 'U', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000.
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; if `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, then -1 has been printed; otherwise, `res` is equal to the total number of unsuccessful operations, and `dx` and `dy` represent the remaining distances to reach 'R' and 'U' respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n`, a string of operations containing the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net effective movement along the 'U' and 'D' axes (vertical) as well as the 'R' and 'L' axes (horizontal) based on the given operations. It then determines the remaining distance needed to reach the target coordinates starting from (x, y). If the required movements in any direction to reach the target coordinates (given by `dx` and `dy`) are negative, it prints -1 indicating that it's impossible to reach the target. Otherwise, it counts how many operations in the given sequence were ineffective in reducing the distance to the target and prints that count (stored in `res`). Hence, the final output is either -1 or the total number of unsuccessful operations. Edge cases such as all operations leading away from the target are handled by checking the distances before counting ineffective operations. The function does not return values but instead prints the results.
