Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` > 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1 and `res` remains 0. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is negative, then `dx` is increased by 1 and `res` remains 0. Otherwise, `res` is set to 1, `dx` is adjusted accordingly, and `dy` is modified as per the next operation in `ops`.***
