Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is negative, `dx` is increased by 1, and `res` remains 0 for the next operation. Otherwise, `dy` is adjusted depending on the last operation, `dx` is adjusted according to the last operation, `res` is now set to 1, and `op` remains the next operation in the `ops` list, which has at least one more element remaining.***
