The value of `uy` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `op`, and `index`) remain unchanged and are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000 and must be greater than `i + 1`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `op` is the character at `ops[i + 1]`, `index` is `i + 1`, and `uy` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000 and must be greater than `i + 1`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `op` is the character at `ops[i + 1]`, `index` is `i + 1`, `uy` is increased by 1**.
