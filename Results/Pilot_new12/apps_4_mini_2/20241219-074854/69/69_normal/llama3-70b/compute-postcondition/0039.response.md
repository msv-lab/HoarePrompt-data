Let's analyze the impact of the code provided.

The code line `dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy` calculates the values of `dx` and `dy`. 

- `ux` is defined as the number of 'R' minus the number of 'L',
- `uy` is defined as the number of 'U' minus the number of 'D'.

The values of `dx` and `dy` will be determined by subtracting `ux` and `uy` from some variables `x` and `y`, respectively.

Since we don't have specific values for `x` and `y` provided in the initial state, we can only state that `dx` will equal `x - ux` and `dy` will equal `y - uy`. 
Given that `n` is a positive integer in the range of `1` to `200000`, `ux` and `uy` will depend on the specific operations counted in the string `ops`.

No other variables from the initial state are specifically altered in this code line, so we need to include all relevant information.

Thus, the output state after running the code will reflect the newly calculated values for `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `ux` is equal to the number of 'R' minus the number of 'L'; `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' minus the number of 'D'; `dx` is equal to `x - ux`; `dy` is equal to `y - uy`.**
