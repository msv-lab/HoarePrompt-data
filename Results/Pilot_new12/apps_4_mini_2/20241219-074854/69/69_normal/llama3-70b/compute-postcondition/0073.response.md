The value of `dy` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `dy` is unknown, so it decreases to `dy - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `op` is the next operation in `ops`; `dy` is adjusted to `dy - 1`; `dx` is adjusted accordingly; `res` remains 0.**
