Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `ops` is a string of length `n`; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; if `op` is 'U', then `y` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `op` has been updated to the character at the next index in `ops` (with `index` incremented to `i + 1`); if `op` is 'D', `y` is decremented by 1; if `op` is 'R', `x` is incremented by 1; if `op` is 'L', `x` is decremented by 1; if `op` is neither 'R' nor 'L', the value of `x` remains unchanged.***
