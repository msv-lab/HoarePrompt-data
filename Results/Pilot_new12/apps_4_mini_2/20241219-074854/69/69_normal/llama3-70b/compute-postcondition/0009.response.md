The value of `uy` is decremented by 1. The other variables, including `n`, `ops`, `x`, `lx`, `ly`, and `ux`, remain unchanged. Since `uy` starts at 0, its new value will be -1. The other precondition details remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `ux` is 0, `uy` is -1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, and the value of `op` equals 'D'.**
