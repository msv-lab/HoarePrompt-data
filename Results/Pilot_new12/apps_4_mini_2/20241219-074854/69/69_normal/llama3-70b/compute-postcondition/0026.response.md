Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, and `y` is an integer. If `op` is equal to 'R', `ux` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `op` is equal to 'L', `ux` is decremented by 1; if `op` is neither 'R' nor 'L', the value of `ux` remains unchanged.***
