Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `ops` is a string of length `n`; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; `op` is the character at the next index in `ops`; `index` has been incremented to `i + 1`. If `op` is 'D', then `y` has decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is incremented by 1; if `op` is 'L', then `x` is decremented by 1; if `op` is neither 'R' nor 'L', then the value of `x` remains unchanged.***
