The value of `dy` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `n`, `dx`, `res`, `op`, and `ops` remains unchanged as only `dy` is affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `dy` is incremented by 1; `dx` is adjusted depending on the last operation; `res` remains 0 for the next operation; `op` is the next operation in the `ops` list; `ops` has at least one more element remaining.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `dy` is incremented by 1; `dx` is adjusted depending on the last operation; `res` remains 0 for the next operation; `op` is the next operation in the `ops` list; `ops` has at least one more element remaining.**
