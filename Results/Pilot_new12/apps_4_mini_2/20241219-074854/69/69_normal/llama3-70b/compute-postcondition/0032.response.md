The code increments the value of `ux` by 1. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `op`, and `index` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated output state will reflect the increment of `ux`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000 and must be greater than `i + 1`; `x` remains unchanged; `y` remains unchanged; `op` is the character at `ops[i + 1]`; `index` is `i + 1`; `ux` is incremented by 1.**
