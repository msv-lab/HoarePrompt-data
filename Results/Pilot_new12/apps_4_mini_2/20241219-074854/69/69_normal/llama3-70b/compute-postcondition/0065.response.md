The value of `dx` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables `n`, `dy`, `res`, `op`, and `ops` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `dy` is adjusted depending on the last operation; `dx` is decreased by 1; `res` remains 0 for the next operation; `op` is the next operation in the `ops` list; `ops` has at least one more element remaining.**
