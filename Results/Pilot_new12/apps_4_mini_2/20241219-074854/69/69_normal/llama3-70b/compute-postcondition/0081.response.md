Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000. If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decreased by 1, `dx` is adjusted accordingly, and `res` remains 0. Otherwise, if `op` is 'D' and `dy` is negative, then `dy` is increased by 1 while `dx` is adjusted accordingly and `res` remains 0. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1 and `res` remains 0. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is negative, then `dx` is increased by 1 and `res` remains 0. In all other cases, `res` is set to 1, `dx` is adjusted accordingly, and `dy` is modified based on the next operation in `ops`.***
