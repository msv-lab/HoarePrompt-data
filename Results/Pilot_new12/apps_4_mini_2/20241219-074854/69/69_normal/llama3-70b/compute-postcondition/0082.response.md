Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `ux` is equal to the number of 'R' minus the number of 'L'; `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' minus the number of 'D'; `dx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dy` is greater than or equal to 0; `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`; `res` is 0.

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000. If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decremented by 1, and `res` remains 0, with `ops` having at least 1 element. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1, `dy` remains equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is 0, with `ops` having at least 1 element. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is set to 0, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, and `res` remains 0. In all other cases, `dy` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dx` remains greater than or equal to 0, with `dx` equal to `x - ux`, `dy` equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1, with `ops` must have at least 1 element, either `op` is 'D' or `dy` is greater than 0, and `op` is either 'L' or 'R'.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000. If one of the operations modifies `dy` or `dx`, while `res` remains 0, the same conditions as previously apply for the next operation. If none of the directions can be executed due to the constraints on `dy` and `dx`, then `res` is incremented based on the last operation.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000. Each operation is evaluated with the current values of `dy` and `dx`, adjusting them as per the rules of the operations; if none apply, `res` may increment as necessitated by the constraints.

Output State after all iterations of the loop: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000. The values of `dx` and `dy` are adjusted based on the operations performed in `ops`, where `dx` represents how many more 'R' are required, `dy` indicates how many more 'U' are required, and all valid operations are exhausted. `res` is equal to the count of operations that did not succeed due to the bounds of `dx` and `dy`. 

Output State: **`res` is equal to the total number of unsuccessful operations, `dx` is equal to the remaining distance to reach 'R', `dy` is equal to the remaining distance to reach 'U', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000.**
