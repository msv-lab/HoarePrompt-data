Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is 0, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, and `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, while `res` remains 0. Otherwise, `dx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, with `dx` equal to `x - ux`, `dy` equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1. Additionally, `ops` must have at least 1 element, and either `op` is 'D' or `dy` is greater than 0, with `op` being either 'L' or 'R', while `dx` remains greater than or equal to 0.***
