The value of `ux` is decremented by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer in the range from 1 to 200000, and other variables such as `ops`, `x`, `y`, and `op` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State will include the updated value for `ux`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `op` is the character at the next index in `ops`, index is incremented to `i + 1`, `ux` is decremented by 1.**
