The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the result of `map(int, input().split())`. Since `x` and `y` are being reassigned new integer values from the input, the initial constraints on `x` and `y` remain valid, but their specific values now depend on user input. The values of `n` and `ops` are unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000; `ops` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer.**
