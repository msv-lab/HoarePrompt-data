The value of `dy` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `dy` is not specified. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `op` is the next operation in `ops`; `dy` is increased by 1; `dx` adjusted accordingly; `res` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `op` is the next operation in `ops`; `dy` is increased by 1; `dx` adjusted accordingly; `res` remains 0**.
