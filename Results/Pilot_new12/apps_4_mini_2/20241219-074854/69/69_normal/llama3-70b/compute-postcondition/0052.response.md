Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000, `ux` is equal to the number of 'R' minus the number of 'L', `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' minus the number of 'D', `dx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, `dx` is equal to `x - ux` and now `dx` is decreased by 1, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `res` is 0, and `ops` must have at least 1 element, either `op` is 'D' or `dy` is not less than or equal to 0, and `op` is 'R' while `dx` is now greater than or equal to 0.**
