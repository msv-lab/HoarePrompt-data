Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000 and must be greater than `i + 1`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `op` is the character at `ops[i + 1]`, and `index` is `i + 1`. If `op` is 'D', then `uy` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `op` is equal to 'R', then `ux` is incremented by 1; if `op` is equal to 'L', then `ux` is decreased by 1.***
