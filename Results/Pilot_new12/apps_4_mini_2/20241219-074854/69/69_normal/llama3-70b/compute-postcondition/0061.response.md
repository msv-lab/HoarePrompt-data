Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000. If `op` is 'U' and `dy` is greater than 0, then `dy` is decremented by 1, and `res` remains 0, with `ops` having at least 1 element. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1, `dy` remains equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is 0, with `ops` having at least 1 element. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is set to 0, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, and `res` remains 0. In all other cases, `dx` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dy` remains greater than or equal to 0, with `dx` equal to `x - ux`, `dy` equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1, where `ops` must have at least 1 element, either `op` is 'D' or `dy` is greater than 0, and `op` is either 'L' or 'R'.***
