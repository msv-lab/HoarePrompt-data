The code `print(res)` outputs the value of `res`, which is equal to the total number of unsuccessful operations. However, the state of `res` itself does not change as a result of this statement. The other variables (`dx`, `dy`, and `n`) remain unaffected as well.

Output State: **`res` is equal to the total number of unsuccessful operations, `dx` is equal to the remaining distance to reach 'R', `dy` is equal to the remaining distance to reach 'U', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000.**
