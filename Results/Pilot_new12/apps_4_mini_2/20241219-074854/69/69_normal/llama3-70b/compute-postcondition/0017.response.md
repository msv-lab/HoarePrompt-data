Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000 and `ops` is a string of length `n`. If `op` is equal to 'R', `ux` is set to 1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0. If `op` is not equal to 'D' and `op` is equal to 'L', then `ux` is set to -1, `uy` is 0, `lx` is 0, and `ly` is 0.***
