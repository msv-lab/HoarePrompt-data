The variable `res` is assigned the value of 0. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state remains unchanged for them. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `ux` is equal to the number of 'R' minus the number of 'L'; `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' minus the number of 'D'; `dx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dy` is greater than or equal to 0; `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`; `res` is 0.**
