The value of `dx` is incremented by 1. The other variables retain their values as specified in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `op` is the next operation in `ops`; `dy` is adjusted accordingly; `dx` is increased by 1; `res` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; `op` is the next operation in `ops`; `dy` is adjusted accordingly; `dx` is increased by 1; `res` remains 0**.
