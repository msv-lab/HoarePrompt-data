The value of `dx` is increased by 1. Initially, it is specified that the current value of `dx` is less than 0, and after the increment, `dx` will be equal to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000, `ux` is equal to the number of 'R' minus the number of 'L', `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' minus the number of 'D', `dx` becomes 0, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `res` is 0, `ops` must have at least 1 element, `op` is 'L', and the current value of `dx` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000, `ux` is equal to the number of 'R' minus the number of 'L', `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' minus the number of 'D', `dx` is 0, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `res` is 0, `ops` must have at least 1 element, `op` is 'L'.**
