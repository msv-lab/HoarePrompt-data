The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` was 0, so after the operation, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000, `op` is the next operation in `ops`, `dy` adjusted accordingly, `dx` adjusted accordingly, `res` is 1**
