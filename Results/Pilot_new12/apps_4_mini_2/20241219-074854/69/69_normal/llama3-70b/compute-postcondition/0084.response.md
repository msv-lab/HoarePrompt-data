Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000; if `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, then -1 has been printed; otherwise, `res` is equal to the total number of unsuccessful operations, and `dx` and `dy` represent the remaining distances to reach 'R' and 'U' respectively.***
