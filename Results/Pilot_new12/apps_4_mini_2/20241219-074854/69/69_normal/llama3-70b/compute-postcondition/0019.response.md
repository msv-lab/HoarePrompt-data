Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, and `y` is an integer. If `op` is equal to 'U', then `uy` is set to 1, while `ux`, `lx`, and `ly` remain 0. If `op` is not equal to 'U', `ux` remains 0, `ly` remains 0, and if `op` equals 'D', then `uy` is set to -1. If `op` equals 'R', then `ux` is set to 1 and `uy` is set to 0. If `op` equals 'L', then `ux` is set to -1 and `uy` is set to 0.***
