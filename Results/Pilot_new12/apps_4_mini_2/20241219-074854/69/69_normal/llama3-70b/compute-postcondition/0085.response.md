The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 200000; `operations`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'; and `x` and `y`, which are integers constrained between -10^9 and 10^9. 

The function processes the input `operations` in relation to the starting coordinates defined by `x` and `y`. It performs movements based on the characters in the `operations` string. The function ultimately returns the final coordinates after executing all operations.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), operations (a string of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'), and x, y (integers). It returns the final coordinates after applying the movements defined by the operations string starting from the coordinates (x, y).**
