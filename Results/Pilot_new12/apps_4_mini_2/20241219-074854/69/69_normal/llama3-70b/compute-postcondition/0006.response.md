The variable `uy` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the previous value of `uy`, but it is initialized to 0. After executing the code, `uy` will have the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is equal to 'U'.**
