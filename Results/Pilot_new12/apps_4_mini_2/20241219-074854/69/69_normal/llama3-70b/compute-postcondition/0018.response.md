Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `ux` is 0, `ly` is 0, and the value of `op` is not equal to 'U'. If `op` equals 'D', then `uy` is set to -1. Otherwise, if `op` equals 'R', `ux` is set to 1 and `uy` is set to 0. If `op` is not equal to 'D' and `op` is equal to 'L', then `ux` is set to -1 and `uy` is set to 0. In every case, `lx` remains 0.***
