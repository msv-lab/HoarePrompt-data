The value of `ops` is assigned from user input, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. The other variables remain unchanged as the operation only affects `ops`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `ops` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, and `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= y <= 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000; `ops` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'; `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9; `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= y <= 10^9.**
