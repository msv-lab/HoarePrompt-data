The variable `uy` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `ops`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `uy` is now `uy + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `uy` is now `uy + 1`.**
