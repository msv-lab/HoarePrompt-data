The value of `uy` is decremented by 1. Other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the only variable affected is `uy`, which will now be `uy - 1`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `op`, and `index` remain constant. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 200000 and must be greater than `i + 1`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `op` is the character at `ops[i + 1]`, `index` is `i + 1`, `uy` is decreased by 1.**
