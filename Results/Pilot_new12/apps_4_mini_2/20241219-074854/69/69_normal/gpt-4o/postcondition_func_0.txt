The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n`, a string `operations` of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the final net positions derived from the movements specified in `operations` and checks the distance between these final positions and the provided integers `x` and `y`. If the final net position from the movements matches the provided position `(x, y)`, the function returns 0. If there are matching positions throughout the operation sequence, it returns the minimum distance between any matching positions. If no such positions are found, it returns -1. The function handles cases where the operations string is empty, resulting in a return of -1 if `(x, y)` is not also at (0,0), and it efficiently tracks previously encountered positions to determine the minimum distance only when necessary.
