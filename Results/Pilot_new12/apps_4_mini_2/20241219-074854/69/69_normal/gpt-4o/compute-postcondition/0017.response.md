Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer within -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an integer within -10^9 to 10^9. If `op` is 'U', then `final_y` is 1 and `final_x` is 0. If `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is -1 and `final_x` is 0. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is -1 and `final_y` is 0. Otherwise, if `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is 1 and `final_y` is 0.***
