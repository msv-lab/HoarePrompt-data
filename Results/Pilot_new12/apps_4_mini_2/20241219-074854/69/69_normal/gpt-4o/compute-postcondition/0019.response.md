The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` is still a positive integer and does not affect the other variables. Thus, the only change is to `final_y`. 

Output State: **`n` is still a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_y` is increased by 1.**
