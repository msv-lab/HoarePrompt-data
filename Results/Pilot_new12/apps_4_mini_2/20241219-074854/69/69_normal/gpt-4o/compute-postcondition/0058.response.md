Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', and `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D'. If the current operation is 'R', then `current_x` is updated to 1 while `current_y` remains 0, and all other preconditions hold true.***
