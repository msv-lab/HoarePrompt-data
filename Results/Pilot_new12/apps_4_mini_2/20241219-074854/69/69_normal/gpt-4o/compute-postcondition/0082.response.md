`current_y` is decremented by 1, which changes its value. Since `current_y` can be either 1, -1, or 0, the new possible values for `current_y` are 0, -2, or -1 respectively. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state indicates that `current_y` has been adjusted accordingly.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `current_x` is either 0, -1, or 1, `current_y` is either 0, -2, or -1, and `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is now equal to `i + 1`.**
