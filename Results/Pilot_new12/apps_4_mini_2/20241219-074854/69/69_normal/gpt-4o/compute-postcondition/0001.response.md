The variable `final_y` is assigned the value 0 explicitly, but it previously was not defined and thus assumed to have no value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `final_x`) remain unaffected in this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0.**
