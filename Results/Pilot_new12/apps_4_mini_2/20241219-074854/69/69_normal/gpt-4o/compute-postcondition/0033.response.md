Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` and `y` are the updated values considering the last operation. If the last operation `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decremented by 1 and `i` is the previous value of `i + 1`. If the last operation `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is increased by 1 and `i` is updated to `i + 1`.***
