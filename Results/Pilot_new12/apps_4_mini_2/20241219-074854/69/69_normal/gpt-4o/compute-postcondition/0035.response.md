Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, if `op` is 'U', `i` is incremented by 1 and `final_y` is updated to `final_y + 1`. If `op` is 'D', `final_y` is decremented by 1, `x` and `y` are updated values, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'L', `final_x` is decremented by 1 and `i` remains as `i + 1`. If `op` is 'R', `final_x` is incremented by 1 and `i` is updated to `i + 1.***
