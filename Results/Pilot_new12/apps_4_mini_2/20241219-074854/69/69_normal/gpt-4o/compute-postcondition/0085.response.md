Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', and `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`. If the operation at index `i` is 'R', then `current_x` can be either 1, 0, or 2, and `current_y` can be either 1, -1, or 0. The position_map at `(current_x, current_y)` is updated to `i + 1`.***
