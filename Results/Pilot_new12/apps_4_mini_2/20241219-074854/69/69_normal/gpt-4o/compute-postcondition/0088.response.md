Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, and `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is updated to `i + 1`. If the operation at index `i` is 'U', then `current_x` is either 0, -1, or 1, and `current_y` can be either 2, 0, or 1. If the operation at index `i` is 'D', then `current_x` can be either 0, -1, or 1, and `current_y` can be either 0, -2, or -1. If the operation is 'L', then `current_x` is now -1, 0, or -2, while `current_y` remains either 1, -1, or 0. If the operation is 'R', then `current_x` can be 1, 0, or 2, while `current_y` can be either 1, -1, or 0, ensuring that `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is updated to `i + 1`.***
