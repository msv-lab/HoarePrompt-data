The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, a string `operations`, and two integers `x` and `y`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer with a value between 1 and 200000. The string `operations` consists of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' with a length equal to `n`. The integers `x` and `y` can take values in the range from -10^9 to 10^9. After executing the function, the function has two possible return cases: 

- Case 1: The program returns 0.
- Case 2: It returns `min_length` if it's not equal to float('inf'), indicating that a matching position was found; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating no matching positions were found.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the operations based on the input parameters and return either 0 or a minimum length of a matching position or -1 if no matching positions are found. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n, a string operations of length n consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', and two integers x and y, returning 0 or the minimum length of a matching position, or -1 if no matching positions are found.**
