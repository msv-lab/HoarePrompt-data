Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `current_x` remains 0, `current_y` remains 0, `min_length` is equal to float('inf'), `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1}, with `n` greater than 0 and `i` equal to 0. The `target_pos` is present in the `position_map`.***
