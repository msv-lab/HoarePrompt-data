Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `current_x` is either 1, 0, or 2, `current_y` is either 1, -1, or 0, and `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is now equal to `i + 1`.**
