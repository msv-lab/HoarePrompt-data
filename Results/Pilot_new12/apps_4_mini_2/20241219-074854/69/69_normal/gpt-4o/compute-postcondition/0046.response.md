To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop variable `i` and the condition regarding `n`. 

The loop statement indicates that it will execute `n` times. The following variables and conditions need to be assessed for the execution of the loop:

1. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not enter at all.
2. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 before the first iteration of the loop. It will later increment with each iteration.

Therefore, in order for the for loop to execute, we must ensure that `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, for the first execution, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`, `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`, at least one of the following is true: `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, `min_length` is equal to float('inf'), `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
