Postcondition: ***Given `final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', and `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`. If the operation at index `i` is 'D', then `current_x` can be either 0, -1, or 1, `current_y` can be either 0, -2, or -1, and `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is updated to `i + 1`. Otherwise, if the operation is 'L', `current_x` is now -1, 0, or -2, ensuring `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` remains as `i + 1`. If the operation is 'R', then `current_x` can be either 1, 0, or 2, while `current_y` can still be either 1, -1, or 0, with `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` updated to `i + 1` in this case as well.***
