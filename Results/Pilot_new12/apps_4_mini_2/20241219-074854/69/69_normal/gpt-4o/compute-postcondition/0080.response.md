To determine the adjustment of states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the information given and the loop structure:

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `n`.
2. The variable `i` is used as the loop index and is incremented automatically with each iteration.

From the provided state:
- `final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements (`R` minus `L`).
- `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements (`U` minus `D`).
- `target_pos` is calculated based on `current_x` and `current_y` with offsets of `dx` and `dy`.
- `current_x` can be one of the values: 0, -1, or 1.
- `current_y` can be one of the values: 1, -1, or 0.
- `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is currently equal to `i`, indicating that `i` corresponds to the current position on the map.

For the loop to continue executing, `i` needs to be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has its value set in `position_map` and it will automatically increment by 1 for the next iteration.

Given there is no further information about the prior value of `i`, we will assume it can be adjusted to prepare for an additional iteration.

To be ready for another iteration:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The new state must maintain that `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` would be equal to the new value of `i`.

If `i` was the last used index in `position_map`, then it will be adjusted to `i + 1` for the next output.

Thus, for the next iteration to execute successfully:
- `i` must be less than `n`, so if `i` is currently `i`, we will set it to `i + 1` and ensure `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `current_x` is either 0, -1, or 1, `current_y` is either 1, -1, or 0, and `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is now equal to `i + 1`**
