The only effect of the code `final_y -= 1` is to decrement `final_y` by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown, but since `final_y` exists in the initial state, we can infer that it will now hold one less than its previous value. The values of the other variables (`n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged as they are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is still a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_y` is one less than its previous value.**
