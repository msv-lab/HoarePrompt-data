Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D'. If the current operation is 'D', then `current_y` is updated to -1 while `current_x` remains 0. If the current operation is 'L', then `current_x` is updated to -1 while `current_y` remains 0. If the current operation is 'R', then `current_x` is updated to 1 while `current_y` remains 0. In all cases, at least one of the following is true: `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, `min_length` is equal to float('inf'), and `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1}, with `n` greater than 0 and `i` equal to 0.***
