Based on the provided information, `target_pos` is assigned the value of `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`. The values of `current_x` and `current_y` will determine the new value of `target_pos`.

In the initial state:
- If `operations[i]` is 'U', then `current_x` is 0 and `current_y` is 1 (since it changes to 1).
- If `operations[i]` is 'D', then `current_x` is -1 and `current_y` is -1.
- If `operations[i]` is 'L', then `current_x` is -1 and `current_y` remains 0.
- If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` becomes 1 while `current_y` remains 0.

Since `operations[i]` is not specifically provided, I will assume a general scenario. Regardless, since `target_pos` depends on constants `dx` and `dy`, but these values aren't defined here, I will denote their existence symbolically.

Thus, for `target_pos`, I will write in terms of `current_x`, `dx`, `current_y`, and `dy` where the values of `current_x` and `current_y` remain the same as specified in the state, leading to a valid condition based on the operations performed.

Updating the output state based on the derived value for `target_pos` and the other unchanged variables, we get:
Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `current_x` is either 0, -1, or 1, and `current_y` is either 1, -1, or 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): 0}, `min_length` is now 1, and `n` is greater than 1 with `i` equal to 1.**
