Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `current_x` remains 0, `current_y` is now 1, `position_map` is {(0, 0): 0}, `min_length` is now 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
