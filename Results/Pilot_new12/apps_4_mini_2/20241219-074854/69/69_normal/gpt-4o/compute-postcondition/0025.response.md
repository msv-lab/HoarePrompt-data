Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, and `y` is an integer. If `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is one less than its previous value. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1; if `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `final_x` remains unchanged.***
