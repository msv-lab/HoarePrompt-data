Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, if `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is decremented by 1, `x` and `y` are the updated values considering the last operation, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decremented by 1 and `i` remains the previous value of `i + 1. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is incremented by 1 and `i` is updated to `i + 1.***
