The value of `current_x` is decreased by 1. Since `current_x` can be either 0, -1, or 1, the new value of `current_x` would be either -1, -2, or 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

So the output state is: `final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `current_y` is either 1, -1, or 0, `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is now equal to `i + 1`, and `current_x` is now -1, 0, or -2.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `current_y` is either 1, -1, or 0, `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is now equal to `i + 1`, and `current_x` is now -1, 0, or -2.**
