The value of `current_y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_y` can be either 1, -1, or 0, but this specific value will not affect other variables directly. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are either defined in terms of `current_x` and `current_y` or don't rely on them for this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the potential new values of `current_y` after the increment according to its previous states.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `current_x` is either 0, -1, or 1, `current_y` is either 2, 0, or 1, and `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is now equal to `i + 1`**.
