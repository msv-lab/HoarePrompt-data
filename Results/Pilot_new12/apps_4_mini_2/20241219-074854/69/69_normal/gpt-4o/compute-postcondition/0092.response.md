Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx`, `current_y + dy`, `position_map` is updated with the entry `position_map[current_x, current_y] = i`, and `position_map` may also be updated for `target_pos` based on previous conditions**.
