The variable `current_y` is assigned the value of 0. This does not affect the other variables because they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `current_y` is now 0 while the other variables maintain their previous states.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L'; `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; at least one of the following is true: `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is equal to float('inf'); `current_x` is 0; `current_y` is 0**
