The value of `min_length` is set to positive infinity, representing the initial state where no valid length has been calculated yet. The other variables retain their previous definitions and conditions since no other changes occur.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L'; `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`; at least one of the following is true: `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0; `min_length` is equal to float('inf')**
