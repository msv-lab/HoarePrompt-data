The code modifies the variable `final_y` by decrementing it by 1. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, and `final_x` remain unchanged, while `final_y` will be updated from its initial value of 0. 

Since there are no previously known constraints that limit the value of `final_y`, after the operation, `final_y` will be -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer within -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an integer within -10^9 to 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, the first character of `operations` is not 'U', and the current value of `op` is 'D'.**
