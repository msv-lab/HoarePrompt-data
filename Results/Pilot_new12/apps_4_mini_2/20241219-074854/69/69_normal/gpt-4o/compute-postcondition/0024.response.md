Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is incremented by 1. If `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R', then there are no changes to `final_x`.***
