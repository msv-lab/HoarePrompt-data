Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', and `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is updated to 1 while `current_y` remains 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): 0}, `min_length` is now 1, and `n` is greater than 1, with `i` equal to 1.***
