Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`, `current_x` is either 0, -1, or 1, and `current_y` is either 1, -1, or 0. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is either 1 or `1 - position_map[target_pos]`. Otherwise, the condition for `target_pos` in `position_map` does not lead to any change in variables.***
