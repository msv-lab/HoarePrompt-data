The value of `final_x` is incremented by 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer within -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an integer within -10^9 to 10^9, `final_x` is 1, `final_y` is 0, the first character of `operations` is 'R', and the variable `op` is equal to 'R'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer within -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an integer within -10^9 to 10^9, `final_x` is 1, `final_y` is 0, the first character of `operations` is 'R', and the variable `op` is equal to 'R'.**
