The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1. Since it was initially 0, after the operation, `final_y` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer within -10^9 to 10^9, `y` is an integer within -10^9 to 10^9, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 1, and the first character of `operations` (denoted as `op`) is 'U'**.
