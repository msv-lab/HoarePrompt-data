The variable `dx` is assigned the value `x - final_x`. The value of `final_x` is the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', and `x` remains unchanged. Thus, the output state will reflect the new value of `dx` based on the equation. The values of the other variables are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L'; `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D'; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`.**
