The variable `final_x` is assigned the value 0. This does not depend on the values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0.**
