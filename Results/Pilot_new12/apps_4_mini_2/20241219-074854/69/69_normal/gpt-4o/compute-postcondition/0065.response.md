Postcondition: ***`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L'; `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D'; `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx, current_y + dy`; `current_x` remains 0; `current_y` remains 0; if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is now 1; `position_map` remains {(0, 0): -1}; `n` is greater than 0; `i` remains 0.***
