The loop processes a sequence of operations denoted by characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R', affecting the values of `final_x` and `final_y` based on the direction specified by each operation. 

After all iterations have executed, `final_x` and `final_y` will represent the total movements in the x and y axes, respectively, based on the number of each type of operation processed.

If no operations are provided (i.e., if `n` is 0 or `operations` is an empty string), the values of `final_x` and `final_y` would remain at their initial values of 0.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', based on the operations given in the string `operations`. If `operations` is empty, then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 0.**
