The code snippet updates `min_length` by calculating the minimum value between its current value and the difference `i - position_map[target_pos]`. The values of `final_x`, `final_y`, `target_pos`, and `position_map` are not directly changed, and the impact is solely on `min_length`.

Output State: **`final_x` is equal to the net horizontal movements resulting from 'R' minus 'L', `final_y` is equal to the net vertical movements resulting from 'U' minus 'D', `target_pos` is equal to `current_x + dx`, `current_y + dy`, `position_map[(current_x, current_y)]` is updated to `i + 1`, and `min_length` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`.**
