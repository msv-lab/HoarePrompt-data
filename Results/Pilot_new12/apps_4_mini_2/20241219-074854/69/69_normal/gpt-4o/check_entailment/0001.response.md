Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed in all cases. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
RUUUU
-1 5
```

In this case:

- The robot starts at (0, 0).
- The sequence of operations is "RUUUU", which leads the robot to (1, 5).
- To reach the target (−1, 5), Vasya needs to change the first operation ‘R’ to ‘L’. 

According to the problem, the length of the changed subsegment when the robot changes 'R' to 'L' is computed as follows:

- Changing the index 0 (the 'R' at the beginning) means the length of the segment changed is 0 - 0 + 1 = 1.

However, the program will return `1`, as it does find one operation that needs to change. But in this particular case, to achieve the destination, it should also account that multiple operations may need changing simultaneously. In this scenario, further operations must also be considered if they do not help in reaching the position.

Moreover, the program's logic involves working with positions on a map with coordinates (current_x, current_y) which might lead to incorrect interpretations when computing the needed adjustments. 

Therefore, the program fails to provide the correct output for some edge cases, which makes it incorrect.
