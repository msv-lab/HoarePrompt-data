The provided program attempts to find three integer points that satisfy the conditions outlined in the problem description concerning the area of a triangle formed by these points. 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Area Calculation**: The area of the triangle is calculated using `area = n * m / k`. That's correct for determining if the area can be formed by the triangle given the constraints.
   
2. **Check for Integer Area**:
    - If the computed area is not an integer (`area != int(area)`), it returns "NO". This seems correct since the area needs to be an integer.
   
3. **Check for Zero Area**:
    - After ensuring the area is an integer, if `area == 0`, it also returns "NO". This is correct as a triangle cannot have zero area.

4. **Constructing the Triangle**:
    - The logic attempts to construct points based on whether `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n` or `m`. However, this logic does not appropriately account for all possible configurations for creating a valid triangle. Here's where it starts to falter:
        - The program does not check whether the selected points indeed form a valid triangle (they could be collinear).
        - Furthermore, the choice of points `(0, 0)`, `(2 * area, 1)`, and `(0, 1)` may not always meet bounds since it directly utilizes `2 * area`. 

### Example of Failure:
- Consider the input `n = 4`, `m = 3`, `k = 3`:
  - Here, the computed area would be `4 * 3 / 3 = 4` (which is valid).
  - The code would attempt to use the conditions given, and output:
    ```
    YES
    0 0
    8 1  # This point is out of bounds considering n = 4 and m = 3
    0 1
    ```
    - In this case, the second point goes out of bounds, leading to incorrect output while conforming to the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all possible cases correctly, especially with regards to choosing valid coordinates that form a triangle within the specified range. It lacks checks to ensure the points used are valid under the problem's constraints for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
